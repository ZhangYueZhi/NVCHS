♪The Ink Spots-I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire♪

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:20,270
我无意燃烧这个世界
I don't want to set the world on fire

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:32,015
我只想点燃你心中那团火
I just want to start a flame in your heart

5
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:42,325
我的心中只有一个渴望
In my heart I have but one desire

6
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,264
那就是你
And that one is you

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,271
非你莫属
No other will do

8
00:00:54,271 --> 00:01:00,243
我失去了获得世人称赞的雄心壮志
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,348
我只想成为你的所爱
I just want to be the one you love

10
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,388
只要你承认你也有同样的感觉
And with your admission that you feel the same

11
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,891
我的梦想便能成真
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of

12
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,094
相信我！
Believe me!

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:24,634
我无意燃烧这个世界……
I don't want to set the world on fire...

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
战争
War

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,550
战争从未改变
War never changes

16
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,641
自人类诞生以来
Since the dawn of humankind

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,046
自我们祖先第一次发现石头和骨头的杀伤力起
when our ancestors first discovered the killing power of rock and bone

18
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,450
鲜血就以各种名义染红大地
blood has been spilled in the name of everything

19
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,500
从上帝到正义，再到单纯的暴怒
from God to justice to simple, psychotic rage

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,290
2077年
In the year 2077

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000
经过了数千年的武力冲突
after millennia of armed conflict

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,700
人类毁灭性的天性终于无法遏制
the destructive nature of man could sustain itself no longer

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,042
世界陷入了核火焰与核辐射的深渊
The world was plunged into an abyss of nuclear fire and radiation

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,285
但这却不是预言中的世界末日
But it was not, as some had predicted, the end of the world

25
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,700
恰恰相反
Instead

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,700
世界末日只是人类历史上另一个血腥篇章的序幕而已
the apocalypse was simply the prologue to another bloody chapter of human history

27
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,001
人类成功地毁灭了世界
For man had succeeded in destroying the world

28
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,900
然而战争
but war

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,000
战争从未改变
war never changes

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
在早期
In the early days

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
数以千计的人逃过了这次浩劫
thousands were spared the horrors of the holocaust

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,500
通过躲进巨大的地下掩体，即所谓的 “避难所”
by taking refuge in enormous underground shelters, known as vaults

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
但当他们出来时
But when they emerged

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
迎接他们的只有废墟的地狱
they had only the hell of the wastes to greet them

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
除了101号避难所的人
all except those in Vault 101

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,000
在浩劫当天，当火焰从天而降时
For on that fateful day, when fire rained from the sky

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
101号避难所的巨大钢门缓缓关闭……
the giant steel door of Vault 101 slid closed...

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
再也没有打开
and never reopened

39
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
你在这里出生
It was here you were born

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,500
你将在这里死去
It is here you will die

41
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
因为，在101号避难所
Because, in Vault 101

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
从未有人进来
no one ever enters

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,000
也从未有人离开
and no one ever leaves
