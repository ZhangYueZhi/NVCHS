[Main]
bGTCFix = 1 ; Fixes the 64hz microstutter issue.
bFastExit = 1 ; Prevents the game from hanging on exit.
bRedoHashtables = 1 ; Do not disable this unless you know what you're doing.
bModifyDirectXBehavior = 0 ; Main switch for the DirectX section below.
bEnableThreadingTweaks = 1 ; Miscellaneous threading tweaks which improve overall performance.
bAllowDirectXDebugging = 0 ; Used for debugging. Do not enable unless you know what you're doing.

[Hashtables]
bResizeHashtables = 1 ; Optimizes the game's hashtables which reduces menu lag.

[GTC]
bFPSFix = 1 ; Allows you to run the game at framerates beyond 60 without encountering physics issues.
bAlternateGTCFix = 0 ; Enabling this on AMD processors from the X3D series can improve performance significantly.
bRemoveGTCLimits = 0 ; This removes the GTC limits. It should only be used if your game is running at the wrong speeds. You will need to cap your framerate manually with this enabled.

[ThreadingTweaks]
iTweakRCSafeGuard = 2 ; Set this to 2 if you experience stutters, mode 2 is faster but slightly unstable.
iTweakMiscRendererSafeGuard = 1 ; Set this to 2 if you want more performance at the cost of stability.
bTweakMiscCriticalSections = 1 ; Extra critical section tweaks.
bReplaceDeadlockCSWithWaitAndSleep = 1 ; Possible fix for randomly occuring freeze and crash (most noticeable in TTW).

[FPSFix]
iMaxFPSTolerance = 300 ; Setting the value too high will cause Havok bugs, the max safe value is 496. Do not let your FPS go over this. Not locking your framerate is a bad idea anyway since you will receive a latency penalty and VRR will disengage if you go over refresh rate.
iMinFPSTolerance = 5 ; Minimum tolerance for the high FPS fix. Leave alone unless you know what you're doing.
bfMaxTime = 1 ; Fix for physics issues caused by high FPS.
bSpiderHandsFix = 1 ; Fix for the "spider hands" bug.

[DirectX]
bUseDefaultPoolForTextures = 1 ; Required for high resolution and/or high VRAM usage, breaks Alt-Tab in FSE as a result of losing VRAM contents. Follow performance.moddinglinked.com for more information.
bToggleTripleBuffering = 1 ; The game is double-buffered by default which can cause halved framerates.
