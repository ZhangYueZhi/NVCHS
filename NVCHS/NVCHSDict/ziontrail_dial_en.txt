GID00100006	Can you do anything with this old pump action shotgun?
GID00100007	<Barter 65>
GID00100008	Poke it tin can and get out of my way [Fight]
GID00100009	Are you serious? no trains have run here for over two hundred of years
GID00100010	Sure, here's one
GID00100011	I'm not working, I'm lost, I'll just go back the way I came, bye!
GID00100012	Apology accepted, can I go now?
GID00100013	Whatever
GID00100014	I'm just passing through, you too?
GID00100015	I’m just trying to get a lead on the road ahead, that’s all
GID00100016	I'm Local law enforcement, I've been asked to check out the area
GID00100017	Do you know if the roads are dangerous at all?
GID00100018	What sort of Work permit are we talking about here?
GID00100019	Did you not hear? The world and your precious railway were wiped out
GID00100020	I said there are no trains, no railways, nothing!
GID00100021	Listen, there are no railways, no permits, no rules. Its all been destroyed
GID00100022	Don't you get it? Its all gone!
GID00100023	You must have a fuse loose metal nose,  how about I just dig a hole and bury you
GID00100024	So where is your work permit? and is it in date?
GID00100025	I tried talking to Blu Ray, he wouldn't tell me shit unless I bought something
GID00100026	I’m prospecting, but not had much luck
GID00100027	You wouldn’t be willing to share any hints or advice at all?
GID00100028	I’ve heard some of rumour's of a vault in these parts
GID00100029	Thought maybe I should check them out
GID00100030	Is there anything around here worth looking at?
GID00100031	Are there many raider gangs around this area?
GID00100032	So why are you here then?
GID00100033	Just checking everything is OK, what your business?
GID00100034	I need to make sure there is no trouble here, that clear?
GID00100035	It's either me or the wasteland pal
GID00100036	Careful, you’ve no friends here and the only faction you are a member of is putrefaction
GID00100037	Listen you scabby fuck, decomposing is a serious offence here so you had better start cooperating
GID00100038	I’m not about to start a fight without good reason here so I’m going to walk away today
GID00100039	I think I’m wasting my time talking to you
GID00100040	This is a health and safety spot check. Please show your work permit and it had better be in date
GID00100041	No where, just looking around
GID00100042	[Fight] Just fuck off out of my way dick splash
GID00100043	Through that gate, is there some sort of tax involved here?
GID00100044	What are we talking? would 100 cover it?
GID00100045	There you go, here's your caps...
GID00100046	[Barter] You agreed too quickly, here is 20 and I won’t tell your CO you are skimming of the top
GID00100047	Well you are shit out of luck, I'm not paying
GID00100048	Relax, I just don’t have that money right now
GID00100049	ZkbDoddsTalk36
GID00100050	<Speech 65>
GID00100051	I’ll take my chances
GID00100052	[NCR] Relax trooper we are on the same side, how you doing?
GID00100053	So what's the other side of that gate?
GID00100054	Well, that's the way I'm going
GID00100055	[Terrifying Presence] Where ever I want, now make me happy and say 'over my dead body'
GID00100056	What happened?
GID00100057	Where’s my stuff?
GID00100058	Tell you what, let me out, give me my stuff back and you’ll never see me again
GID00100059	Let me out now or I’m going to kill the fucking lot of you
GID00100060	OK, I screwed up. Can we work a deal here?
GID00100061	I’m not interested
GID00100062	OK, I’m listening
GID00100063	More intelligent?
GID00100064	They are called spore carriers, I’ve seen them before.
GID00100065	How do you know I just won’t skip town if you let me out?
GID00100066	OK I’m in, like I have a choice, I'll need my kit though
GID00100067	It's Done. Lillypad field is cleared of those things.
GID00100068	So what's with all the junk by the way?
GID00100069	OK, I'm done
GID00100070	I'm looking for a place to crash, is this a hotel?
GID00100071	A cage? is a room too much to ask for?
GID00100072	I'll get back to you.
GID00100073	I'll take the one bed cage
GID00100074	I'll need the two bed cage
GID00100075	I just need a bed
GID00100076	Do you trade?
GID00100077	Can I ask you some questions?
GID00100078	Do you get any other groups up this way?
GID00100079	How come this place is here?
GID00100080	Ever come across a vault around these parts?
GID00100081	How far is Zion from here?
GID00100082	Get any NCR around here?
GID00100083	Ever come across Caesars Legion?
GID00100084	Have you heard of Mr House up this far north?
GID00100085	Ever come across Boomers?
GID00100086	Seen any Brotherhood of Steel in these parts?
GID00100087	Are there any Followers of the Apocalypse around here?
GID00100088	Who runs this place?
GID00100089	Where does this tunnel go?
GID00100090	So if this is Rita's Cafe, where is Rita?
GID00100091	Are you serious?
GID00100092	You haven't asked me anything, don't you want to know what's happening down south?
GID00100093	Screw You! [Attack]
GID00100094	What the hell is wrong with your voice? and why are you so small?
GID00100095	Not sure, you're not wearing a label
GID00100096	No, seriously, you have to be having a laugh, literally, is that helium in that mask?
GID00100097	There is no such thing as helium deficiency, and that shit is dangerous
GID00100098	That's not a hiccup, its a full blown fuck up. So you are a failed FEV subject?
GID00100099	Well you sure as shit wasn't a success
GID00100100	Well aren't you the vindictive one. Let me guess, one munchkin joke too many?
GID00100101	No, I think you need to be put out of your misery [Attack]
GID00100102	Yeah, What do you call a green Nightkin?
GID00100103	A munchkin! Get it?
GID00100104	It's not deliberate, I just can't help myself. Now say you are going to rip my arms off.
GID00100105	Sure, I've never been threatened by a munchkin before, this is priceless.
GID00100106	Sorry about that, will it help if I stop laughing?
GID00100107	Do we fight now?
GID00100108	So you have gone from killing me to depressing me, that's a hell of a jump for one conversation.
GID00100109	Got it, find bad guys, kill bad guys, get money. Any chance of a song before I go?
GID00100110	You are offering me work? Have you not noticed I've already fragged a most of your buddies
GID00100111	Thanks, do you know if you were a Nightkin you would be called Neville the Smurf
GID00100112	I can see their point, but what's in it for me?
GID00100113	So is this job cookie related?
GID00100114	No thanks, its been fun and I really mean that, but I need to be going.
GID00100115	Me again, before, you mentioned a job remember?
GID00100116	Job done, all Super Mutants with mean, macho, deep voices done in. Am I scaring you now?
GID00100117	Yes
GID00100118	So how about my key and a victory speech from you.
GID00100119	Hi squeaky, just passing through and wondered if you wanted anyone else killed?
GID00100120	So have you got anything good?
GID00100121	Ok, I'm done here
GID00100122	My mistake, I thought you were selling weapons, not disassembled junk
GID00100123	Hi, are you trading?
GID00100124	Hi, Can you fix something for me?
GID00100125	Hello, can I ask you something?
GID00100126	I'm here to trade
GID00100127	I Need something fixed
GID00100128	That's me, good doing business
GID00100129	Hi, mind if I ask you something?
GID00100130	OK, bye
GID00100131	I take it this is a kind of junk shop
GID00100132	Any NCR up this way?
GID00100133	Was that a Zion tribal I saw wandering around?
GID00100134	Do you have any dealings with Vegas this far north?
GID00100135	Surely these 'savages' have as much right to be here as you have
GID00100136	Well that's ok, cause I'm not one of them
GID00100137	You been there then?
GID00100138	Do you know this area well?
GID00100139	Anything around here that I should know about?
GID00100140	My business is my own
GID00100141	Adventure, fame, riches, all the usual stuff
GID00100142	Have you come across any NCR this far north?
GID00100143	Ever come across Legion around here?
GID00100144	Ok, I'm done, I'll see you around
GID00100145	Do you know anything about a vault in these parts?
GID00100146	<Speech 85>
GID00100147	Which direction is that? So there is a vault then...
GID00100148	Have you been inside?
GID00100149	Relax, I’m not after a guided tour, just some details, a location perhaps?
GID00100150	So why pretend to be ignorant of it? What's wrong with this place? 
GID00100151	That will do, I've seen better
GID00100152	Hey, I'm just telling it like it is
GID00100153	Nice place you live in, great water features and you're own railway
GID00100154	Do you know Zion? Is this the right road?
GID00100155	Is this place a flop house?
GID00100156	So there is no problem with resting up and crashing here then?
GID00100157	I’ve been to Vault 616, an interesting place
GID00100158	<Perception 8>
GID00100159	OK
GID00100160	Sorry, that was rude, I didn't mean to sound ungrateful
GID00100161	I would really appreciate it if I could borrow your work bench, I won't be long
GID00100162	100 caps for killing this Ris character you said, if the offer is still open I'm in
GID00100163	So how come you are here?
GID00100164	<Speech 55>
GID00100165	Hey, can I use your reloading bench? You would really be helping me out
GID00100166	So what have you got?
GID00100167	I need some stuff fixing, can you manage that?
GID00100168	Ok, I’m done, see you around
GID00100169	Maybe you can help me, I'm after some information
GID00100170	Burgess? I think I've already killed him
GID00100171	<Speech 55>
GID00100172	No, I’m not interested in that
GID00100173	So what is there around these parts?
GID00100174	I meant what has Hayford got to offer
GID00100175	Hotel, lounge, bar and casino? You mean the flop house?
GID00100176	Bar?
GID00100177	Lounge?
GID00100178	Casino?
GID00100179	ZkbBluRay
GID00100180	What about the rest of Hayford
GID00100181	Sure, I get it, you own the place, and north?
GID00100182	Nice place, I love the wallpaper it looks just like piles of sandbags
GID00100183	You don’t mind being shot at?
GID00100184	Isn’t that kind of dangerous selling them ammo?
GID00100185	I take you don’t sell them any heavy ordnance then?
GID00100186	I think it best if you do your own dirty work
GID00100187	Do I look like some sort of wandering killer?
GID00100188	What sort of people get this way?
GID00100189	Do you get any NCR up here?
GID00100190	Ever come across Caesars Legion?
GID00100191	Do you have any dealings with the strip?
GID00100192	Have boomers ever ventured up this way?
GID00100193	Ever heard of the brotherhood of Steel?
GID00100194	Any followers around?
GID00100195	You know anything about a vault around here?
GID00100196	Strange that, I've recently been to Vault 616 which nobody seems to know about
GID00100197	So why is everyone denying they know anything about it?
GID00100198	I'm guessing you trade with them, I just hate to think what you trade
GID00100199	You were planning to take the vault for yourself's, just didn't want to advertise it
GID00100200	You sold them your blood in exchange for protection
GID00100201	I reckon a lot of you folk came from that vault and are not too proud of your history
GID00100202	Maybe you all new about the experiments and wanted in, you wanted immortality
GID00100203	I'm a little wired Doc, I think I might be addicted to something.
GID00100204	On second thought, I'll be fine.
GID00100205	Yes, cure me.
GID00100206	I'm a bit chewed up Doc, can you sort me out?
GID00100207	All right, here's your money.
GID00100208	Here's your money.
GID00100209	All right, fix me.
GID00100210	I think I'll tough it out.
GID00100211	Can you heal my radiation? I've got a warm fuzzy feeling, but not in a good way
GID00100212	No, thanks.
GID00100213	Do it.
GID00100214	I'm after trading some medical supplies, you interested?
GID00100215	Relax, I thought this was a medical center, do you treat people here?
GID00100216	But you don't give it away, you only treat people if they can pay
GID00100217	OK, you have my attention
GID00100218	OK I'm in, what am I looking for?
GID00100219	OK, you got a deal
GID00100220	Ris is dead, go look at the body if you want to, I'm not dragging it over here
GID00100221	What if I don't have any money?
GID00100222	Hell no, just checking the ground rules
GID00100223	I'm done here
GID00100224	Some protocol, I thought the followers were meant to help people, not squeeze them for money
GID00100225	I've checked on Burgess and hacked his computer, he's an NCR Mercenary
GID00100226	Was there something else?
GID00100227	He was contracted by the NCR to look for a VaultTec Vault around here
GID00100228	And he was interested in places called 'Ground House' and 'Rita's Cafe'? Know them?
GID00100229	Ris? The Raider queen who wears a goat on her head? I've already killed her
GID00100230	OK, I'm done here
GID00100231	Yeah, I'm hungry
GID00100232	Well I'm hungry now
GID00100233	OK, I'm finished
GID00100234	OK, I'm finished
GID00100235	That's a seriously stroppy kid out front, she needs to learn some manners
GID00100236	Alright, I'll shut up and keep my opinions to myself
GID00100237	Well you look like you just crawled out from under a rock, but I'm not judging
GID00100238	With what? your razor sharp intellect? I'll take my chances
GID00100239	Fame, riches, peace throughout the Mojave, but if you can't manage that I'll make do with some food
GID00100240	Food, why the fuck else would I be here, sure as shit not for the service
GID00100241	And maybe I should shoot you in the face.
GID00100242	Missed me sweet pea, how about you and me get up close and personal
GID00100243	Lets cut out the small talk, just give me the menu
GID00100244	Shut up and get me some food before I hit you
GID00100245	This job, what exactly would you want me to do?
GID00100246	Just give me the menu or I'll throw you over the fucking balcony
GID00100247	Ever heard of 'Ground House'? I found a reference to it prospecting, but the file was corrupted
GID00100248	Blu Ray said I should come and talk to you about Ground House, you know this place?
GID00100249	<Speech 90>
GID00100250	Ok, is there anything I should know before I go in?
GID00100251	OK, I'm in, I'll weed your garden, you cut me in on this 'Ground House' thing
GID00100252	Well I'm back, I've been to your Ground House and it was a complete waste of time
GID00100253	The place was looted just after the war. There was just Ghouls, bugs, rodents and stinking water
GID00100254	<Barter 50>
GID00100255	I'll take the 45 Submachine gun
GID00100256	I'll take the hunting rifle
GID00100257	How long do I get one of these cages for?
GID00100258	Where's the north gate?
GID00100259	Where's the south gate?
GID00100260	I've been sent by the Sarge to do a quick clearance patrol of the road
GID00100261	OK thanks, I'm finished here
GID00100262	So what do you have to trade?
GID00100263	No, I'm just looking around
GID00100264	Can I ask you something?
GID00100265	Not really, are you part of the farm? how's that going?
GID00100266	So what can you tell me about this place?
GID00100267	My business is none of yours
GID00100268	Do you know any thing about the NCR?
GID00100269	Ever come across Caesars Legion?
GID00100270	Any here though?
GID00100271	I'm looking for any information on a vault in these parts
GID00100272	I take it you don't think there is one
GID00100273	You think so? That's odd cause I've been there
GID00100274	Nothing, just passing the time off day
GID00100275	Well I'm done, bye
GID00100276	Do you know that Ghoul Burgess? I'm kind of curious about him
GID00100277	Not a ghoul fan then? I'm just after some background, so do you know him at all?
GID00100278	But you can't tell me anything specific?
GID00100279	I could scrap better quality products of the fucking road
GID00100280	I thought Follower's protocols were a bit more generous than that
GID00100281	Whoa there, I got money, I'm just getting a handle on things
GID00100282	So who around here shoots at you?
