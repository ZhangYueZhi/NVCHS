DLC20000001	GREETING
DLC20000002	You friend of Sorrows, yes? Together we smash White Legs that defile holy places, yes?
DLC20000003	Outman! Kuna-man mad! He kill all White Legs! You talk! You stop!
DLC20000004	Foolish outman - You best White Legs, you think? By my spear you die!
DLC20000005	...
DLC20000006	Visions guide you. You listen? Heh. Maybe yes, maybe no.
DLC20000007	Hola, outsider. Welcome, child of omens. You come to receive visions of truth?
DLC20000008	You have root of Sacred Datura?
DLC20000009	These roots make sacred vision tea. You drink, you see path before you. Ready?
DLC20000010	Does Ghost of She lie quiet in grave?
DLC20000011	Daniel said that I was to travel with you until you have completed your scouting. Is this pleasing to you?
DLC20000012	Have you reconsidered allowing me to travel with you?
DLC20000013	You are the one Joshua Graham sent to us. Blessings of the Father in the Cave on you - Daniel is waiting for you.
DLC20000014	Greetings and blessings to you. Daniel still awaits you.
DLC20000015	Katu Veo. Blessings of the Father in the Cave on you.
DLC20000016	Katu Veo.
DLC20000017	We go. White Legs go back to Great Salt.
DLC20000018	Unless you and Joshua have any objections, I'd like to start evacuating the Sorrows. I'm going to need your help, so say your piece.
DLC20000019	Please, have you done everything you can for the Sorrows? Are they all accounted for?!
DLC20000020	Hoi! White Legs don't leave survivors often. You're some kind of lucky, let me tell you.
DLC20000021	You came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
DLC20000022	Hoi! What you doing? There's still White Legs back there!
DLC20000023	Wait - you came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
DLC20000024	Yah ah tahg! I saw you at the southern passage - you... um... you do know there were still White Legs alive when you ran off, right?
DLC20000025	Joshua says you need someone to guide you around the valley. He said I should go with you, if you want.
DLC20000026	Change your mind about bringing me along?
DLC20000027	Good job getting those supplies to Daniel. If you were a Dead Horse, you'd get a tattoo for that.
DLC20000028	You again? Talk to Joshua yet?
DLC20000029	What can I tell you?
DLC20000030	Come on, come on, no time to waste!
DLC20000031	Howdy, friend. Heard my little broadcast, did you? Yeah, you look the type.
DLC20000032	Howdy, friend. Heard my little broadcast, did you? Yeah, you look the type.
DLC20000033	Damn good thing you came along. Now that Ricky's skedaddled, yours is the only Pip-Boy we got.
DLC20000034	Are you here to jaw at me a while longer, or are we ready to get this show on the road?
DLC20000035	We smash White Legs now, yes?
DLC20000036	Well, here we part ways. I'm needed back at the Dead Horses camp - maybe I'll see you there sometime.
DLC20000037	This is taking too long. We can't let Salt-Upon-Wounds escape. I'm going to find a way around. God willing, we will finish this together.
DLC20000038	The time for talk has passed. The Lord's work must be done.
DLC20000039	Daniel must have made it to the tunnel by now, but there are Sorrows all over the valley! We have to help them and get Daniel out of here!
DLC20000040	We should have given you a better welcome on your first visit to Zion, but from what I hear, the White Legs beat us to it.
DLC20000041	White Legs seem to be the only visitors we have these days, and I wouldn't have expected anyone from the Mojave to come looking for us.
DLC20000042	And you're a courier, no less. Not the one I was expecting, but I suppose he wouldn't have come with a caravan.
DLC20000043	I don't know if you were close to the other members of your group, but you have my sympathy.
DLC20000044	I pray for the safety of all good people who come to Zion, even Gentiles, but we can't expect God to do all the work.
DLC20000045	Welcome back. What can I do for you?
DLC20000046	You looking for trouble, bud? I got plenty to spare, so watch your ass around me.
DLC20000047	You looking to join this here caravan? Look a little wet behind the ears, you ask me.
DLC20000048	Hey, little lady. Don't be scared to join this caravan! I'll keep a close eye on you - real close. Promises.
DLC20000049	Yeah? What's it this time?
DLC20000050	Fuck off, okay? I hate you!
DLC20000051	I may have been exaggerating a little. Truth is, I got this suit and the Pit-Boy off a dead prospector who came out from Zion.
DLC20000052	Guy was dead when I found him, okay? Had a ton of shit on him. That's how I know there's good loot in Zion, see?
DLC20000053	Fuck off, I'm busy!
DLC20000054	Looking to join this caravan, huh? Look to me like you can handle yourself.
DLC20000055	Something on your mind?
DLC20000056	Leave me be. Busy.
DLC20000057	Welcome back. What can I do for you?
DLC20000058	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.
DLC20000059	Goot.
DLC20000060	Yah ah tahg.
DLC20000061	Hoi!
DLC20000062	Please, is it time? Is everyone safe? We have to go!
DLC20000063	Uh... I apologize if this comes across as a less-than-cordial welcome, but how did you get in here? You from the Mojave?
DLC20000064	Do me a favor and go to talk to Joshua, all right?
DLC20000065	The Dead Horses told me details about the attack on your caravan. A stranger's sympathy might not count for much, but for what it's worth, I'm sorry.
DLC20000066	The Sorrows will mourn your friends, too. They mourn everyone, even the White Legs. They have sensitive souls. Innocent, if there is such a thing.
DLC20000067	In spite of what's happened, I hope that Joshua and I can help you out of here. But to be frank, we need your help, too.
DLC20000068	I'm glad to see you're still with us. How can I help you?
DLC20000069	Holadu, Tsagasee.
DLC20000070	Holadu, Na'ne.
DLC20000071	Katu Veo. Nayoo?
DLC20000072	Wise man knows when to shut mouth. You maybe wise. Or maybe not.
DLC20000073	Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... capacious. So very dear.
DLC20000074	Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.
DLC20000075	That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day.
DLC20000076	But the bombs fell first. Suffice it to say, the delivery was never made.
DLC20000077	PLAYER THROW GRENADE
DLC20000078	Frag out!
DLC20000079	Fire in the hole!
DLC20000080	Grenah!

DLC20000086	Deha ruido!
DLC20000087	No discarge armoos!
DLC20000088	Be careful. Tribals don't always recognize those for what they are.
DLC20000089	Watch it. You can't just go tossing those all over Zion.
DLC20000090	Ah del tahi, bahm buh, ya?
DLC20000091	A bil he neh fuhr jahd thli gai! Heh he!
DLC20000092	Ke cosa estee-na?
DLC20000093	Por ke katu pongwa estee?
DLC20000094	You're not the first to have tried.
DLC20000095	Make the first shot count. You won't get a second.
DLC20000096	Do'an poin aiti ay me!
DLC20000097	Subai thah, tsahh.

DLC20000102	Attack
DLC20000103	Had enough?
DLC20000104	Come on!
DLC20000105	You like that?
DLC20000106	Take it!
DLC20000107	Die where you stand!
DLC20000108	Prepare to meet your maker.
DLC20000109	Ahm naaiyawi wichoo!

DLC20000121	Gotcha!
DLC20000122	Hah!
DLC20000123	Hit
DLC20000124	Hmph!
DLC20000125	Ugh!
DLC20000126	Oof!
DLC20000127	Ahh!
DLC20000128	Argh!

DLC20000148	Me no kaade muerna!
DLC20000149	Me no kaade akee!
DLC20000150	This is too intense!
DLC20000151	We are outmatched!
DLC20000152	They're too strong for us!
DLC20000153	Time to get lost!
DLC20000154	This is a battle we cannot win!
DLC20000155	Steal
DLC20000156	That doesn't belong to you!
DLC20000157	You can't just take that!
DLC20000158	Thief!
DLC20000159	We're a tolerant community, but don't overstep the limits of our generosity.
DLC20000160	This isn't a New Vegas back alley. Watch what you grab.
DLC20000161	No! Shtay len tahbah mah ee.

DLC20000166	Um... you know I'll share if you ask, right?
DLC20000167	Is... is this some kind of civilized ritual I just don't get?
DLC20000168	Is thievery not considered wrong where you come from?
DLC20000169	Is your need for possessions truly so great?
DLC20000170	Better not try that again.
DLC20000171	That sort of thing might be seen as a dumb prank in the Mojave, but it will get you killed out here.
DLC20000172	Maiku.
DLC20000173	Lah.
DLC20000174	Paz patasooba.
DLC20000175	Assault
DLC20000176	What the hell?!
DLC20000177	What was that for?
DLC20000178	You dirty coward!

DLC20000180	Ye have sown death and so shall ye reap it!

DLC20000190	That's enough!
DLC20000191	<Roar of anger.>

DLC20000198	Whoa! Was that necessary?
DLC20000199	Are you sick in the head or something?
DLC20000200	What demon would possess you to do such a thing?
DLC20000201	Are you suffering a brain fever? I have herbs that can curb such... violent tendencies.

DLC20000220	Ehrr!
DLC20000221	A pointless death.
DLC20000222	That should have been avoided.

DLC20000228	Remind me not to get you mad at me.
DLC20000229	Guess that was just bound to happen, huh?
DLC20000230	I don't much like your way of solving problems.
DLC20000231	I regret that necessity.
DLC20000232	Get down!

DLC20000284	You'd better get out of here if you know what's good for you.
DLC20000285	Keep moving.
DLC20000286	You'd better get out of here.
DLC20000287	Katu no kaade akee.

DLC20000326	We seem to be safe for the moment.
DLC20000327	Never mind. I was wrong.
DLC20000328	Must have left.
DLC20000329	Hmm. Nothing.
DLC20000330	Huh. Maybe I need some sleep.

DLC20000354	Never stood a chance, did they?
DLC20000355	Messy business - I am glad it's over.
DLC20000356	Let's move on - I don't like to linger in this place.
DLC20000357	Where'd you go?
DLC20000358	Yes, hide. Run and hide in fear.
DLC20000359	Slink away. Squeeze between the rocks if you can.
DLC20000360	Hiding, are you? Well, I'm coming to find you.
DLC20000361	Whar d'yoo go?

DLC20000372	I cannot find them!
DLC20000373	Where are they?
DLC20000374	Guess she's gone.
DLC20000375	Guess he's gone.
DLC20000376	Huh. Looks like they left.
DLC20000377	Only a matter of time.
DLC20000378	Time will run out on you yet.
DLC20000379	Hide while you can.
DLC20000380	Eno.

DLC20000389	They must've run off. Scared of us, huh?
DLC20000390	I don't think they're coming back.
DLC20000391	They're gone. Perhaps that means we don't have to kill them.
DLC20000392	I think our enemy has fled.
DLC20000393	There you are!
DLC20000394	Let's end this.
DLC20000395	Judgment's coming.
DLC20000396	Time's up.

DLC20000406	Gotcha!
DLC20000407	Thought you could get away from Follows-Chalk?
DLC20000408	There you are!
DLC20000409	I found them!
DLC20000410	Who's there?
DLC20000411	Hmm....
DLC20000412	I am not giving up the search yet.
DLC20000413	Stay cautious.
DLC20000414	I'm still looking, don't worry.
DLC20000415	Someone there?
DLC20000416	Don't try to hide from me.
DLC20000417	You can't stay hidden forever.
DLC20000418	Ahm stih bui-neeking.
DLC20000419	Haganai yoo?
DLC20000420	Ahn yoo here stih?
DLC20000421	Shih zookuh ta tee...
DLC20000422	Voh ni ar?
DLC20000423	Ni ar heer?
DLC20000424	Ke estee-na?
DLC20000425	Me escuchu algue-na?
DLC20000426	Ke ruido estee-na?
DLC20000427	I'll find you.
DLC20000428	You'll be back. I can still smell you.
DLC20000429	Gave up? Wise choice.
DLC20000430	Gone. No matter. I'll find you.
DLC20000431	Ahm nananga yoo.
DLC20000432	Mabe yoo gaihaiwa?
DLC20000433	Haganai yoo?
DLC20000434	Ee sists ah.
DLC20000435	Dah tse ni ar gey gonen.
DLC20000436	Voh ni ar?
DLC20000437	Katu no n'veo de me!
DLC20000438	Me olfale katu!
DLC20000439	Me val a discube katu.
DLC20000440	Still looking, but I got nothing.
DLC20000441	Still nothing here.
DLC20000442	Do you see them?
DLC20000443	Where are they?
DLC20000444	Estee no luchoo mela!
DLC20000445	Me no kaade partu estee.
DLC20000446	Howdy. My name is Jed Masterson, and I'm a caravan boss for the Happy Trails Caravan Company.
DLC20000447	If you're hearing this, I have a job offer for you. Happy Trails is organizing an expedition north into Utah, off the Long 15, and we need people.
DLC20000448	We're looking for caravan guards, prospectors, couriers - if you're used to humping it across the Wastes straight toward trouble, we want you.
DLC20000449	If you've got a Pip-Boy, we definitely want you.
DLC20000450	On the other hand, if you're a greenhorn or a city-slicker spinning tales about your skills, you can kindly go hang.
DLC20000451	If we like your gumption, we'll pay you square and treat you fair. Find me, Jed Masterson, at the Northern Passage if you're interested. Luck to you.
DLC20000452	They killed him!
DLC20000453	They killed her!
DLC20000454	Look out!
DLC20000455	We'll get 'em.
DLC20000456	Flank 'em!
DLC20000457	There will be time to grieve later.
DLC20000458	Let this death mean something.
DLC20000459	Yoo murdah my hainji!
DLC20000460	No! Net yoo!
DLC20000461	Roo too nait, ahk iss.
DLC20000462	No! Neekt ni!
DLC20000463	Nona! Ud muerna!
DLC20000464	Ud matanna mes!
DLC20000465	Joshua isn't going to like this....
DLC20000466	Hey! Don't die on me now!
DLC20000467	This is how violence always ends....
DLC20000468	I wish I could have saved you.
DLC20000469	Wait here.
DLC20000470	Sure, okay. I'll wait behind. Not like I'm not used to that.
DLC20000471	As you wish. I will wait, but please do not be gone long.
DLC20000472	Sorry. That's not going to happen.
DLC20000473	Let's trade equipment.
DLC20000474	Well then, let's get to trading.
DLC20000475	If something of mine will help you, take it. I hope you would do the same for me.
DLC20000476	No thanks.
DLC20000477	Enough about tactics.
DLC20000478	What can I do?
DLC20000479	I will do my best to follow your requests.
DLC20000480	Anything else?
DLC20000481	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
DLC20000482	Sure... you are going to leave me some chalk marks to follow though, right?
DLC20000483	I'll give you room to work, then.
DLC20000484	As you like.
DLC20000485	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
DLC20000486	Lead on, I'll follow.
DLC20000487	Off we go, then.
DLC20000488	After you.
DLC20000489	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000490	What can I do?
DLC20000491	What else is there to talk about?
DLC20000492	Anything else?
DLC20000493	Stay close to me.
DLC20000494	Fine by me - get too far back and it's easy to lose your partner in this maze.
DLC20000495	I will do my best to stay close.
DLC20000496	I'm at your side.
DLC20000497	Stick close to me.
DLC20000498	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
DLC20000499	Just tell me where to be, and I'll be there.
DLC20000500	How close do you prefer me to follow?
DLC20000501	Whatever you'd like. It makes no difference to me.
DLC20000502	I want you to use ranged weapons.
DLC20000503	Keeping my distance sounds more my speed anyways.
DLC20000504	My skills lie elsewhere, but I will do as you bid.
DLC20000505	Naturally.
DLC20000506	Switch to a melee weapon.
DLC20000507	Up close and personal? Well, as long as they don't have guns.
DLC20000508	I will fight with my fists as best I can.
DLC20000509	Fine. If that's your style, I can adapt.
DLC20000510	Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000511	What can I do?
DLC20000512	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000513	What did you have in mind?
DLC20000514	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000515	Anything else?
DLC20000516	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000517	That's all. Let's get going.
DLC20000518	Lead on, I'll follow.
DLC20000519	I will try to follow your example.
DLC20000520	All right.
DLC20000521	I want you to change your combat style.
DLC20000522	Change it to...?
DLC20000523	How shall I fight?
DLC20000524	Oh?
DLC20000525	Let's talk about your tactics.
DLC20000526	Tactics? You know I'm not much of a fighter, right?
DLC20000527	Battle is not my strongest skill, but I am eager to learn from you.
DLC20000528	What have you to teach me of tactics?
DLC20000529	Let's get going.
DLC20000530	Right behind you.
DLC20000531	I walk in your footsteps.
DLC20000532	It's time for us to part ways.
DLC20000533	You sure? It's easy to get lost out here without a guide.
DLC20000534	Go back to your people's camp.
DLC20000535	Daniel was firm about my staying with you. Are you certain?
DLC20000536	Go back to your people's camp.
DLC20000537	Ha ha ha. I don't think so.
DLC20000538	I think we should travel together.
DLC20000539	Joshua said I might be going with you. Let's go then!
DLC20000540	I want you to travel with me.
DLC20000541	I am happy to offer you what guidance I can. Let's go.
DLC20000542	I want you to travel with me.
DLC20000543	The path lies before us. Let's not waste any time.
DLC20000544	God protect me!
DLC20000545	Lord, make me thy instrument!
DLC20000546	God and liberty!
DLC20000547	Deyai-yoo, devil!
DLC20000548	Wes run!
DLC20000549	Nikumpa me!
DLC20000550	Momewi de luchoo!
DLC20000551	Mes luchoo ahorla!
DLC20000552	Me derote katu!
DLC20000553	Shtairb, chin dee!
DLC20000554	Sohl tyeh!
DLC20000555	Dah ah hi meer!
DLC20000556	Let's take them!
DLC20000557	This one's mine!
DLC20000558	I'm with you.
DLC20000559	Let's go!
DLC20000560	For the Sorrows!
DLC20000561	Hyah!
DLC20000562	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
DLC20000563	Glad to hear it. I wouldn't want to go back to Joshua alone.
DLC20000564	Good. Daniel's decisions are wise. You are wise for respecting them.
DLC20000565	Good, because I wasn't going to leave.
DLC20000566	Yes, I'm sure.
DLC20000567	All right. Joshua won't be too happy, but all right.
DLC20000568	If that is your wish, I cannot change your mind. I will wait for you at the Sorrows' camp until you return.
DLC20000569	I'm not going anywhere. Get the idea out of your head and get moving.
DLC20000570	Got it.
DLC20000571	As you say.
DLC20000572	Yes, of course.
DLC20000573	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
DLC20000574	Now you're thinking like a hunter! I like this plan.
DLC20000575	That seems sensible. I'd prefer to let you choose the targets.
DLC20000576	What's the point?
DLC20000577	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
DLC20000578	You're starting to sound like the old Joshua. Okay, got it.
DLC20000579	Isn't a more diplomatic approach preferable? Very well, but I'm not comfortable with this.
DLC20000580	It's the only way I know.
DLC20000581	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
DLC20000582	Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said, "Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation."
DLC20000583	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed. Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
DLC20000584	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
DLC20000585	Do you know what it means?
DLC20000586	If I don't make it... tell Joshua... I tried.
DLC20000587	Looks like I'm headed for the big dark....
DLC20000588	Sorry... I let you down....
DLC20000589	Even my best herbs won't work if I'm dead... I need help!
DLC20000590	I will not leave my children orphans!
DLC20000591	If I fall... save the Sorrows... please.
DLC20000592	I could use some help here!
DLC20000593	I won't last long at this rate!
DLC20000594	Can I get some backup? Healing? Something?
DLC20000595	My wounds are getting worse!
DLC20000596	I can't keep up this pace much longer!
DLC20000597	I need healing powder!
DLC20000598	Wake
DLC20000599	This is not the most pleasant place I've woken up.
DLC20000600	My head feels about to burst. At least that means I'm still alive.
DLC20000601	Is it normal to hurt all over after a battle?
DLC20000602	Oh, look, I'm not dead.
DLC20000603	Okay, okay, I'm up. What's next?
DLC20000604	They're cutting through me like paper!
DLC20000605	This armor is useless!
DLC20000606	I cannot defend myself against this!
DLC20000607	I need better armor!
DLC20000608	I don't think I'm hurting them at all!
DLC20000609	Are you sure this weapon actually works?
DLC20000610	My attacks are doing nothing!
DLC20000611	Might as well tickle them with a feather!
DLC20000612	Got anything bigger I can fight with?
DLC20000613	No more bullets!
DLC20000614	I'm shooting dry here!
DLC20000615	I have no more bullets!
DLC20000616	I need a reload!
DLC20000617	My guns are empty!
DLC20000618	There... hopefully it won't fall off now.
DLC20000619	Now that's good medicine!
DLC20000620	This is much more effective than I expected!
DLC20000621	If only I had more of this medicine to share with the tribe.
DLC20000622	Crippled
DLC20000623	Ahh! I'm going to need a healer!
DLC20000624	Hope you've got medicine better than some sticky herbs!
DLC20000625	I fear I will need more than my herbs to fix this....
DLC20000626	This wound is grievous! I need help!
DLC20000627	Regenerating
DLC20000628	Good as new!
DLC20000629	Just what the medicine man ordered!
DLC20000630	That should keep me going a while longer.
DLC20000631	Much improved.
DLC20000632	I feel better already.
DLC20000633	Poison
DLC20000634	Feeling the poison here!
DLC20000635	I'm not feeling so good....
DLC20000636	I've been poisoned!
DLC20000637	This wound needs to be sucked out, quickly!
DLC20000638	I need some Radscorpion glands and Nightstalker blood to treat this poison.
DLC20000639	I look like a pack Brahmin to you? Come on, we travel light!
DLC20000640	I will be more useful to you traveling light.
DLC20000641	Like the shadow of a ghost.
DLC20000642	We pass like moonlight on still water.
DLC20000643	Yes.
DLC20000644	I need to think about this.
DLC20000645	Even our Lord had doubts. Think it over, but listen to your heart. And do it quickly. We don't have much time.
DLC20000646	Don't worry. I think leaving Zion is for the best.
DLC20000647	It may be. I hope it is. To tell the truth, if something goes wrong, more Sorrows could die in the escape than in Joshua's proposed attack.
DLC20000648	Even knowing that, it's a risk I have to take. With your help, and Joshua's, even if we're attacked, we can defend the Sorrows and escape.
DLC20000649	We'll be traveling at night, in small groups, across the valley. With luck, the White Legs won't know what's happened until the next morning.
DLC20000650	But if the White Legs realize what's happening... Joshua and I will need you to help us escape. Don't hold back. I promise you, the White Legs won't.
DLC20000651	Once our path is clear, I'll give you everything you need to get back to the Mojave, but the Pine Creek tunnel must be collapsed behind us.
DLC20000652	It's the only way to delay the White Legs' pursuit long enough for us to get a head start. Good luck, and may God be with us.
DLC20000653	I think Joshua's right. We should fight the White Legs.
DLC20000654	No. Why? Why? Haven't you seen enough of what's going on here to see that the Sorrows don't need to butcher the White Legs for a piece of land?
DLC20000655	What Joshua wants is more than an attack. He wants a slaughter. And he needs more than you and the Dead Horses to do it.
DLC20000656	The Sorrows can't be pushed into this. You and Joshua don't have the right to force them into it. Please, consider what I'm saying.
DLC20000657	I checked on everything in the valley and got you the map of Grand Staircase.
DLC20000658	I appreciate it. Well, that's it. This is all we need. Now all that's left is to quietly pack up and try to get out of here without being noticed.
DLC20000659	That's assuming that Joshua won't try to stop me. And that he hasn't talked you into fighting the White Legs despite what I've said.
DLC20000660	Don't worry. I don't hold it against you. You're a -  an outsider. Fighting seems like the practical solution. But there's more than that at stake.
DLC20000661	Joshua told me you needed a few things. I think this is everything.
DLC20000662	Well I'll be. I was starting to lose hope we'd be able to get any of this, much less all of it. Tribals are smart but... well, they're ignorant.
DLC20000663	Letting go of a taboo is difficult for them, so I knew it would have to be one of us. Turns out all it took was a Gentile. Or, uh... no offense.
DLC20000664	These supplies are a godsend, but if we're going to evacuate Zion without drawing more White Leg attention, I need you to go back into the valley.
DLC20000665	Specifically, I need you to scout out some locations for White Legs and try to recover a map of Grand Staircase, a wilderness area to the east.
DLC20000666	There's also the matter of the roads. We're going to be heading out of the east side of the park, but I'm not sure the way is clear.
DLC20000667	What? I don't know what "visions of truth" means.
DLC20000668	Take drugs! Kill a bear!
DLC20000669	Seek medicine plant! Return with Sacred Datura Root! Receive visions of truth, they guide you!
DLC20000670	Umm... Goodbye.
DLC20000671	Not yet. I had some questions first.
DLC20000672	It's done.
DLC20000673	Then visions of truth are at an end. Will you learn from truth? Maybe yes. Maybe no. Only for you to decide.
DLC20000674	Here, take. Gift, to remind you of visions. Use well. Or sell to curio trader. Either way, says much about you.
DLC20000675	Not yet. I need a moment.
DLC20000676	Tea will wait. Me? Maybe not.
DLC20000677	All right, let's do this.
DLC20000678	Drink. Tea is strong. Tea is bitter. Wisdom is strong. Wisdom is bitter. You see?
DLC20000679	Not yet. I had some questions first.
DLC20000680	I have the sacred datura here.
DLC20000681	These roots make sacred vision tea. You drink, you see path before you. Ready?
DLC20000682	I'm ready to go to Zion.
DLC20000683	Just like that, huh? You got guts, I'll give you that. You sure you want to jump in blind? Ain't got no questions about where we're going or why?
DLC20000684	Okay, let's do it! Zion here we come!
DLC20000685	I bet you are, but we only got room for one more on this expedition. You'll have to leave your friends behind.
DLC20000686	We're all ready to get going.
DLC20000687	I bet you are, but we only got room for one more on this expedition. You'll have to leave your friend behind.
DLC20000688	We're both set. Let's go.
DLC20000689	I bet you are, but you ain't going nowhere loaded down like a pack brahmin.
DLC20000690	I bet you are, but you ain't going nowhere loaded down like a pack brahmin.
DLC20000691	Are you now? You know we ain't coming back this way for a good long while now, right? And you know about the weight limit?
DLC20000692	I don't want no whining about "Oh, Mr. Masterson, I left my one-of-a-kind plasma cannon back at base, can we go back for it?"
DLC20000693	You sure you're ready now?
DLC20000694	All right, let's go. I'm ready.
DLC20000695	You sure about that this time? We ain't coming back for a while.
DLC20000696	No, not yet.
DLC20000697	Hurry! There isn't any time to waste! We have to get out of here and collapse the tunnel behind us!
DLC20000698	Yes, go!
DLC20000699	You've done more than I could have ever hoped for. Thank you. And may God protect you for all of your days. Goodbye.
DLC20000700	You let them die! They needed you! Why didn't you help them?!
DLC20000701	Nevermind. I don't have time for this. Take the map. Just take it and go!
DLC20000702	Your power is broken. You cannot hope to prevail here. Leave this valley in peace.
DLC20000703	We leave, but always fight, White Legs! We strong warriors for Caesar!
DLC20000704	Time to die, General Gobbledegook!
DLC20000705	You mock White Legs! You die now!
DLC20000706	Wait! There's no reason this has to end in bloodshed!
DLC20000707	[SUCCEEDED] You speak. I listen. Kill you, maybe I not. Maybe.
DLC20000708	[FAILED] Weak words you talk! Now you see strong spears better than weak words!
DLC20000709	Can't we just, you know, be friends?
DLC20000710	That's all. Let's get going.
DLC20000711	Enough about tactics. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000712	You're good. Let's get going.
DLC20000713	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000714	Spread out and keep your distance from me.
DLC20000715	Stay close to me.
DLC20000716	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
DLC20000717	Wait here.
DLC20000718	I want to trade equipment.
DLC20000719	I want you to use ranged weapons.
DLC20000720	I don't want you to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
DLC20000721	Switch to a melee weapon.
DLC20000722	That's all. Let's get going.
DLC20000723	Lead on, I'll follow.
DLC20000724	I will try to follow your example.
DLC20000725	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000726	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
DLC20000727	I want you to change your combat style.
DLC20000728	Let's talk about your tactics.
DLC20000729	Let's go.
DLC20000730	I want you to travel with me.
DLC20000731	Yes, I'm sure.
DLC20000732	No, I've changed my mind.
DLC20000733	Go back to your people's camp.
DLC20000734	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... all right, I reckon you know your limits.
DLC20000735	You keel over on me out there, though, and I'll leave your ass. After we take everything useful you crammed in your pack.
DLC20000736	Relax, I've humped this load across the Mojave on my own two feet long enough. I can handle it.
DLC20000737	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a virgin on her wedding night up there.
DLC20000738	Last thing I need is some greenhorn getting stuck on a rock, slowing the whole caravan down.
DLC20000739	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
DLC20000740	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a-  well, tighter than a Chairman's fist up there.
DLC20000741	You get stuck in there, you'll slow the whole caravan down while we pry you loose. Begging your pardon, ma'am.
DLC20000742	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
DLC20000743	Why the weight limit?
DLC20000744	You ain't never been to Zion, have you? We'll be passing through a whole mess of narrow slot canyons and high, rough passes.
DLC20000745	A big pack'll get you wedged in like a Super Mutant crawling through a storm drain, and too much weight will kill you in the thin air.
DLC20000746	Actually, let me take care of some more things first.
DLC20000747	Fair enough. Come on back when you're ready.
DLC20000748	Yes, I'm sure.
DLC20000749	Well, all right then. Let's get moving. We've got a long road ahead of us...
DLC20000750	Hang on - ain't you the one that wiped out the Crimson Caravan's Vegas branch not too long ago?
DLC20000751	Ought to thank you for that - knocking McLafferty out of the running gives Happy Trails a market to expand into.
DLC20000752	Wait a minute, I recognize you. Yeah... you're Alice McLafferty's rising star, ain't you?
DLC20000753	You sure you want to be here? McLafferty's non-competes are pretty rigid.
DLC20000754	Damn good thing you came along, too. We had another prospect with a Pip-Boy, but he done skedaddled. Something must've spooked the boy.
DLC20000755	Why are you called Follows-Chalk?
DLC20000756	Our advance scouts leave chalk signs to mark places rich with game. I'm not a full scout yet, so I follow the marks and guide the hunters.
DLC20000757	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20000758	Ask away.
DLC20000759	I want to know more about you.
DLC20000760	What can I tell you?
DLC20000761	I had some other questions.
DLC20000762	Shoot.
DLC20000763	Warlords? How dangerous are they?
DLC20000764	Dangerous enough we won't be going near them if we can help it. I got no desire for my head to decorate some little gas station fort's walls, thanks.
DLC20000765	Degenerate tribes?
DLC20000766	That's right. The folks that lived in Zion before the war, they didn't just get a little savage, they're downright feral.
DLC20000767	Most of them don't even speak English any more - you got to get yourself a New Canaanite translator to talk to them.
DLC20000768	The ones you really got to watch out for are the White Legs, from the Great Salt Lake. They'll attack just about anyone that ain't one of theirs.
DLC20000769	Tell me about the raiders.
DLC20000770	They're about what you'd expect - crazy, jacked up on chems, violent as hell, and not too bright.
DLC20000771	The worst are the 80s, but we won't be passing through their turf on this run.
DLC20000772	You don't know what happened to their mission?
DLC20000773	Nope - hence this caravan. If we don't make contact with the New Canaanites, Happy Trails might as well just shrivel up and die.
DLC20000774	Do you know anything about their religion?
DLC20000775	I ain't a prayin' man myself. They paid for their goods and dealt square with us, that's all I ever cared about.
DLC20000776	But don't think that just because they're religious that they're pacifists. They take care of their own, and they're damn fine marksmen too.
DLC20000777	[SUCCEEDED] You ain't wrong. Losing the Salt Lake City run really stung us. If we can't re-establish contact with this run, we'll be in real trouble.
DLC20000778	It sounds like Happy Trails isn't in the best financial shape.
DLC20000779	[FAILED] We do all right, don't you worry about us. Got enough in the kitty to pay you, anyways.
DLC20000780	So, you guys are totally rich, right?
DLC20000781	Why can't you get to Salt Lake City?
DLC20000782	Without New Canaan's mission in Zion, the only ways to Salt Lake City are down the old I-80 or up through Ogden.
DLC20000783	The highway's too risky - NCR's rangers are so busy here in the Mojave they don't have the manpower to keep the raiders off.
DLC20000784	Ogden's just too far - we'd lose more in travel expenses than we'd ever earn.
DLC20000785	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 75 pounds.
DLC20000786	There's a chest over yonder, you can store your extra in that. It'll be safe as can be until you get back.
DLC20000787	There's a chest over yonder, you can store your extra in that. It'll be safe as can be until you get back.
DLC20000788	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 100 pounds.
DLC20000789	Who is Joshua Graham, and why shouldn't I talk about him?
DLC20000790	Just don't. It makes the New Canaanites powerful uncomfortable, and it scares the britches off the tribals.
DLC20000791	Don't talk about the Burned Man either, while you're at it. Trust me on this one, it's for your own good.
DLC20000792	Tell me more about the job.
DLC20000793	The job is simple - help us get this caravan into Zion and find New Canaan. The pay is 25 caps per day, half up front, half on return.
DLC20000794	You'll get a bonus if we make it into Zion, plus another bonus if we reach New Canaan.
DLC20000795	Oh, one more thing - don't mention the name Joshua Graham to anyone. Anyone.
DLC20000796	How about a game of Caravan to kill some time?
DLC20000797	Should have figured you for a player. All right, let's play.
DLC20000798	Another one, huh? Sure, why not?
DLC20000799	How about another game of Caravan?
DLC20000800	I haven't been through Utah recently - what's the situation like?
DLC20000801	Well, it ain't good, I'll tell you that. It's not like the Mojave or the NCR - hell, even Arizona under Caesar is safer.
DLC20000802	You got raiders all over the damn place, tribes of degenerates that'll eat you as soon as look at you, regional warlords... the works.
DLC20000803	Not too many decent places to stop and trade. New Canaan's one of the only ones left I know about.
DLC20000804	I understand this caravan is headed to Zion. What can you tell me about the area?
DLC20000805	Well, I ain't never been inside, myself. Did some trading with the New Canaanites from their mission there, but that was all on the outskirts.
DLC20000806	All the old ways in and out were destroyed after the War, but we got ourselves the location of a pass the New Canaanites use - that's our way in.
DLC20000807	That's why I wanted someone with a Pip-Boy on the caravan - the map'll be helpful for checking the topography, keeping us on the trail.
DLC20000808	What can you tell me about New Canaan?
DLC20000809	Don't know much about the place, but I can tell you about the people. The New Canaanites were some kind of religious group from before the War.
DLC20000810	They control the old city of Ogden, a ways north of Zion, and they got themselves a nice defensible mission in the canyon itself - or they did.
DLC20000811	They trade a fair bit with the tribes in Zion - well, the ones that don't try and kill them, anyways.
DLC20000812	Tell me about Happy Trails Caravan Company.
DLC20000813	We're a smaller company out of Sac-Town, up in the northern part of the NCR. We run some business through New Reno, there on the "Little Loop."
DLC20000814	Had a nice run to Salt Lake City, too - but then we lost contact with New Canaan, and that went all to hell.
DLC20000815	Heh. All right, I'll believe you - Lord knows I ain't going to pat you down to find out for myself.
DLC20000816	Don't worry about me. I'm used to finding out-of-the-way places to stuff my gear.
DLC20000817	Heh. I do believe you could.
DLC20000818	Not only could I carry my own gear, I could carry yours, his, and one of your brahmins'.
DLC20000819	Who were those tribals who attacked me?
DLC20000820	White Legs - nasty bunch. They been raiding deeper into Zion ever since New Canaan was wiped out.
DLC20000821	Tell me more about Joshua Graham.
DLC20000822	He's been the chief of our tribe since he came back to the Valley. He went off to the civilized world years ago, to fight a war. That didn't go well.
DLC20000823	Why do you need a map of Grand Staircase?
DLC20000824	Grand Staircase is farther east, deeper into the Colorado Plateau.
DLC20000825	The White Legs were able to reach us here, but it's only because Zion is close to the Long 15. They can't pursue us east of here. It's too wild.
DLC20000826	Throughout our history, we have called many places Zion. This valley is full of God's beauty, but it's just a place. Zion is more than this.
DLC20000827	We cannot use any and all means available just to protect stone and water and a piece of sky. We have to hold on to our faith. Far more enduring.
DLC20000828	If we sacrifice grace for a piece of land, we may live in this valley, but we will no longer dwell in Zion. It's better for us to leave now.
DLC20000829	Take all I have.
DLC20000830	Your generosity is...  well, I just can't thank you enough.
DLC20000831	Here's one healing powder.
DLC20000832	Thanks. Even one dose can make a difference.
DLC20000833	Is there any other way I can help the Sorrows?
DLC20000834	If you could part with it, healing powder would be welcome. We have enough Stimpaks for now, but we can't rely on that small supply.
DLC20000835	Broc and Xander plants can be found throughout the valley and you might even find some on White Legs you come across.
DLC20000836	You mentioned you need healing powder. I have some, if you're still interested.
DLC20000837	That's great news. We can use anything you can offer.
DLC20000838	Come on, down this path. We're almost there.
DLC20000839	Holy hell, it's the White Legs! What are they doing this far south?
DLC20000840	Let's end this, then.
DLC20000841	Ha! Yes, end!
DLC20000842	Then see how strong my spears are, warrior.
DLC20000843	This good fight will be!
DLC20000844	Daniel and the Sorrows are weak prey, not fit for such mighty warriors.
DLC20000845	Sorrows are weak. We go, find true warriors to test us!
DLC20000846	I've already crushed your warriors. Retreat now and rebuild your tribe, or die in obscurity.
DLC20000847	...I go. But rebuild my tribe, and come we back stronger than before!
DLC20000848	Well, all of the Bighorners are dead. Problem solved!
DLC20000849	That's... not really what I was hoping for. I guess... I guess at least we don't have to worry about the Bighorners attacking the camp now. Hoy....
DLC20000850	Well, I returned the calf to its herd. Had to kill a few Bighorners to do it, though.
DLC20000851	Sure, hey, I understand. I wish it could have been done different, but at least the calf is back with its herd.
DLC20000852	Well, I returned the calf to its mother, and didn't even kill any of the Bighorners.
DLC20000853	Hoo! Glad to hear it! That'll be some happy mama, huh? Thank you - really. It means a lot to me.
DLC20000854	That sounds like way too much work. Maybe later.
DLC20000855	Oh sure, that's just what the hunters said. Well... I guess let me know if you change your mind.
DLC20000856	All right, I'll look into it.
DLC20000857	That's great! I'll help any way I can.
DLC20000858	Maybe I can help with that.
DLC20000859	Yeah? Hey, thanks - most of the hunters don't listen when I tell them the problem.
DLC20000860	Just one thing - try not to kill any Bighorners if you can, yeah? You'll drive the herd off, and we'll have to range farther on our hunts.
DLC20000861	Tell me a little about this area - any interesting wildlife?
DLC20000862	Mostly it's the mountain Bighorners - whole herd of them up on the cliffs there. Usually they're not too aggressive, but lately... hoo!
DLC20000863	My guess is one of the calves got lost somewhere along the way. Bighorners are communal - one missing calf, and the whole herd gets ornery.
DLC20000864	If that calf doesn't turn up soon, they might very well come down into the valley and attack the camp.
DLC20000865	You change your mind about helping out?
DLC20000866	So, about those Bighorners....
DLC20000867	Mostly it's the mountain Bighorners - whole herd of them up on the cliffs there. Usually they're not too aggressive, but lately... hoo!
DLC20000868	My guess is one of the calves got lost somewhere along the way. Bighorners are communal - one missing calf, and the whole herd gets ornery.
DLC20000869	If that calf doesn't turn up soon, they might very well come down into the valley and attack the camp.
DLC20000870	You might try luring the baby out with some banana yucca. These Bighorners go crazy for the stuff.
DLC20000871	Tell me about the Bighorner problem again.
DLC20000872	I'll do what I can, but I need to defend myself if I'm attacked.
DLC20000873	Of course you do - I understand. You know, I heard stories about rangers from Back When - they carried lightning sticks that stunned the animals.
DLC20000874	I've never been to any of the Back When places, but they might have left one when they died.
DLC20000875	You might also try luring the baby out with some banana yucca - the mountain Bighorners love the stuff.
DLC20000876	What can I do to help?
DLC20000877	I don't have time for this. Go away.
DLC20000878	Lah, I meant no offense - if you won't talk to me, talk to Joshua Graham - he's at our camp on the Eastern Virgin.
DLC20000879	Civilized lands? What do you mean?
DLC20000880	I mean the Lands Beyond the Valley - the place where the cities never fell. Where people don't live in tribes and forage just to survive.
DLC20000881	Joshua keeps saying it isn't paradise out there, but how can it not be, compared to this?
DLC20000882	Sorry, I'm getting distracted - Joshua will want to know about you - please, go to our camp on the Eastern Virgin. Tell him how you came to be here.
DLC20000883	Who is this Joshua?
DLC20000884	Joshua Graham - he leads our tribe. Thanks to him, the Dead Horses are strong, and safe from our enemies.
DLC20000885	He'll want to talk to anyone coming up from south-ways. Guess that means just you, now. Come, I can take you to him.
DLC20000886	Wait, what about Caesar?
DLC20000887	When Joshua first came to us, he was servant to a man he called Caesar. He led his master's armies, and we were ready to follow him into war.
DLC20000888	Then he lost his master's army to a tribe called Enseeyar, the Sunset People. When he returned, he was as you saw him - burned, broken, but changed.
DLC20000889	He led us away from Caesar, led us to our own destiny in Zion.
DLC20000890	Why is it so important that we fight the White Legs?
DLC20000891	Well... because they're our enemies. What else would we do? They take our land, they kill our scouts, they poach our hunting grounds.
DLC20000892	What's with the shell casings in your club?
DLC20000893	We decorate our clubs with them to honor Joshua Graham. They were the weapons of his old tribe, so now they are ours.
DLC20000894	Can't say they seem that dangerous to me, but Joshua says they "won the West."
DLC20000895	What do you know about the New Canaanites?
DLC20000896	Little bit. I met some of their missionaries a few times, but I've never been to their city. Joshua could tell you more - or Daniel, I imagine.
DLC20000897	Do you remember anything about Joshua from before he became your leader?
DLC20000898	Only a little - I was very young. He was... different. Prouder, yes, but harder, crueler, more driven. Really, I was terrified of him. We all were.
DLC20000899	When he came back, I almost didn't believe he was the same man. He was humbler. He wanted to protect, not destroy.
DLC20000900	What did Joshua do for you?
DLC20000901	If it wasn't for Joshua, the Dead Horses would still be the whipping boys of the Zion Valley.
DLC20000902	He taught us how to hold our territory, to protect ourselves. He guided us away from Caesar, and showed us how Caesar would have destroyed us.
DLC20000903	Tell me about your tribe.
DLC20000904	We came up in the Land of the Dead Horse, though why the Back When folks called it that I got no hint.
DLC20000905	We raided, we fought... we lost. Our enemies drove us back into Zion, and we would have died if it hadn't been for Joshua. Joshua, and his Caesar.
DLC20000906	What are all those tattoos?
DLC20000907	Dead Horses mark ourselves to commemorate our hunts. When a hunter takes a great beast, or when a youth goes on his first hunt, he gets a tattoo.
DLC20000908	I see. That's fascinating.
DLC20000909	I'm sure Daniel could tell you more. His knowledge of the Father is greater than my own.
DLC20000910	That doesn't sound like what I've heard about the New Canaanites....
DLC20000911	Perhaps you do not fully understand the New Canaanites. I have seen the Father's images.
DLC20000912	His holy bride and holy son were given unto the world to save it. They dwelt in the caverns of the mountains, caverns which can still be seen today.
DLC20000913	The people sinned against Him, and were punished with the End That Came in Fire and the loss of the holy tongue. Only the New Canaanites were spared.
DLC20000914	Wait, you think the survivalist is... God?
DLC20000915	I do not know this "survivalist," but the Father in the Caves is the god of the New Canaanites.
DLC20000916	I have seen the holy books, and once I even saw an image of the holy child and his mother.
DLC20000917	Do not the New Canaanites' books say the Father gave the world his child?
DLC20000918	Do you have any family?
DLC20000919	I do. A fine husband and three children. I miss them each day, but I take comfort in knowing they are safe.
DLC20000920	Tell me more about your tribe.
DLC20000921	We have dwelt in the Narrows since the End That Came In Fire, when the Father in the Caves punished the world and made us forget the holy tongue.
DLC20000922	We have had good relations with the other tribes in the valley. At least, before Salt-Upon-Wounds brought his White Legs here.
DLC20000923	We have Daniel to thank for our continued existence. His advice and help has kept the White Legs from overrunning us so far.
DLC20000924	I do not know how long even he can protect us, though.
DLC20000925	Who or what is the Father in the Cave?
DLC20000926	Have you not heard of the god of the New Canaanites? He is our protector and our judge. He helped our ancestors find their place here in Zion.
DLC20000927	He gave us many gifts, but we are not to seek him out. His caves are forbidden to us. Those who seek them out are taken from us.
DLC20000928	Give me some info on this Daniel. Who is he?
DLC20000929	Daniel is a wise man, and a great friend to the Sorrows. He taught me to speak the language of New Canaan - the English from the holy books.
DLC20000930	What's your deal?
DLC20000931	Waking Cloud is my name. I am midwife to the Sorrows. It sounds ill-omened, no? "Midwife to sorrows."
DLC20000932	Nothing else. Talk to you later.
DLC20000933	Go with fortune, friend.
DLC20000934	That's all I wanted to know for now.
DLC20000935	Then I will look forward to our next speaking.
DLC20000936	I had other questions.
DLC20000937	Certainly. I am happy to share my knowledge.
DLC20000938	About your husband... I'm afraid he was killed by White Legs during the evacuation.
DLC20000939	What? No... you must be mistaken. Daniel would have told me!
DLC20000940	Safe? Where are they?
DLC20000941	When we learned that Salt-Upon-Wounds had defiled Zion with his presence, Daniel ordered the children, the old, and the sick evacuated from the camp.
DLC20000942	My husband volunteered to lead the hunters that went with them for protection.
DLC20000943	I try not to worry about them, but we have had no news for so long, and Daniel seems sad when I ask him about it. Sad... and a little frightened.
DLC20000944	What do you do when you're not delivering babies?
DLC20000945	I tend to other hurts and sicknesses that afflict our tribe. I also scout the valley for the herbs I use in my medicines.
DLC20000946	Midwife? I haven't seen any children around.
DLC20000947	The children and the old have already been evacuated from the camp. They are safe enough, unless the White Legs come for us in force.
DLC20000948	Have you known him long?
DLC20000949	Six years. He attended the birth of my third child. It was a hard birth. The River nearly carried my water to the Father, and my child's with it.
DLC20000950	Daniel knew the ways of New Canaan's medicine. He stepped in and saved both of our lives.
DLC20000951	After the birth, I asked Daniel if he would teach me what he knew of childbirth. He agreed, and so here I am.
DLC20000952	Holy books?
DLC20000953	Yes - the language of the New Canaanites is the holy tongue, for it is the language their sacred books are written in.
DLC20000954	The Father in the Caves brought it to them after the Judgment, but the ancestors of the Sorrows sinned against Him. They were denied the true tongue.
DLC20000955	You're right. Now, what are you going to do about it?
DLC20000956	About Daniel... I don't yet know. But I am a woman of the Sorrows, and I will have restitution for my husband.
DLC20000957	I agree. It was arrogant and cruel - not exactly the kind of thing a friend would do.
DLC20000958	Arrogant... yes. I thought Daniel respected me, saw the Sorrows as his equals... but he manipulates us for his own ends.
DLC20000959	He was only doing what he thought was best for the tribe. It wasn't an easy choice for him.
DLC20000960	Perhaps... I will have to have a very long talk with Daniel when all of this is over. Thank you for telling me this truth.
DLC20000961	I'm afraid so. Daniel kept it from you because he thought the grief would distract you.
DLC20000962	How... how dare he? What gives him the right? I thought Daniel was my friend, but he cares nothing for the Sorrows!
DLC20000963	Let's talk more later.
DLC20000964	Until then.
DLC20000965	That's all for now, but I'll be back.
DLC20000966	Yeah, reckon you will.
DLC20000967	I understand. I'll respect your beliefs, then, but we need to search the cave.
DLC20000968	I understand. I would prefer to leave as soon as possible, though.
DLC20000969	The Father in the Caves was just a man who lived a long time ago.
DLC20000970	You speak as one who has not heard the tales, who has not seen the sacred images. If you knew, you would not mock.
DLC20000971	Holy wrath. Right. I'll keep an eye out for that. Bet it looks a lot like a bear trap.
DLC20000972	Do not mock that which you do not know! Such talk can only anger the Father.
DLC20000973	I don't have time for your religious superstitions. It's just a cave, that's all.
DLC20000974	It is a holy place! If we go any deeper, we will suffer for it!
DLC20000975	What are you talking about?
DLC20000976	The Father in the Caves! The Holy Father who gave the Sorrows His succor and gave the New Canaanites His son!
DLC20000977	Many of the caves around the valley are sacred to him, and those who would trespass are punished by holy wrath!
DLC20000978	We should not be here! This place... it belongs to the Father in the Caves! We must not profane it with our touch!
DLC20000979	How would we do that?
DLC20000980	Did Daniel not give you some of the New Canaanites' fire clay? That could easily collapse a cave and trap the beasts inside.
DLC20000981	Look around and see if you can find a cave nearby. It may prove easier than slaying the beasts.
DLC20000982	I'll be sure to tell Daniel to bring some bear-monster-thing snacks, then.
DLC20000983	We'd better get to work then.
DLC20000984	I stand with you.
DLC20000985	Big deal, I've killed worse.
DLC20000986	I hope that is truth, and not a boast. But I will respect your leadership.
DLC20000987	What do you propose?
DLC20000988	Fighting so many at once is a dangerous prospect, unless you are a truly mighty warrior.
DLC20000989	This many so close together suggests a nest nearby - if we find it and destroy it, we might have better luck.
DLC20000990	Let's take care of it then.
DLC20000991	As you say.
DLC20000992	These traps must have come from somewhere - I bet the White Legs who placed them are still around.
DLC20000993	I would suspect you are right. Perhaps we should try to find them before they lay more traps?
DLC20000994	What should we do about it?
DLC20000995	Disarm the traps if you can - or find the White Legs who placed them and drive them off.
DLC20000996	Our advance scouts should be able to deal with them if they don't have to fight off raiders at the same time.
DLC20000997	Okay then, let's get down there and take care of business.
DLC20000998	I will follow your command - but I advise caution if it is possible.
DLC20000999	So the totems are sacred to them somehow? Good to know.
DLC20001000	Yes. If their war totems were to... "disappear," they would likely lose the will to fight.
DLC20001001	Any advice on how to deal with the situation?
DLC20001002	You might rush them and take them by surprise. We would be badly outnumbered then, though, and these will be strong fighters.
DLC20001003	We might also use their superstition against them. White Leg warriors believe that to lose their totems on the eve of battle is a terrible omen.
DLC20001004	Yao Guai - even our strongest hunters could not hope to kill so many. There must be a nest nearby.
DLC20001005	This is the only sure path from the Narrows to Pine Creek! They will be cut to ribbons by these traps!
DLC20001006	Those tents down there - that is a White Leg war camp. Do you see the war totems they've erected around the tents?
DLC20001007	White Leg warriors pray to them for strength and savagery before battle. This is no raiding band.
DLC20001008	All right, let's go.
DLC20001009	Goot sists. We head east, then. Joshua is at our tribe's camp in the Eastern Virgin.
DLC20001010	You'd be surprised what "civilized" tribes will fight over.
DLC20001011	Now you sound like Joshua. He always tells me the tribal life is better, that I should stay here and forget the outside world.
DLC20001012	Small? Have you ever seen Hoover Dam? It's bigger than some of these mountains.
DLC20001013	Hah! ...Really? That's... my gods. Must be some mighty civilized folks who built that.
DLC20001014	The only recent war I know of is when Caesar's Legion attacked Hoover Dam. Is that where he fought?
DLC20001015	I don't know, he doesn't talk about it much. Maybe - but how can two civilized tribes fight over something as small as a dam?
DLC20001016	What happened to him?
DLC20001017	Well, before he left, he didn't have those bandages all over his face. That tell you something?
DLC20001018	You see his face, you'll understand.
DLC20001019	Typical. Just when I get a useful minion....
DLC20001020	Hey, it's not my fault! And what's this "minion" stuff? Dahs eet - see you around, "civilized" man.
DLC20001021	Hey, it's not my fault! And what's this "minion" stuff? Dahs eet - see you around, "civilized" woman.
DLC20001022	Give my regards to Joshua, then.
DLC20001023	I will. Goot gonen, ahk iss.
DLC20001024	Are you sure? You've been a useful companion so far.
DLC20001025	Sorry - Joshua was pretty clear. Get you to Daniel, then come on home. You can take it up with him if you'd like.
DLC20001026	No way, pal. I'm not traipsing around the desert with a barbarian who doesn't wear pants.
DLC20001027	I don't think he'll like that answer much. You change your mind, I'll be around the Dead Horses camp. Goot gonen.
DLC20001028	I could use a guide. Let's go.
DLC20001029	Goot! I really wasn't looking forward to talking to Joshua if you turned me down.
DLC20001030	Hey... as long as we're traveling together, think you could help me out with a little wildlife problem?
DLC20001031	Let's move then.
DLC20001032	Who is this Joshua?
DLC20001033	Joshua Graham - he leads our tribe. Thanks to him, the Dead Horses are strong, and safe from our enemies.
DLC20001034	I'm sure he will want to talk to you. You can find him just south of here, in the Angel Cave.
DLC20001035	White Legs? Who are they?
DLC20001036	Nasty bunch of raiders from up by Great Salt Lake. White Legs killed your friends at the Southern Passage.
DLC20001037	Not many survive White Leg raids - not even by running. Joshua will want to hear about what happened to you.
DLC20001038	I had no reason to stay for that fight.
DLC20001039	But... they were White Legs! The enemy! You are a very strange outsider, but I think Joshua will want to speak to you anyways.
DLC20001040	Okay, I'll go talk to him.
DLC20001041	I won't keep you. Maybe we talk again after.
DLC20001042	Hang on, I want to know more about what's going on.
DLC20001043	Joshua will answer all your questions. He doesn't like being kept waiting, though - go talk to him as soon as you can.
DLC20001044	Who are you?
DLC20001045	I'm called Follows-Chalk. Joshua sent me to scout for any outsiders coming up from the Southern Passage.
DLC20001046	We can talk more about that later, though - it's not smart to keep Joshua waiting.
DLC20001047	What is this place?
DLC20001048	This is the eastern fork of the Virgin River, and it's the place we Dead Horses call home. Joshua says it is a temple to God's glory on earth.
DLC20001049	We can talk more about it later, though - it's not smart to keep Joshua waiting.
DLC20001050	Glad you made it. Joshua's just to the south, inside the Angel Cave. You'll want to talk to him straight away.
DLC20001051	All right, people. Been a long couple weeks, but here we are. Zion.
DLC20001052	I know your feet hurt, I know you're tired. But I need everyone's mind on the trail ahead.
DLC20001053	Ain't the trail ahead worries me, Jed. Those descents we made, through that slot canyon back up there.
DLC20001054	Ain't no way we're getting back out the way we come. And then what?
DLC20001055	Goddammit, Stella, heard you the first time, and the fifteenth, too
DLC20001056	The New Canaanites will know a way. And if they don't, we got the maps on our friend's Pip-Boy over there.
DLC20001057	Enough lollygagging! Get moving and keep an eye out for tribals!
DLC20001058	Like I care. Let's just go. I'm ready.
DLC20001059	No objections.
DLC20001060	God's will.
DLC20001061	Let him keep his dignity. Give him a fighting chance.
DLC20001062	He never had any dignity to begin with. None of them did.
DLC20001063	But for your sake... for the Sorrows' sake, I'll let him die on his feet.
DLC20001064	Stand up and look at what's come for you!
DLC20001065	Joshua, you've already won. Look around you. There's no need to kill him.
DLC20001066	[SUCCEEDED] He has a debt to pay for what he's done and I've come to collect. And so he's chosen to cower in the water like a dumb animal.
DLC20001067	Don't listen to this... thing! His cries are those of a mad beast caught in a thicket! He gave no mercy to my family, and I will give none to his.
DLC20001068	We warned you at Syracuse, and you persisted.
DLC20001069	You took advantage of us at New Canaan to drive us out, and like the dogs of Caesar you are, you followed us to Zion.
DLC20001070	And now you stand on holy ground, a temple to God's glory on Earth. But the only use for an animal in our temple is sacrifice!
DLC20001071	Kale watcha nei conserva oh! You understand me, don't you? Don't you?!
DLC20001072	Whatever. Joshua, put a cap in General Gobbledigook here.
DLC20001073	Baika-ker! You devil!
DLC20001074	You're right. We're going to kill you, but not like this. Defend yourself!
DLC20001075	Yoocan no nikumpa me! Deyai-yoo!
DLC20001076	Whoa. This isn't what I signed up for. Let me talk to Joshua about this.
DLC20001077	Him hear you. You talk!
DLC20001078	Let's do it.
DLC20001079	God be with you.
DLC20001080	Thank you for this. I know Daniel doesn't approve, but destroying the White Legs is the only way to ensure the Sorrows can remain in Zion.
DLC20001081	You and I will lead a group of Dead Horse warriors and Sorrows hunters into Three Marys from this position.
DLC20001082	Our objective is to find the White Legs' leader, Salt-Upon-Wounds, and prevent him from fleeing.
DLC20001083	Show no quarter to the White Legs we come across. Make no mistake about why we are here. This is an extermination.
DLC20001084	I prefer to travel alone, thanks.
DLC20001085	The lone Bighorner is the most vulnerable to its enemies. In the herd lies strength - if you reconsider your choice, I will be here. Paz patasooba.
DLC20001086	Sounds good. Let's go.
DLC20001087	Before we depart, our shaman, White Bird, asked me to convey his desire to speak with you.
DLC20001088	Certainly. We should make haste, then.
DLC20001089	Hold up, see that log over there? Take a closer look. There might be some good stuff tucked in there.
DLC20001090	What would you suggest I do instead?
DLC20001091	Hmm... you might try luring the baby out with some banana yucca. These Bighorners go crazy for the stuff.
DLC20001092	What do you know about the White Legs?
DLC20001093	Used to be they raided northeast of Caliente, time to time. But then the Desert Rangers fell apart ten years ago, absorbed into the NCR.
DLC20001094	Soon enough the White Legs were swarming all over that stretch of I-15. Folks learned not to head north if they wanted to keep their scalps.
DLC20001095	Eventually the White Legs destroyed the bridges across the Virgin River, over in Arizona. End of discussion.
DLC20001096	Were the 80s a gang, or a tribe?
DLC20001097	What's the difference? Raiders is raiders.
DLC20001098	Bunch of them swept in to town and dragged off two working girls. Deputies and me gave pursuit, straight into 80s territory.
DLC20001099	By the time we caught up with the girls, there wasn't much left of them. So we turned for home.
DLC20001100	Made it back to Caliente without further losses, but we was watched the whole way. Never seen so few people cover so much land. Goddamn creepy.
DLC20001101	If the 80s had wanted to kill us, we would've been dead. Guess they figured we weren't worth the trouble.
DLC20001102	Tell me about Caliente.
DLC20001103	Place lived up to its name, that's for sure.
DLC20001104	When you got fresh water and a trickle of geothermic power, always be some gang of assholes wants to kill you for it.
DLC20001105	Spent more years and took more bullets than I care to admit protecting that hellhole from dangers, within and without.
DLC20001106	If it wasn't the 80s or the White Legs raiding, it was someone from town drunk off his ass trying to win an argument with a shotgun.
DLC20001107	Got tired of shooting the folks I was supposed to protect. So... now I do this.
DLC20001108	What was that like to grow up in New Reno?
DLC20001109	Imagine New Vegas if there was no Mr. House-type fella keeping the peace, then give everybody a gun and a Jet addiction.
DLC20001110	Town's run by a bunch of crime families, no law to speak of. Make trouble, and you wind up buried in Golgotha, outside town.
DLC20001111	The scuzz factor's off the charts. Non-stop whoring and drugs. Couldn't walk down the street without getting asked to star in a porn movie.
DLC20001112	So I got my ass out of there while I still owned it. Guess I figured the answer to every problem was rule of law. Naive, huh?
DLC20001113	What are you doing here?
DLC20001114	Earning my keep. Jed hired me on as a caravan guard for this expedition of his.
DLC20001115	The work suits me. I've tried staying put in one place, but it never works out.
DLC20001116	Grew up in New Reno, and I couldn't put that snakepit behind me fast enough.
DLC20001117	Then I wound up wasting the prime of my life playing Sheriff in Caliente, little town north on the 93. Talk about a pain in the ass.
DLC20001118	You ask me, best to keep moving. At least the scenery changes.
DLC20001119	Fine. What do you need?
DLC20001120	Sorry, but I'm not going on a scavenger hunt for you.
DLC20001121	The choice is yours, of course, but you're not going to find a way back to the Mojave without our help.
DLC20001122	I'll see what I can do.
DLC20001123	Thank you. Follows-Chalk can help you find your way around the valley.
DLC20001124	He's inexperienced, but he knows enough of our language to ignore the taboos about Pre-War buildings.
DLC20001125	Thank you. Now obviously, taboos against Pre-War buildings won't be a matter for you - but take caution when you go rooting around in them.
DLC20001126	Taboo?
DLC20001127	The Sorrows believe in a spirit that lives in the caves, say the spirit punished them once for trespassing.
DLC20001128	They put special marks around the cave entrances to keep people out. It doesn't work on the White Legs, of course, but the Dead Horses are spooked.
DLC20001129	Why don't you or Daniel do it?
DLC20001130	We are responsible for leading and protecting the Sorrows and Dead Horses. They are smart people, but not as worldly as you or I.
DLC20001131	I am preparing the Dead Horses for war and Daniel is preparing the Sorrows for... other things.
DLC20001132	How about I go find dear Daniel and shake the information out of him?
DLC20001133	There are many reasons why that would be a bad idea. I will illuminate three.
DLC20001134	First, do not believe that because Daniel is a missionary he is incapable of or unwilling to defend himself.
DLC20001135	Second, if you harm Daniel or any of the Sorrows or Dead Horses, I will find you. Make no mistake. God willing, you will not leave this valley.
DLC20001136	Lastly, waging war against good people is bad for the soul. This may not seem important to you now, but it's the most important thing I've said.
DLC20001137	Don't try to get me to help you. I'm not interested.
DLC20001138	There are only so many ways you could have entered Zion from the south. You descended by routes that you cannot safely ascend to return to the Mojave.
DLC20001139	I'm not telling you this as a trick. Whether you want to help us or not, you can't get back without Daniel's assistance.
DLC20001140	I'm sure he'll be willing to assist you, but we have other responsibilities at the moment.
DLC20001141	I'm not going to leave without offering to help. What can I do?
DLC20001142	You're a good neighbor to us. We all go through periods of darkness. In such times, we can turn to the Lord, but it's good to have friends.
DLC20001143	Daniel and I need Pre-War tools to help us navigate beyond Zion. Should we need to evacuate, these instruments will be vital to us.
DLC20001144	Normally, we would have some of the Dead Horses or Sorrows look for them, but many Pre-War buildings in the valley are taboo. They won't go inside.
DLC20001145	Nice guns.
DLC20001146	In the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, all tribes are known for a specific weapon.
DLC20001147	White Legs are known for their big submachine guns, "storm drums." They broke into an armory near Spanish Fork and have been using them for years.
DLC20001148	Of course, the Dead Horses have their wooden war clubs and even the Sorrows have their Yao Guai gauntlets.
DLC20001149	This type of .45 Automatic pistol was designed by one of my tribe almost four hundred years ago. Learning its use is a New Canaanite rite of passage.
DLC20001150	Pray? God? What are you talking about?
DLC20001151	I am a New Canaanite. We believe we are the heirs of a spiritual tradition given to our ancestors thousands of years ago.
DLC20001152	We have made and kept covenants with our Lord, God, to honor his laws. In exchange, we are promised eternal salvation after this life.
DLC20001153	A day will come when our Lord returns to judge us all. Until then, we must honor his laws and start others along the path of salvation if we can.
DLC20001154	That's why we trade with others and work the tribes. We have more than food and medicine to offer. Good news is our most valuable commodity.
DLC20001155	How do I get out of here?
DLC20001156	Even though you made your way in, there's no easy way back. Without a map, you'll die in the wilderness.
DLC20001157	Daniel, one of our missionaries, can help you, but you've caught us at an... inconvenient time. We're under continual threat from the White Legs.
DLC20001158	I came here with the Happy Trails Caravan Company to make contact with the New Canaanites.
DLC20001159	Happy Trails. I remember. They were good friends.
DLC20001160	I have bad news for your employers. New Canaan was destroyed, its citizens scattered. All because of the White Legs. And Caesar, of course.
DLC20001161	The White Legs want to join the Legion. Caesar's rite of passage is the destruction of the New Canaanites, almost assuredly because of me.
DLC20001162	The good news is that we can help you find your way back. Daniel, one of the other New Canaanites, has made many maps of the region.
DLC20001163	The bad news is that we can't help you right now. Not with everything that's going on.
DLC20001164	Well, yeah, okay. You caught me.
DLC20001165	You're lying. You've never been to Vault 22.
DLC20001166	Yeah, so don't bring it up again!
DLC20001167	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
DLC20001168	Well, yeah, okay. You caught me.
DLC20001169	You're lying. You have no idea where Vault 22 is.
DLC20001170	Yeah, so don't bring it up again!
DLC20001171	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
DLC20001172	Carry some of my gear, and I'll keep my mouth shut.
DLC20001173	I travel light on purpose, okay? But fine, I'll tell Jed I'm carrying less so you can carry more. What an asshole.
DLC20001174	What I want is for you to scram. This expedition doesn't need you.
DLC20001175	I'm convincing, you're not. He'll believe me.
DLC20001176	Hey hey hey, why you got to go and be like that! Fuck!
DLC20001177	[SUCCEEDED] Bullshit! Ain't nothing wrong with my Pit-Boy! I mean Pip-Boy!
DLC20001178	Your Pip-Boy isn't working. The screen's locked up, and the reboot button is missing.
DLC20001179	[FAILED] Fat chance! Like I got time to bring you up to speed. Fuck that.
DLC20001180	Any chance you could show me some new ways to use my Pip-Boy?
DLC20001181	Look, this is a sweet gig for me! Don't go fucking it up! What are you after, anyways?
DLC20001182	[SUCCEEDED] Go ahead! Your word against mine, fucko! See what happens!
DLC20001183	I don't think your Pip-Boy works. I'd better go tell Jed.
DLC20001184	[FAILED] Yeah, too bad one of them is worn by a total fucking idiot!
DLC20001185	I guess two Pip-Boys is better than one, anyway.
DLC20001186	Did you notice I'm wearing a Pip-Boy, too?
DLC20001187	Huh? ...Of course I noticed! First thing I noticed about you!
DLC20001188	Me, I'm so used to wearing mine, it's just normal. Don't think you're someone special just because you got one.
DLC20001189	You're lying. I've been to Vault 22. No one's lived there in 150 years.
DLC20001190	You been to Vault two-two, huh?
DLC20001191	I've heard of some strange goings-on at Vault 22. Know any details?
DLC20001192	I know everything! I know all about it! But I ain't about to tell the likes of you!
DLC20001193	I have a sworn vow of secrecy, or something like that, to the people I left behind!
DLC20001194	Where is Vault 22 located?
DLC20001195	I can't tell you that! I have a sworn vow of secrecy, or something like that, to all the people I left behind.
DLC20001196	What do you use your Pip-Boy for?
DLC20001197	Sorry, the shit I do with it is so far over your head, be wasting my time to put it in words you could understand!
DLC20001198	Basically, it makes me badass. More badass, I mean. It's totally mind-blowing shit. It ain't just some bracelet, know what I mean?
DLC20001199	Jed says it's got maps and shit like that, so that's how I'm gonna guide this caravan where it needs to go! Not that I didn't know all that already!
DLC20001200	Where'd you get the Vault suit?
DLC20001201	Where the fuck you think? Vault two-two! That's where I grew up!
DLC20001202	Never mind, I don't want to spend caps on that right now.
DLC20001203	No sweat off my tits, asshole. Guess you better start deciding what gear you're going to leave behind.
DLC20001204	I'll give you 50 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
DLC20001205	You got a deal. You're lucky he trusts me.
DLC20001206	I'll give you 75 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
DLC20001207	You got a deal. You're lucky he trusts me.
DLC20001208	I'll give you 100 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
DLC20001209	You got a deal. You're lucky he trusts me.
DLC20001210	Never mind. It's your problem, not mine.
DLC20001211	Why'd you bring it up, then? When the withdrawal hits and I feel like killing something, I'll know where to start!
DLC20001212	80 caps.
DLC20001213	That much for a dose? Fucking robbery!
DLC20001214	All right, here's your money! Don't spend it all one place!
DLC20001215	Ten hits for 300 caps.
DLC20001216	Ten hits'll last me a good while. Worth every cap. Now fuck off.
DLC20001217	Five hits for 150 caps.
DLC20001218	That'll last me a while! Nice. Now take your caps and fuck off.
DLC20001219	Three hits for 90 caps.
DLC20001220	Three hits? Like that's gonna hold me? Fine, I'll take them.
DLC20001221	Two hits for 60 caps.
DLC20001222	Two hits? Ain't gonna last long. Fine, hand it over.
DLC20001223	One hit for 30 caps.
DLC20001224	One lousy hit? That'll cover me for an hour! Hand it over.
DLC20001225	Yeah, leave now. Before the withdrawal hits you out on the trail, no Psycho for miles.
DLC20001226	Fine! You win, asshole! Enjoy leading the expedition into a fucking ambush! Hope you all die!
DLC20001227	I can sell you a dose of Fixer, but it won't be cheap.
DLC20001228	Fixer? Never said I wanted to kick the habit!
DLC20001229	Guess I can use it when I run out of the good stuff. How much?
DLC20001230	I've got Psycho to sell, but it won't come cheap.
DLC20001231	All right, all right - I am a little light. How many hits you holding?
DLC20001232	How much Psycho you got stashed away? If you run out on the trail... the withdrawal's not pleasant.
DLC20001233	Goddammit, I didn't say nothing about using Psycho!
DLC20001234	But, uh... Just talking hypno-theoretically here... Got any suggestions?
DLC20001235	 for extra gear.
DLC20001236	[FAILED] Ricky travels light on purpose, asshole! If you're looking for a slave, ask someone else!
DLC20001237	Looks like you're traveling light. What would you say to carrying some of my stuff?
DLC20001238	[SUCCEEDED] I travel light on purpose, okay? But if the price is right, I'll tell Jed I'm carrying less - so you can carry more. What's your offer?
DLC20001239	Looks like you're traveling light. Carry some items for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
DLC20001240	Medicine check.
DLC20001241	[SUCCEEDED] Hey hey hey! Fuck you! I didn't say nothing about using Psycho!
DLC20001242	Unwarranted hostility and general agitation. How long have you been a Psycho addict?
DLC20001243	[FAILED] Yeah, Doc, I'm feeling great, fuck you very much. Asshole.
DLC20001244	Are you feeling all right?
DLC20001245	I see you're wearing a Pip-boy and Vault suit.
DLC20001246	Nice job, Eagle Eye! Of course I got a Pit-Boy and a Vault suit! So what?
DLC20001247	Ewww. I think I'll pass.
DLC20001248	I don't think so, honey! You won't be able to resist!
DLC20001249	[SUCCEEDED] Hey! That's - man, what a bitch! I was just being friendly!
DLC20001250	Great, I'll see what I'm shooting at.
DLC20001251	Hey! That's - man, what a bitch! I was just being friendly!
DLC20001252	I'll bring my tweezers and a microscope.
DLC20001253	Do you have any other special skills or abilities?
DLC20001254	Well, I grew up near Dayglow out west, so yeah, I grew a third nut that glows in the dark!
DLC20001255	I'll drop trou for you out on the trail after dark, sis. Let you see what you're working with, know what I mean?
DLC20001256	What a load of crap. The eyeslits of T-series power armor are bullet-proof!
DLC20001257	Then I guess this dumb fucker's armor musta been... D-series or something!
DLC20001258	All I know is, he died up real dead when I killed him, okay?
DLC20001259	[SUCCEEDED] There so is! Or it was a 9mm or a 10, I don't know! Don't care!
DLC20001260	Said I was good at killing shit up! Never said I was good with numbers!
DLC20001261	Too bad there's no such thing as an 11mm submachinegun.
DLC20001262	[FAILED] Whatever. When you're me - a Deadeye - shots like that ain't nothing special. It's just what I do.
DLC20001263	What a shot!
DLC20001264	Please go on. This promises to be entertaining.
DLC20001265	I was walking along, minding my own, and up pops one of them Brotherhoods. He yells "Hand over that laser rifle, asshole!"
DLC20001266	So I hand it over, just to make him think I'm scared! But really I'm not! I never am!
DLC20001267	Before he knows what hit him, I draw my 11mm machinegun and BAM! BAM! Right through the eyeslit in his helmet! D.O.A.!
DLC20001268	You're saying that you killed a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin?
DLC20001269	What's it sound like I'm saying? If I was saying what you said I was saying, then yeah, I said it!
DLC20001270	[SUCCEEDED] No, no, you heard me right. "Deathjaws!" They're like Deathclaws - but bigger teeth!
DLC20001271	"Deathjaws," huh? Did you mean to say "Deathclaws?"
DLC20001272	[FAILED] Just how green are you? Everybody heard of Deathjaws. You better hope I'm around if you run into one.
DLC20001273	"Deathjaws?" I've never heard of those...
DLC20001274	That's quite a story.
DLC20001275	Hell yeah it's quite a story! But I'm quite a man, so stories like that follow me everywhere!
DLC20001276	Or there was the time one of them Steel Brotherhood assholes made the mistake of messing with me! Last mistake he ever made!
DLC20001277	"Deadeye," huh? How did you get that nickname?
DLC20001278	Uh, how you think? I shoot things in the eye, that's how good I am! Yeah, I'm that good!
DLC20001279	Why, uh, once I got jumped by three... Deathjaws! Except actually it was four of them! Imagine that!
DLC20001280	But I didn't panic, because... because I never panic! What I did was become a storm of death! Shot every one of them monsters "pop" in the eye!
DLC20001281	You do anything around here, besides talk too much?
DLC20001282	You want to know what I do, Bud? Anything I fucking want!
DLC20001283	You want to know what I do, Toots? Anything I fucking want!
DLC20001284	You do anything around here, besides make women sick?
DLC20001285	I'm one of a kind! I been places, see? And done things - lots of them!
DLC20001286	And when it's time to kill shit up? Hell yeah, I'm a fucking storm of death!
DLC20001287	Something or someone make the mistake of crossing Ricky? I'll fucking deadeye him, her, or it!
DLC20001288	In fact... yeah, in fact, that's my nickname! "Deadeye" Ricky - that's my name!
DLC20001289	Umm... tell me about this vision quest again?
DLC20001290	You go to cave. Find Ghost of She. Lay ghost to rest. This your quest. Bring peace where was strife. Go!
DLC20001291	Okay then... I guess... I guess I don't have any questions after all.
DLC20001292	Crazy old man. I'm not doing anything for you.
DLC20001293	Spirits guide you whether you listen or not. Smarter to listen, hmm?
DLC20001294	Okay then. I guess I'll just... go then.
DLC20001295	Go! Return maybe yes, return maybe no. But go.
DLC20001296	Wait a minute, what if I don't want to do any of that?
DLC20001297	Let's talk about something else.
DLC20001298	What would you speak of?
DLC20001299	What's with this obsession you seem to have with "civilization?"
DLC20001300	Let me tell you a story. When I was a boy, a man came through the valley with one of the caravans. Tall man, big mustache, carried a guitar.
DLC20001301	I asked what he did for his living, and the interpreter told me he was a singer.
DLC20001302	"What is that?" I asked. The man explained that he went from place to place and sang for people, who gave him food and shelter and care in return.
DLC20001303	I couldn't believe that there was a place in this world where a man could do that. I promised myself then that one day I'd explore that world myself.
DLC20001304	Ya? What did he say?
DLC20001305	I talked to Joshua about your thoughts on civilization.
DLC20001306	For as long as I remember, the Dead Horses have thought that places of the old world were taboo. Doesn't look so spooky to me.
DLC20001307	The Narrows up ahead, that's the Sorrows' territory. They're peaceful enough, but you don't want to make them mad.
DLC20001308	Heads up, this is the Three Marys. White Legs territory. You sure you want to head in there?
DLC20001309	Where do they come from?
DLC20001310	That's the weird part - normally the White Legs keep to the Great Salt Lake. I don't know what brought them down this far south.
DLC20001311	Wait, what? New Canaan was wiped out? How?
DLC20001312	That's what Joshua said. White Legs came down from Great Salt Lake in force - fell on New Canaan before they could mount a defense.
DLC20001313	Joshua found some of the survivors led by a man named Daniel. Most of them have fled the valley, but Daniel stayed on with the Sorrows tribe.
DLC20001314	He and Joshua have been arguing over whether to stand and fight the White Legs or take the Sorrows and the Dead Horses out of the valley.
DLC20001315	You've got a funny idea about what the Mojave's like, but I'll go with you and see your boss.
DLC20001316	Goot sists. Maybe while you're there you can tell me about where you came from, yeah?
DLC20001317	Tell me about Waking Cloud's family.
DLC20001318	What uh... what do you want to know, exactly? I'm sure she could tell you much better than I.
DLC20001319	I ain't feeling good, man. I feel like shit! I got the shakes, got the sweats. This fucking sucks!
DLC20001320	Oh man, yeah! Trigger finger is feeling itch-ay! Come on, assholes! Show yourselves and Deadeye Ricky'll blow your fucking heads off!
DLC20001321	Ah, the Eastern Virgin. What's the phrase? "House sweet house?"
DLC20001322	That's Pine Creek up there. Supposedly it's one of only two ways out of Zion Valley. Of course, without a map, good luck surviving.
DLC20001323	I like your bear glove. Where can I get one?
DLC20001324	A Sorrow's Yao Guai Fist is a sacred symbol. It shows that we belong to the tribe and have willingly undertaken a dangerous quest to aid the tribe.
DLC20001325	Each Sorrow makes his own - and only after hunting and slaying a Yao Guai that threatened our people.
DLC20001326	Our shaman, White Bird, oversees the rites. Perhaps if you spoke to him, he would allow you to undertake such a quest.
DLC20001327	Maybe later, if there's time.
DLC20001328	I do hope you will reconsider. I will point out his cave on your map, should you wish to speak to him later.
DLC20001329	Okay, I'll talk to him.
DLC20001330	Excellent. His cave overlooks the camp - I will show you where.
DLC20001331	Any idea what he wants?
DLC20001332	He did not say. White Bird is notoriously close-lipped. But he is wise, and you would do well to speak to him.
DLC20001333	Wildlife problem? What kind of wildlife?
DLC20001334	All right, let's go.
DLC20001335	Right.
DLC20001336	I'll see you on the other side.
DLC20001337	Go with God, brother.
DLC20001338	Go with God, sister.
DLC20001339	This is taking too long. We can't let Salt-Upon-Wounds escape. I'm going to find a way around. God willing, we will finish this together.
DLC20001340	Maybe later, if there's time.
DLC20001341	As you wish. I will point out his cave on your map, should you wish to speak to him later.
DLC20001342	Okay, I'll talk to him.
DLC20001343	Excellent. His cave overlooks the camp - I will show you where.
DLC20001344	Any idea what he wants?
DLC20001345	He did not say. White Bird is notoriously close-lipped. But he is wise, and you would do well to speak to him.
DLC20001346	Wildlife problem? What kind of wildlife?
DLC20001347	I'll see you on the other side.
DLC20001348	This is taking too long. We can't let Salt-Upon-Wounds escape. I'm going to find a way around. God willing, we will finish this together.
DLC20001349	I could talk to him, maybe he'll open up more to me.
DLC20001350	Perhaps he will. I sometimes feel he thinks he must protect me. If he has news, I would know of it.
DLC20001351	<Lie> Daniel isn't avoiding talking about your family. He's just preoccupied with all of this.
DLC20001352	This is true? You spoke to him? Oh, that is a relief. Grasas, na'ne.
DLC20001353	Follows-Chalk seems like he's interested in seeing more of the world.
DLC20001354	I thought he might. It's been some time since I've visited... civilized places. I don't have fond memories of them.
DLC20001355	But I have always seen these places from the outside. I'd rather not influence him more than I already do. Why don't you talk to him?
DLC20001356	<Lie> That a man must follow his heart no matter where it leads him.
DLC20001357	Really? He said that? Hoo! I'm going to do it. After all this is over, I'm going to go explore civilization!
DLC20001358	Dank ni, ahk iss - I never would have had the growans to ask him myself.
DLC20001359	<Lie> That it's a den of corruption and vice, and the Dead Horses' way of living is better.
DLC20001360	Oh. Well, I guess that's about what I could expect from him. I'd like a minute alone to think about this. Dank ni.
DLC20001361	Really? Maybe I could talk to him about it for you. Be a neutral party.
DLC20001362	You'd do that? Sure, sounds smart to me. He might not get so mad at you.
DLC20001363	What does Joshua think of this?
DLC20001364	I, umm, I haven't told him yet. Never had the growans.
DLC20001365	Enough with the drama. I just want to get home.
DLC20001366	I understand. The safest way for you to resolve this is to help me and the Dead Horses defeat the White Legs.
DLC20001367	Daniel wants to evacuate the Sorrows from the valley. I think this will be much more difficult for everyone, you included.
DLC20001368	You can rationalize, if you'd like. A lucky coincidence of my faith and your pragmatism leading to different goals by the same means.
DLC20001369	But you'll have to help convince Daniel, because I can't do it alone. The good Lord knows I've tried.
DLC20001370	Fair enough. What do you want me to do about it?
DLC20001371	Talk to Daniel about fighting the White Legs. He wants to evacuate the valley, believes it is best for the Sorrows, physically and spiritually.
DLC20001372	He knows I disagree, but believes my desire to fight is the result of my... history of violence.
DLC20001373	Perhaps if he heard an argument from you, he could be convinced. In any case, it's important enough to try.
DLC20001374	I don't know if you've figured this out yet, but I don't believe what you believe.
DLC20001375	Then as a Gentile, you should find this to be even more beneficial. If the Sorrows stay in Zion, you will always have a link to New Canaan.
DLC20001376	If the Sorrows leave Zion, so too do the New Canaanites. What's more, you'll have more White Legs coming farther south.
DLC20001377	You may not be concerned over matters of faith, but this is a case where faith and practicality coincide.
DLC20001378	No one wants the White Legs here. We just need to convince Daniel that it's our responsibility to ensure that doesn't happen.
DLC20001379	Hmm. Okay.
DLC20001380	You're not so certain. Fair enough. We all have doubts.
DLC20001381	Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. But you can be a Thomas for now. Fight the White Legs enough and you'll see the truth.
DLC20001382	I just hope that by the time you understand, there will still be time to convince Daniel that we have to fight for Zion to save it, and the Sorrows.
DLC20001383	Fair enough, I guess.
DLC20001384	I and the Dead Horses are prepared to do what must be done to protect Zion from the White Legs.
DLC20001385	And though Daniel won't accept it yet, there are many Sorrows who are also prepared. They may not be warriors, but this is their home.
DLC20001386	If you have a chance to speak with Daniel about this, ask him to consider defending Zion instead of abandoning it.
DLC20001387	He has good intentions, but I fear that if we evacuate the Sorrows from this place, it will be lost to them, and us, forever.
DLC20001388	I do. They're little more than raiders, if that.
DLC20001389	Then you must bear witness of this revelation to Daniel. The obviousness of it escapes him.
DLC20001390	We both desire a non-violent solution to this problem. Where we differ is that only one of us believes it is possible.
DLC20001391	Speak your heart to Daniel when the opportunity presents itself. There may yet be time to save Zion.
DLC20001392	And what kind of tribe is that?
DLC20001393	God told Moses that the tribes of Cain would not be welcome in Zion. The White Legs are as close as I have seen, beyond hope, beyond redemption.
DLC20001394	But if the Sorrows die in a state of ignorance, their salvation may be delayed as well, passing from life in this world to a spiritual prison.
DLC20001395	We have a responsibilty to protect this place and those who have come to dwell in it. If you feel the same way, speak with Daniel.
DLC20001396	There may yet be time to save Zion from those who are too ignorant to understand what they have come to destroy.
DLC20001397	Yes, what has to be done is you have to get these tribes out of here.
DLC20001398	The Sorrows need help. We brought the White Legs here, the New Canaanites. This is their home, Zion, God's gift to them.
DLC20001399	In abandoning it, we will gain nothing and will lose more than you realize. Please think about this, and look in your heart.
DLC20001400	The light of the mind alone cannot burn away all darkness.
DLC20001401	I need to think about it.
DLC20001402	Of course. Think on it, and look in your heart. The light of the mind alone cannot dispel the whole world's darkness.
DLC20001403	I'll talk to him about it. Maybe he can be persuaded.
DLC20001404	Thank you. It will be for the best.
DLC20001405	You'll get no argument from me. These White Legs are human garbage.
DLC20001406	They're still God's children, but if they turn against their brothers and sisters, won't listen to reason...
DLC20001407	If they pollute the Lord's temples on Earth, like Zion, who are we to stand by and let them continue?
DLC20001408	Daniel does not yet see things the way we do. He is the John to our Matthew and Mark. When you have a moment, speak with him.
DLC20001409	There may still be time to save Zion from the White Legs, to keep God's children here, in this living temple.
DLC20001410	Why are you talking to me about it?
DLC20001411	Daniel and I don't agree on everything, but in our hearts, we both want what's best for the Sorrows and Dead Horses.
DLC20001412	You've seen what the White Legs do, and I think you know what has to be done. If Daniel hears it from someone other than me, well...
DLC20001413	Zion may not be lost to us after all.
DLC20001414	This conversation just got pretty dark. What was that about happy... dashing the little ones?
DLC20001415	Happy are those who do the work of the Lord. Zion belongs to God and the people of God. It is a natural temple and monument to his glory.
DLC20001416	When our Lord entered the temple and found it polluted by money-changers and beasts, did he ask them to leave? Did he cry? Did he simply walk away?
DLC20001417	No. He drove them out. It is one thing to forgive a slap across my cheek, but an insult to the Lord requires... no, it demands correction.
DLC20001418	You don't want to leave Zion. You'd rather kill every last one of the White Legs.
DLC20001419	Given those two choices, yes. In the best of all possible worlds, they would just leave us in peace. But they won't.
DLC20001420	I don't enjoy killing, but when done righteously, it's just a chore, like any other.
DLC20001421	Practiced hands make for short work. And the good Lord knows there's much to be done here.
DLC20001422	No, and I don't really care.
DLC20001423	Living in willful ignorance is an ugly thing, but God often speaks loudest in the wild places of his creation, like Zion.
DLC20001424	Zion is a place, and a state of being, that has been lost to us several times in the past. Each loss is a new fall of man.
DLC20001425	And after each fall, we weep in strange new lands and dream of Zion, dream of visiting vengeance upon those who took it from us.
DLC20001426	But this is the waking world in which we live. There is no need to cry, no need to dream. We can act now and stop the White Legs here.
DLC20001427	Well, I'm guessing you're pretty mad about something.
DLC20001428	The White Legs didn't just force my people out of New Canaan. They butchered everyone who wasn't fast enough to get away.
DLC20001429	The elderly, the ill, children. Those who stopped to help the wounded. It made no difference to them. They can't be reasoned with, the White Legs.
DLC20001430	Daniel believes that if we leave, if the Sorrows leave, the White Legs will stop. He doesn't understand what this kind of tribe is like.
DLC20001431	Are the New Canaanites really a tribe?
DLC20001432	We wear more clothing than them and understand more about technology, but we're still a tribe, a linked family of families.
DLC20001433	The Boneyard, Phoenix, New Vegas, they're just places, metal and stone. New Canaan dies, but the tribe lives on.
DLC20001434	When the walls come tumbling down, when you lose everything you have, you always have family. And your family always has tribe.
DLC20001435	Why haven't I seen any Sorrows in the valley?
DLC20001436	The Sorrows have many skilled hunters among them, but no warriors. They have not had to deal with war or raiders for decades.
DLC20001437	Even though they can hunt a full-grown Yao Guai, they don't know how to deal with the White Legs. That's why we're here.
DLC20001438	Does the valley belong to the Dead Horses?
DLC20001439	The valley belongs to God, but no. The Dead Horses live at Dead Horse Point, up the Colorado River. They came here because I asked them to.
DLC20001440	Before I... returned to the fold, I visited them years earlier. I looked much different then, but I left an impression on them.
DLC20001441	I taught them how to hunt more efficiently, how to maintain their weapons and Pre-War equipment. When I returned, they showed their appreciation.
DLC20001442	Why did the White Legs attack my caravan?
DLC20001443	They attack everyone who isn't a White Leg, especially caravans. They don't know how to survive on their own, so they have to raid.
DLC20001444	But as for why they are here, they are trying to wipe us out. All of us.
DLC20001445	They want to join Caesar's Legion, and they can only prove their worth by destroying the New Canaanites and everyone we shelter.
DLC20001446	Do you ever "fall?"
DLC20001447	Every day. Some days are... harder than others.
DLC20001448	Ha ha ha! Wait... you don't actually believe that, do you?
DLC20001449	I know it may be hard for you to accept or even to understand. In my heart, I believe that though I am a sinner, I have been saved.
DLC20001450	And I believe there is something beyond this rock and this air and this water around us, something more that is waiting for us.
DLC20001451	I have been baptized twice, once in water, once in flame. I will carry the fire of the holy spirit inside until I stand before my Lord for judgment.
DLC20001452	Huh. If you say so.
DLC20001453	Whether there is a God or not, his existence doesn't depend on what you believe or what I say.
DLC20001454	There is much to be skeptical of in this world, so it no longer surprises me to learn how many people don't really believe in anything.
DLC20001455	But I believe that our Lord was made flesh as Jesus Christ and died to redeem me. And you. And the Sorrows. Even the White Legs. Everyone.
DLC20001456	Sounds like a good deal.
DLC20001457	In a world filled with misery and uncertainty, it is a great comfort to know that, in the end, there is light in the darkness.
DLC20001458	Every day, we move closer to our judgment. We must do our best to walk in the footsteps of our Lord and teach others how to do the same.
DLC20001459	For many of us, the road is a difficult one, but the path is always there for us to follow, no matter how many times we may fall.
DLC20001460	What's going on with all of these... tribes?
DLC20001461	A great deal. There are three, make that four, tribes here in Zion. You've already met the White Legs on the way in.
DLC20001462	In this camp, you'll find Dead Horses. In the Narrows, the Sorrows. And finally there's Daniel and myself. We're New Canaanites.
DLC20001463	Do you run the show around here?
DLC20001464	I wouldn't say that. I am the acting war chief for the Dead Horses. They look up to me for such matters, but I only have the authority they give me.
DLC20001465	Daniel is the spiritual leader and main link of the New Canaanites to the Sorrows. He's up in the Narrows right now.
DLC20001466	Let's talk about something else.
DLC20001467	Of course.
DLC20001468	Do they speak... our language?
DLC20001469	Most don't. It's been hundreds of years since the war. They've developed their own languages.
DLC20001470	Take the Dead Horses. We think they were originally refugees from a place called "Res," east of the Grand Canyon.
DLC20001471	They speak a combination of Res and a language spoken by travelers who were visiting Res when the bombs fell. Over time, the two languages blended.
DLC20001472	I was a translator years ago, but it's hard to keep up with all of the tribal variations.
DLC20001473	Thanks for the offer, but I'll handle it myself.
DLC20001474	I don't think so.
DLC20001475	The Divide blocked all of their northern land routes?
DLC20001476	Not all of them. But they couldn't take 127 north to get around the mountains.
DLC20001477	As if Death Valley weren't enough, they had the Divide and Big Empty to deal with.
DLC20001478	From what the Legion's explorers reported, the Big Empty may as well have been a wall to any living thing approaching it.
DLC20001479	What's at the Divide?
DLC20001480	I don't know for certain, and I don't think NCR knows, either. Whatever happened at the Divide was too much for them to handle.
DLC20001481	Our frumentarii told us what they saw. Only fools and madmen would march into a place like that. All roads wind down to the same spot, the grave.
DLC20001482	They said all that's left there is a gaping wound cut into the Earth, cursed and damned. No place for God-fearing folk.
DLC20001483	I'm guessing you don't like Caesar very much.
DLC20001484	Love the sinner, hate the sin. With Caesar, it's often very difficult to see through all of that sin to the person inside.
DLC20001485	I can say that we were both lucky that NCR's supply lines and land routes north of Mojave Outpost were destroyed before the Battle of Hoover Dam.
DLC20001486	Something bad happened near Death Valley, at a place called the Divide. NCR couldn't cut across anymore and it slowed down their reinforcements.
DLC20001487	Terrible storms ripped entire companies apart before they even got to Nevada soil. The aftermath of Hoover Dam could have been even worse for Caesar.
DLC20001488	Do you know about Mr. House?
DLC20001489	I had heard of him, but when we were preparing to enter the Mojave, he didn't seem relevant to what was happening.
DLC20001490	From what I've learned since Hoover Dam, he handled the Mojave tribes in a fashion not entirely dissimilar from Caesar. It's too bad.
DLC20001491	What do you think of NCR?
DLC20001492	Better than Caesar, but that's not a high standard. Too much love of money and ownership, not enough love of God and giving.
DLC20001493	Any society that derives its power and authority from the will of man alone lives apart from God and will crumble in the end.
DLC20001494	What do you know about the war between Caesar and NCR?
DLC20001495	I try not to involve myself with matters of the Mojave anymore. All I know is from before the Battle of Hoover Dam.
DLC20001496	Are you in much pain? Is there anything I can do to help?
DLC20001497	[SUCCEEDED] You are kind to offer, but no, there's nothing you can do. We don't use chems, but I learned long ago that I'm immune to their effects.
DLC20001498	It never stops burning. My skin. Every day, I have to unwind the bandages and replace them with fresh ones.
DLC20001499	Exposing my body to the air is like living through it again. But it's better to be clean than comfortable.
DLC20001500	How did you survive?
DLC20001501	I survived because the fire inside burned brighter than the fire around me. I fell down into that dark chasm, but the flame burned on and on.
DLC20001502	The next morning, I woke up and crawled out of the northern edge of the Grand Canyon, that cursed place. It took me three months to reach New Canaan.
DLC20001503	It was as though the prodigal son had returned. They welcomed me like I had never left, never done anything to shame them.
DLC20001504	The fire that had kept me alive was love. Their love. God's love. I will never be able to repay the debt I owe to them, but I must try.
DLC20001505	How did you end up as Caesar's legate?
DLC20001506	This way lies the path to hell. Edw- Caesar needed me to translate. Translation became giving orders. Giving orders became leading in battle.
DLC20001507	Leading in battle became training, punishing, terrorizing. A series of small mistakes before a great fall.
DLC20001508	And I stayed in that darkness until after Hoover Dam. After I failed Caesar and he had me burned alive, thrown into the Grand Canyon.
DLC20001509	Was one of those men Caesar?
DLC20001510	No, not then. Back then he was just Edward. Smart man. Young, but we all were. We thought we could hike into the Grand Canyon and talk to Blackfoots.
DLC20001511	We did, and the Blackfoots were friendly enough at first, but eventually... I've thought back to that day so many times. I must have mistranslated.
DLC20001512	Something must have been mixed up, because the Blackfoots decided we weren't going to leave. The rest is history, assuming Edward hasn't changed it.
DLC20001513	What are those bandages for?
DLC20001514	[FAILED] For injuries I suffered long ago.
DLC20001515	Were you always with the New Canaanites?
DLC20001516	I was born in Ogden, what people came to call New Canaan. Things were more peaceful when I was growing up.
DLC20001517	When I was a young man, I went out into the world to do missionary work as all New Canaanites do.
DLC20001518	I traveled along the Long 15 and followed 89 south into Arizona. Along the way, I met two men from a group called the Followers of the Apocalypse.
DLC20001519	Edward Sallow and Bill Calhoun. They came to teach the tribes. Calhoun was a good man. Edward was the one who got us into trouble down the road.
DLC20001520	Can I ask you some personal questions?
DLC20001521	Right now, I'd like you to focus on helping Daniel. Maybe there will be time later.
DLC20001522	It's not something I enjoy, but I pray to God that someone may learn from my mistakes. What would you like to know?
DLC20001523	I have a few questions for you.
DLC20001524	Goodbye.
DLC20001525	God be with you.
DLC20001526	Fine, I'll look into getting those supplies for Daniel.
DLC20001527	Do you have anything to trade?
DLC20001528	We do. Though the White Legs destroyed New Canaan, they didn't destroy all of our supply caches.
DLC20001529	All forms of currency are recognized here. Caps, NCR dollars, even Legion coin. Take a look.
DLC20001530	Yes. Take a look.
DLC20001531	Sorry to bother you with reality, ol' Jed. Who cares if we can't get back out the way we come?  That's not a problem.
DLC20001532	 Shhhhh! Hold on, now... Could swear I heard something up ahead.
DLC20001533	I'll take a look, boss! Keep me covered!
DLC20001534	On your feet! Keep fighting! Come on now, I got ya...
DLC20001535	Enough of this! We're sitting ducks here! Here I come! I was a sheriff once, goddamn it!
DLC20001536	Shut the hell up, Ricky! Might as well be waving at them!
DLC20001537	I don't deserve this! My Pip-Boy don't even work! Why the fuck you hire me?
DLC20001538	You want some, assholes? You just pissed off the wrong guy! And that means Ricky!
DLC20001539	Ambush! Tribals, and they mean blood!
DLC20001540	Stella!... Oh no! Don't you die on me, woman, you hear?
DLC20001541	Holy hell! Stay low, people, stay low...
DLC20001542	Goddammit, ambush! Cover, people! Watch yourselves!
DLC20001543	Didn't nobody do this to you but yourself, junkie. Now try suffering in silence for once.
DLC20001544	You ain't got no heart, Stella! I swear, you're a monster, and you're gonna regret treating me like this!
DLC20001545	You ain't sick! You're a goddamn junkie, that's what you are! So shut it!
DLC20001546	You don't know how this feels, Stella! I'm sick! Never been so sick my whole life!
DLC20001547	Enough! Another word of your bitching and I'll put you out of your misery myself!
DLC20001548	Goddammit, never should joined this assbackwards caravan...
DLC20001549	Dream on, Stella. Ricky ain't about to die for nobody. Ricky's fucking in-vin-cible, yessir!
DLC20001550	Sounds like you got enough for a fatal overdose, then. Do us all a favor, will ya?
DLC20001551	Best fix for you'd be a bullet in the brainpan. Now shut it.
DLC20001552	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Johnny-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
DLC20001553	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Janey-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
DLC20001554	Don't worry, Stella! Ol' Ricky won't be running out of Psycho any time soon! Ol' Ricky's downright flush! Yes indeed!
DLC20001555	Shut your mouth, you goddamn junkie! Or I'll plant one between your shoulder blades, I swear!
DLC20001556	"That's right, little lady. Everything will be just fine with Jed to protect you. Quite the leader is what I am, hell yes."
DLC20001557	Oh I'm sure you're right, Jed. What's the worst can happen to us out here? Nothing. Perfectly safe, fucking perfectly...
DLC20001558	"Heard you the fifteenth time, Stella. What's it matter if we're trapped here? Everything will be just fine."
DLC20001559	In the shadow of Daniel's death, those Sorrows who survived the assault on Zion Valley mourned his loss, as was their custom.
DLC20001560	Word of Daniel's passing reached the New Canaanites several weeks later. They prayed that their brother would be well-received by their Lord.
DLC20001561	After leading the Sorrows from their home in Zion to safety in Grand Staircase, Daniel continued to wonder if he'd made the right choice.
DLC20001562	He spent his life evangelizing the beliefs of his people to a new generation of young men and women, as his ancestors had for centuries before him.
DLC20001563	He was happy with his family, but for the rest of his life there were nights when he awoke with sadness to find he had been dreaming of Zion.
DLC20001564	For years after the defeat of the White Legs, Daniel did his best to minister to the Sorrows' spiritual needs.
DLC20001565	Try as he might, he could not hold back the tribe's increasing militancy and reverence of Joshua Graham.
DLC20001566	Demoralized, he returned to his family and Dead Horse Point. His failures haunted him for the rest of his days.
DLC20001567	After a long and troubled life, Joshua Graham finally found rest in Zion.
DLC20001568	In the end, his unswerving militancy had accomplished what the NCR's finest sharpshooters and Caesar's wrath could not.
DLC20001569	The New Canaanites took comfort in the belief that their brother's soul would again dwell in Zion at the end of days.
DLC20001570	The threat of the White Legs ended, Joshua Graham helped the Sorrows and Dead Horses tend to their fallen comrades and secure Zion.
DLC20001571	The Courier's words had stayed Joshua's wrath in his darkest hour, and in sparing Salt-Upon-Wounds, he was changed.
DLC20001572	While he continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan, he sometimes showed quarter to those who crossed his family.
DLC20001573	Eventually this new spirit would diminish the myth of the Burned Man in distant lands - a small price for the peace it brought to Joshua Graham.
DLC20001574	With the White Legs crushed, Joshua Graham led the Sorrows and Dead Horses in tearing apart and burning the corpses of their enemies.
DLC20001575	He set about training his army in the "Way of the Canaanite," and soon the New Canaanites and tribes of Zion were feared well into the Mojave.
DLC20001576	Legends of the Burned Man grew even more depraved, and terrifying.
DLC20001577	Though the Courier had stopped Joshua Graham from executing Salt-Upon-Wounds, the war chief still fell in battle.
DLC20001578	The White Legs defeated at Three Marys, Joshua led the Sorrows and Dead Horses in tending to their comrades and burning the corpses of their foes.
DLC20001579	He continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan and showed little quarter to those he fought. And yet he was changed.
DLC20001580	He no longer reveled in the brutality and cruelty for which he had been known in his former life.
DLC20001581	His inner demons, if not extinguished, were at the least... appeased.
DLC20001582	Waking Cloud turned bitter and resentful toward Daniel and the New Canaanites when she learned her husband's death had been concealed from her.
DLC20001583	She poisoned some of her tribe against New Canaanite teachings, making relations between the groups difficult from time to time.
DLC20001584	Waking Cloud was distraught when she learned of her husband's death, but took comfort from her tribe, and the compassion of the New Canaanites.
DLC20001585	She forgave Daniel for having concealed her husband's fate from her, and learned to accept his fate.
DLC20001586	When her grief faded, she took a husband from the Dead Horse tribe. At her bidding, he stayed close to home.
DLC20001587	Follows-Chalk took the Courier's words to heart and decided that the big cities of the Mojave Wasteland and NCR were best left unexplored.
DLC20001588	Though he sometimes dreamed of distant lands, he continued to support his family at Dead Horse Point, and eventually his wanderlust faded.
DLC20001589	Follows-Chalk took the Courier's words to heart and decided that he would behold the sights and sounds of distant lands with his own eyes and ears.
DLC20001590	After returning to Dead Horse Point, he quarreled with his family and other tribe members about his ambitions.
DLC20001591	One morning, they awoke to discover that Follows-Chalk had set off alone, westward, into the wilderness.
DLC20001592	He was never seen again.
DLC20001593	Already weakened by several seasons of bad trading, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was devastated by the failure of its expedition.
DLC20001594	The New Canaanites never reestablished ties with the caravan.
DLC20001595	Their experiences with outsiders near the Great Salt Lake and in Zion had been far too negative.
DLC20001596	Within six months, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was bankrupted and dissolved.
DLC20001597	Already weakened by several seasons of bad trading, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was initially discouraged by the results of its expedition.
DLC20001598	The fate of New Canaan, and the evacuation of the Sorrows from Zion, made the prospect of trading seem fruitless.
DLC20001599	When Daniel told his family about the exploits of Happy Trails' employee, the Courier, however, New Canaan decided to repay the company's kindness.
DLC20001600	Twice per year, New Canaanites made the dangerous journey west to trade with the company in the city of New Reno.
DLC20001601	The Happy Trails Caravan Company could not survive on such trading alone, but the New Canaanite's generosity made tough times go easier.
DLC20001602	The defeat of the White Legs in Zion marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Happy Trails Caravan Company.
DLC20001603	Every two months, the caravan met with the New Canaanites in Zion Valley to trade. Happy Trails soon returned to prosperity.
DLC20001604	The vigilance of the Sorrows and Dead Horses in defending southwestern Utah, initially startling to Happy Trails caravans, soon proved a blessing.
DLC20001605	The tribes united against the 80s, driving them back from Highway 50, and thus opening yet another trading route for Happy Trails caravans.
DLC20001606	Having revered Joshua Graham as a living legend for so many years, the Dead Horses found it difficult to accept his death.
DLC20001607	New Canaanite missionaries sought to remain in contact with the tribe, but lacking Joshua's authority, their influence dwindled.
DLC20001608	Still, as an expression of enduring respect for their lost spiritual leader, the Dead Horses helped protect the lands where New Canaanites settled.
DLC20001609	As generations passed, the Dead Horses came to worship a spirit of the land, a harsh spirit of divine justice. They called it Joshua.
DLC20001610	Having helped Daniel and the Sorrows escape from Zion, the Dead Horses returned to their home at Dead Horse Point.
DLC20001611	The tribe continued to learn from the New Canaanites, and over many years built a flourishing community along the banks of the Colorado.
DLC20001612	Though the tribes' bond would endure, it was Joshua Graham's legend the Dead Horses would revere, not the tenets of New Canaan's faith.
DLC20001613	Having helped eradicate the White Legs from Zion, the Dead Horses returned to Dead Horse Point in triumph.
DLC20001614	They remained neutral toward the Sorrows, but as years went on, there were periods of competitive friction, even violence, between the tribes.
DLC20001615	The New Canaanites - Daniel especially - intervened regularly as mediators, but found it difficult to reconcile the tribes' conflicts.
DLC20001616	Daniel succeeded in leading the Sorrows out of Zion, as he had wanted to do from the start.
DLC20001617	The Courier protected the Sorrows during the evacuation, ensuring that most reached their destination unharmed.
DLC20001618	Over the weeks and months to come, Daniel would see to the Sorrows' resettlement in Grand Staircase.
DLC20001619	Their adjustment to their new home was not without difficulty, but eventually the Sorrows came to accept the loss of Zion.
DLC20001620	Daniel evacuated the Sorrows from Zion, but due to the Courier's neglect, the White Legs butchered many along the way.
DLC20001621	Those who survived barely reached Grand Staircase, but once there, the Dead Horses and New Canaanites helped them settle.
DLC20001622	The unfamiliarity of their new surroundings, and the loss of loved ones, evoked a terrible and lasting grief among the Sorrows.
DLC20001623	For two generations, many would die still lamenting the loss of Zion.
DLC20001624	The Sorrows fought beside Joshua Graham and the Dead Horses, eradicating the threat the White Legs posed to Zion.
DLC20001625	Seeing the Courier convince Joshua Graham to spare Salt-Upon-Wounds, the Sorrows learned that retribution could be tempered by mercy.
DLC20001626	Though he despaired at the Sorrows' loss of innocence, Daniel took some small consolation in the Courier's lesson, and prayed it would take root.
DLC20001627	The Sorrows fought beside Joshua Graham and the Dead Horses, eradicating the threat the White Legs posed to Zion.
DLC20001628	Watching as the Courier encouraged Joshua Graham to execute Salt-Upon-Wounds, the Sorrows learned that New Canaan offered no mercy to the wicked.
DLC20001629	The Sorrows' transformation from a peaceful, timid tribe into a merciless, warlike people broke Daniel's heart.
DLC20001630	Over time, the Sorrows became ever more ruthless in their dealings - even with each other.
DLC20001631	Daniel traveled to and fro between the New Canaanites and Zion, continuing to plead for a return to the old ways whenever he visited.
DLC20001632	Eventually, the Sorrows grew tired of his blather, and turned their backs on him.
DLC20001633	The Sorrows fought beside Joshua Graham and the Dead Horses, eradicating the threat the White Legs posed to Zion.
DLC20001634	When the Courier and Joshua Graham felled Salt-Upon-Wounds, their victory was celebrated with a great feast.
DLC20001635	The Sorrows' transformation from a peaceful, timid tribe into a proud and warlike people broke Daniel's heart.
DLC20001636	He tried to take solace in the knowledge that they would remain in Zion, but it was a small comfort. The Sorrows' innocence was lost.
DLC20001637	With Daniel dead, the White Legs soon overran Zion and drove the Sorrows and Dead Horses from the Valley.
DLC20001638	The White Legs plundered all of the Pre-War buildings the Sorrows had marked off-limits, their squalor an affront to Zion's natural beauty.
DLC20001639	By year's end, little trace remained that the Sorrows had ever made the valley their home.
DLC20001640	After the White Legs drove the Sorrows from Zion, they celebrated by destroying all traces of the valley's former inhabitants.
DLC20001641	They appealed to the Legion for assimilation, but were denied.
DLC20001642	Their failure to eradicate the New Canaanites in Grand Staircase and farther up the Colorado had not gone unnoticed.
DLC20001643	The White Legs made a half-hearted effort to find the New Canaanites, but were driven off by Dead Horses trained in the ways of Joshua Graham.
DLC20001644	The White Legs lost all hope of joining the Legion and disintegrated into a number of petty raiding bands, leaving Zion Valley a polluted cistern.
DLC20001645	Demoralized by the Dead Horse and Sorrows attack the Courier and Joshua Graham led against them, the White Legs retreated to Great Salt Lake.
DLC20001646	Their days were numbered. Word soon reached the 80s tribe that the White Legs' spirit was broken, their war chief a dim shadow of his former self.
DLC20001647	By year's end, the 80s would overrun the White Legs' camps, scattering the tribe to the winds and claiming the Great Salt Lake for its own.
DLC20001648	Joshua Graham's chilling execution of Salt-Upon-Wounds seared into their minds, the surviving White Legs retreated to the Great Salt Lake.
DLC20001649	Unable to shake the memory of their brutal defeat and the Dead Horses' savagery in battle, the White Legs feared further reprisals.
DLC20001650	They fled north, out of Utah, into Wyoming. The wilderness was harsh, and the first winter claimed over half the tribe.
DLC20001651	When spring came, the survivors parted ways in small bands. And so the White Legs died a quiet, ignominious death.
DLC20001652	Despite their defeat at Three Marys, and the death of their war chief, the White Legs were determined to pursue the other New Canaanites.
DLC20001653	But when they finally tracked down their prey in Colorado, they discovered the tables had been turned.
DLC20001654	The White Legs who survived the New Canaanites' ambushes were hunted down by Dead Horses before they could reach the safety of the Great Salt Lake.
DLC20001655	When word of the White Legs' diminished numbers reached the 80s tribe, war was declared, and by year's end, the White Legs had been wiped out.
DLC20001656	And with that, the Courier walked out of the history of the tribes of Zion and back to the gathering storm of the Mojave Wasteland.
DLC20001657	And so it was that the conflict between the New Canaanites and the White Legs was finally resolved.
DLC20001658	The Courier's involvement had tipped the scale, shifting the fragile balance of power.
DLC20001659	Never mind. Keep living the dream.
DLC20001660	That's right. Stick your nose where it don't belong and it's gonna get stung.
DLC20001661	I had to kill the Bighorners, but I saved the little one.
DLC20001662	That's... not really what I was hoping for, but... I guess I can give the little guy a home. What the hell.
DLC20001663	Come on. I got you everything you needed. Just give me the damned map.
DLC20001664	Okay. You better listen close because I'm not going to repeat myself. You were not invited here. This is not your home.
DLC20001665	We have what you might call a compulsion to help you on account of our beliefs, but if you continue to spit in our eye with insults and profanity...
DLC20001666	You'll find out what happens when our patience wears out. People died at New Canaan because we bickered and debated about what to do.
DLC20001667	That was a mistake. Complaining to me now, also a mistake. I'm not going to add sin upon sin by listening to your grumbling.
DLC20001668	You want the map? Get out in that valley. Help us. One of the Sorrows, Waking Cloud, will go with you. She knows how to get around the valley unseen.
DLC20001669	She's also a midwife and has three kids of her own, so she'll be more tolerant of your whining.
DLC20001670	If it will get me out of here, sure.
DLC20001671	Listen, I understand that you want to go home. But we didn't ask you to come to Zion. As far as I'm concerned, you're an uninvited guest.
DLC20001672	In better times, I'd drop everything to help you out, but I have to ensure the safety of the Sorrows first.
DLC20001673	And don't think you're alone in this. One of the Sorrows, Waking Cloud, has volunteered to help you in the valley.
DLC20001674	She's an experienced hunter and has a special gift for staying out of sight when she needs to. Should make things easier for you.
DLC20001675	After that, all that's left is to evacuate the Sorrows safe and sound. I'll give you a map and supplies, everything you need to get back home.
DLC20001676	Anything to help. I'll do what I can.
DLC20001677	I appreciate the enthusiasm. There aren't a lot of people in the wasteland with kindness to spare for anyone who isn't kin.
DLC20001678	Since you've been poking around the valley, you might see more activity from the White Legs.
DLC20001679	One of the Sorrows hunters, Waking Cloud, has volunteered to help guide you through the valley. She has a special talent for staying out of sight.
DLC20001680	After this, it's just a matter of getting everyone out of here safe and sound. And hopefully you can head back to the Mojave without any more trouble.
DLC20001681	Who are you to be asking me questions?
DLC20001682	I'm someone who's responsible for protecting a lot of innocent people from raiders and mercenaries who might try to take advantage of them.
DLC20001683	I think you need a little perspective on what the heck is going on in Zion. There's a Dead Horse warrior camp at Eastern Virgin. Get there.
DLC20001684	My friend Joshua Graham can fill you in on some of the trouble we've been having with White Legs in these parts. Listen to what he says.
DLC20001685	Now if you'll excuse me, I've had enough of your sass for one day.
DLC20001686	Oh, heh. I just walked here. No big deal.
DLC20001687	Okay. Can you do me a favor and "just walk" down to Eastern Virgin?
DLC20001688	There's a group of Dead Horse warriors there with my colleague, Joshua Graham. I'd like you to talk to him about the route you took to enter Zion.
DLC20001689	We've had a lot of problems with White Legs in the area and I'd feel more comfortable if you spoke with him about the situation here. Thanks.
DLC20001690	I came in with the Happy Trails Caravan. We were attacked by tribals. I'm the only survivor.
DLC20001691	That's... I'm so sorry. That's terrible. We've been having a lot of problems with the White Legs here in Zion lately.
DLC20001692	In fact, that's why I'm here. I'm Daniel, a New Canaanite missionary to this tribe, the Sorrows.
DLC20001693	It's important that you speak to my colleague, Joshua Graham, at the Dead Horses camp at Eastern Virgin. We can speak again later.
DLC20001694	Again, I'm very sorry for the deaths of your friends.
DLC20001695	Joshua's a New Canaanite and he's obviously willing to attack the White Legs.
DLC20001696	Joshua is a living bible of all mankind's miseries of war! The debt he has levied through his actions, he repays every day!
DLC20001697	He is a monument both to God's unending forgiveness and to humanity's unfathomable capacity for cruelty. It's written on every inch of his body!
DLC20001698	When you look at him, do you only see a man of God? Beneath those bandages, he is burned flesh. As he burns, so does he consume everyone around him.
DLC20001699	Joshua wants to fight because the White Legs have stoked the naked flame inside of him. You, you see the light, but do not yet feel the heat.
DLC20001700	I can pray that you never will, but it isn't up to me and it isn't up to God. It's up to Joshua.
DLC20001701	If you're willing to defend the Sorrows, why not pursue the White Legs?
DLC20001702	There is an important difference between killing in defense and waging war. Even a Gentile like you should know that.
DLC20001703	You're right to leave, but I don't think you should kill any of the White Legs.
DLC20001704	You're free to hold that opinion, but you're not responsible for these people. If I have to kill to prevent their blood from being spilled, so be it.
DLC20001705	That's an awful lot of responsibility to take on.
DLC20001706	The New Canaanites interfered in their lives. We did that. And we've done it before, with others. Always with good intentions, but things go wrong.
DLC20001707	When that happens, we can't just abandon them, let them die at the hands of New Canaan's enemies.
DLC20001708	Why are you so eager to evacuate Zion? You don't seem to be a pacifist.
DLC20001709	There's an old saying that goes, "If you want peace, get ready for war."
DLC20001710	You've got me figured half-right. I'll shoot dead any White Leg that tries to creep into this camp, but it's only to protect the Sorrows.
DLC20001711	The Lord helps those who help themselves, but the Sorrows don't know how. Joshua and I do. Since I got them into this mess, I need to get them out.
DLC20001712	I'll be taking the map now.
DLC20001713	You just don't learn, do you?
DLC20001714	Fine.
DLC20001715	Fantastic.
DLC20001716	Sorry, I uh... didn't mean to insult you or whatever.
DLC20001717	[FAILED] Corrected action is the most sincere form of apology.
DLC20001718	I apologize, Daniel. I think stress got the best of me.
DLC20001719	[SUCCEEDED] I understand. But I hope you can understand why it's so important for us to leave here as soon as we can.
DLC20001720	I... we couldn't save New Canaan. This is a chance to make up for that, to start again. We can't fail.
DLC20001721	I understand.
DLC20001722	Thank you. If I can help you in some other way, don't hesitate to ask.
DLC20001723	Yeah, but I'm helping you so... come on.
DLC20001724	[FAILED] If you need healing, just ask me. I can help you with addiction, radiation poisoning, even broken bones. But I can't give you supplies.
DLC20001725	Most of the Sorrows and Dead Horses are protected. I'm out there getting shot up by White Legs.
DLC20001726	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. Just be careful and hopefully you won't need these.
DLC20001727	But I have... caps. Many of them. Let me show you all of my fine caps.
DLC20001728	[FAILED] I'm sure your caps are fine, but I have to hold on to the supplies I have here. Sorry.
DLC20001729	I'm trading Pre-War goods and supplies from the Mojave Wasteland. You need those too, don't you?
DLC20001730	[SUCCEEDED] I do. All right. I can provide you with supplies, but be frugal with them.
DLC20001731	I don't quite have 300 caps.
DLC20001732	Here's 300 caps to cover the expenses.
DLC20001733	That should cover it. Hold on. This shouldn't take long.
DLC20001734	Er... it looks like I don't quite have 600 caps.
DLC20001735	Well, I do need to cover the cost of supplies. Let me know if you find enough funds.
DLC20001736	It looks like I'm a bit short of 300 caps...
DLC20001737	Well, I do need to cover the cost of supplies. Let me know if you find enough funds.
DLC20001738	Actually, I think I'll be fine. Thanks anyway.
DLC20001739	Suit yourself.
DLC20001740	I guess I don't quite have 150 caps...
DLC20001741	Well, I do need to cover the cost of supplies. Let me know if you find enough funds.
DLC20001742	I can handle the expenses. 600 caps should cover everything, shouldn't it?
DLC20001743	Thanks. Hold still. You'll be better in no time.
DLC20001744	Sure. Will 300 caps cover it?
DLC20001745	Thanks. Hold still. You'll be better in no time.
DLC20001746	Here's 150 caps for the trouble.
DLC20001747	Thanks. Hold still. You'll be better in no time.
DLC20001748	Hmm. I guess I don't have 200 caps.
DLC20001749	I'd like to help you, but I have to be able to cover the cost of supplies. If you can find the money, come back and see me.
DLC20001750	Yes. Here's 200 caps.
DLC20001751	Have a seat. This may be a bit uncomfortable.
DLC20001752	I need medical supplies.
DLC20001753	I can provide medical assistance. I can even use supplies that we have here, but I can't just sell what we have.
DLC20001754	I need to address problems as they arise, and most of those have to do with the Sorrows or Dead Horses.
DLC20001755	Take a look.
DLC20001756	Radiation sickness.
DLC20001757	Even after all these years, it's still a problem for prospectors, caravan guards, couriers, and tribals. I can fix it.
DLC20001758	Oh, the usual. A few scrapes, burns, and bullet wounds.
DLC20001759	Huh. You look fine to me. Physically, anyway.
DLC20001760	Yeah, you don't look too bad. Shouldn't take much to get you fixed up.
DLC20001761	It looks like you have a few nasty injuries, but nothing I haven't seen before. Want me to fix you up?
DLC20001762	Funny sense of humor. I've seen corpses with injuries less severe than yours. This might take a while.
DLC20001763	I have an addiction problem.
DLC20001764	As much as I wish people wouldn't touch alcohol or chems at all, I understand. Would you like me to help?
DLC20001765	I need some medical assistance. Can you help?
DLC20001766	I should be able to address most common problems. What's the matter?
DLC20001767	Fine. Forget it.
DLC20001768	Good.
DLC20001769	That's too bad, because I'm going to tell her.
DLC20001770	You'll do what you'll do - I won't try to stop you. I'd ask only that you consider the repercussions of your actions.
DLC20001771	Aren't you the guy in charge around here?
DLC20001772	That's not an easy thing to be. I don't like doing this, but I can't see any good coming from telling Waking Cloud her husband died.
DLC20001773	You're the New Canaanite who's supposed help lead these people, not hide things from them.
DLC20001774	I know. You're right. I shouldn't have hidden it from her in the first place. I just... we can't fail here again.
DLC20001775	Zion can't become the next New Canaan. The Sorrows don't deserve that. They don't deserve any of this.
DLC20001776	Sometimes I look at them and wonder if they would have been better off if those old trails had stayed forgotten.
DLC20001777	If we had never found any of them. Tell Waking Cloud if you think that's best. I won't stop you.
DLC20001778	Settle down. I'm not telling her squat.
DLC20001779	Good. I'll tell her after we've helped the rest of the Sorrows reach safety.
DLC20001780	I don't think you should hide this from her, but I see your point. I won't say anything.
DLC20001781	And I don't like hiding it from her, but I'm between a rock and a hard place here.
DLC20001782	Her people... honestly, we all need her help. As much as it pains me to say it, there will be time to mourn later.
DLC20001783	It's her husband! Don't you think she has a right to know?
DLC20001784	To every thing, there is a season. Who are you or I to put this heavy burden on her now?
DLC20001785	O... kay, let's talk about something else then.
DLC20001786	Good. Fine, whatever you'd like to know.
DLC20001787	What's the matter? Did something happen?
DLC20001788	Her three children are safe. They made it north weeks ago and met up with New Canaanites heading east.
DLC20001789	Her husband didn't make it. He died protecting their children from a White Leg attack.
DLC20001790	Do not tell Waking Cloud. She is one of the only Sorrows who can communicate easily with us and her tribe needs her to be strong right now.
DLC20001791	Did you help the rest of her family leave Zion?
DLC20001792	I did.
DLC20001793	She said one of her births was difficult and you helped her through it.
DLC20001794	Oh, well that's true. Waking Cloud is a talented midwife. She's certainly brought more children into the world than I have.
DLC20001795	But there are some problems she's never dealt with. One of them came up when she was having her third child and...
DLC20001796	I really didn't do much. I'm surprised she mentioned it.
DLC20001797	The use of violence only leads to more violence.
DLC20001798	Try walking alongside a tribal child, a refugee, and holding her hand for three days because her parents were killed by NCR prospectors.
DLC20001799	After the prospectors have stalked the remainder of the tribe, they fire off a few shots to scare them, and the tribe bunches together for safety.
DLC20001800	A grenade comes rolling in and kills another six people. The only reason you survive is because someone else's body absorbed the shrapnel.
DLC20001801	You're left sprawled out on the ground with ringing in your ears and a little girl's hand in your hand because that's all that's left of her.
DLC20001802	After you've done that, if you can look me in the eye and tell me it's better to stand aside, maybe then I'll listen to you.
DLC20001803	That makes sense. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20001804	What would you like to know?
DLC20001805	Joshua's come up with a reasonable alternative. Why not help them fight?
DLC20001806	Joshua doesn't just want to fight the White Legs. He wants to annihilate them. The stakes are too high for their tribe.
DLC20001807	Hurting them won't dissuade them. If they can't join Caesar's Legion, they'll die out in a generation. They've never learned how to survive.
DLC20001808	Food preservation, tanning, even basic hunting and cooking seem beyond them. They only survive by scavenging and raiding, but that can't last.
DLC20001809	They'll only stop if Joshua and the Dead Horses can kill their war chief and their entire war band. That's exactly what he intends to do.
DLC20001810	This is the way the world is. They're part of it, whether you like it or not.
DLC20001811	No. This is how we made the world. And we brought it to them.
DLC20001812	Joshua must be waiting for you. I'll stay here with the others.
DLC20001813	And you have the right to pull them off of their land?
DLC20001814	I've already explained to them that we're leaving! They've accepted it! What is Joshua going to tell them about being a warrior?
DLC20001815	What are you going to tell them about how to live with themselves after they got lost in the moment, killed someone who didn't deserve to die?
DLC20001816	Or does that not matter? Is that just an acceptable consquence if it means holding on to this valley?
DLC20001817	Maybe there is no place left in this world for mercy. But even if it tramples me into the dust, I will never accept it. And I will never condone it.
DLC20001818	Joshua must be waiting for you. I'll stay here with the others as I told them I would.
DLC20001819	Let's talk about something else.
DLC20001820	Of course.
DLC20001821	Why won't you tell me about what happened at New Canaan?
DLC20001822	It's not a subject I'm fond of discussing. It's over and done with, anyway. Why are you so interested?
DLC20001823	I'd like to talk to you about Mordecai.
DLC20001824	I'd like you to drop it. It's a private matter.
DLC20001825	I understand. Let's talk about something else.
DLC20001826	Thanks. What would you like to know?
DLC20001827	I'm just curious, that's all.
DLC20001828	[FAILED] It's understandable, but this is something for me to work out with the Lord. And I hope you can understand that.
DLC20001829	You're the man in charge. If something's troubling you, it could affect all of us.
DLC20001830	[SUCCEEDED] I never thought I'd be in charge of anything. Don't know why. Bishop Mordecai was old. He had been sick for years.
DLC20001831	He couldn't walk anymore. It wasn't a problem for the rest of us. He made it out to be more trouble than it really was. Just his way, I guess.
DLC20001832	When the White Legs came... he was upstairs. We couldn't get him out in time. The house caught fire at the base and worked its way up. Fast.
DLC20001833	He didn't die of smoke. I wish he had. Sometimes I wake up and for a minute or two, I think all of it was a dream. But it's not. It wasn't.
DLC20001834	I wish all of this were some fevered vision of what could have been. Instead of what is, what we let happen.
DLC20001835	Why don't you teach them something useful instead of filling their heads with nonsense?
DLC20001836	We teach them practical skills for this life and we prepare them for what's to come.
DLC20001837	The Sorrows could master all the wonders of the Old World. conquer the Great Basin north to south. But without God's love, they would have nothing.
DLC20001838	It is shelter in the storm, food in times of hunger, warmth and light in the cold and darkness. What can compare to that in value and versatility?
DLC20001839	You don't agree. That's your choice. It can be their choice, too. No one is forced to follow the narrow path.
DLC20001840	Sounds kind of far-fetched, even for the wasteland.
DLC20001841	Good news is an amazing thing in this world we've unmade. We're so used to going to sleep with nightmares that we can't imagine waking up to a dream.
DLC20001842	But that's what we believe, every word of it. It's the cornerstone of our faith and how we choose to live.
DLC20001843	With every step you take, you put one foot in front of the other and know that you'll be pulled back down to this Earth.
DLC20001844	We know that God is watching over us, waiting for us to come back home. To us, there's no difference. Walking and living. It's all belief, all faith.
DLC20001845	Interesting.
DLC20001846	Heh. That's actually a better response than I usually get from wastelanders. No offense.
DLC20001847	Tell you what. There's a lot going on right now but why don't you take this. Read it. Maybe you'll hate it. Maybe you'll be bored.
DLC20001848	But if you have questions, assuming we get through all this, let me know. It used to be my job to answer those questions. Maybe it will be again.
DLC20001849	That's it?
DLC20001850	[FAILED] As far as you're concerned, it is. This really isn't the time to talk about it, all things considered.
DLC20001851	If you don't acknowledge your past now, it'll come back to you later.
DLC20001852	[SUCCEEDED] True enough. We can't escape it no matter how hard we try. Best we can do is own up, trust in the Lord to forgive.
DLC20001853	Joshua was gone, so were a lot of the other New Canaanites. White Legs must have been watching for a long while, counting who remained.
DLC20001854	We didn't think the White Legs were a real threat. Maybe it was overconfidence. Maybe sloth. Either way, we didn't see them coming.
DLC20001855	They attacked at night. They killed without regard to age or infirmity. Armed or unarmed. They beat children to-
DLC20001856	Beat them to death in their beds while they were sleeping. And now we're all that's left. Maybe thirty of us. Pride goeth before destruction.
DLC20001857	Were you close to Mordecai?
DLC20001858	Look, I've got a lot to do here. My personal relationship... it's not important right now. Can't see how it concerns you, anyway.
DLC20001859	What happened at New Canaan?
DLC20001860	We lost it. Our community, everything. But the past is gone. We have to look forward.
DLC20001861	The White Legs are here already, so what's your plan?
DLC20001862	To remove the Sorrows from harm's way. I have to give credit to the White Legs for finding their way here, though I imagine many died in the process.
DLC20001863	But they can't follow us east, not into the Grand Staircase. They don't know how to live off of the land. We head there, we can find some safety.
DLC20001864	Has this happened before, the White Legs attacking other tribes?
DLC20001865	Yes. But not just White Legs. Raiders too. Prospectors. Slavers. Anyone who thinks they can exploit the ignorant and the innocent.
DLC20001866	We lost the Tar Walkers. And the Crazy Horns. We did our best, but we made mistakes. We paid for them, but they paid more.
DLC20001867	I'd like to get out from under that debt someday. Until then, it's enough to stop ourselves from getting deeper in the hole.
DLC20001868	What does a bishop do? Is that your boss?
DLC20001869	Yeah, Bishop Mordecai is...
DLC20001870	Sorry. Mordecai was my bishop. He was killed by White Legs during the attack on New Canaan. He was responsible for our congregation there.
DLC20001871	I don't know who my next bishop will be. But that's a problem for tomorrow. There are plenty of troubles here for us today.
DLC20001872	Salvation? From what, the wasteland?
DLC20001873	A spiritual wasteland, yes. We believe that before this life, our souls existed elsewhere. And after we die, our souls will leave this world.
DLC20001874	During our time here, we have the burden of choice. The choices we make determine where we go in the spirit world, and how we will face judgment.
DLC20001875	New Canaanites believe, as many once did, that God was made flesh here on Earth as a man named Jesus Christ. He sacrificed his life to save us.
DLC20001876	Every sin, every terrible thing that you, me, or any one of us have done for all time, was washed away by his blood. We just have to accept his love.
DLC20001877	That's why we visit the tribes, to spread the good news. For all we know, we New Canaanites may be all that remains of Christ's followers.
DLC20001878	You said you "used to" help the Sorrows with problems. What do you do now?
DLC20001879	I'm trying to make amends for allowing our problem to become their problem. The New Canaanites, I mean.
DLC20001880	The White Legs have always fought with us, and with Joshua returning, Caesar has motivated the White Legs to stamp out the New Canaanites entirely.
DLC20001881	That means the tribes we work with, too. It's already hap- I just want to prevent something terrible from happening to the Sorrows.
DLC20001882	What do you do here?
DLC20001883	I used to help the Sorrows with various medical problems and general issues they were having, but my bishop sent me here as a missionary.
DLC20001884	We New Canaanites believe that there is a path to salvation for everyone and it's important that we set people on that path if they are willing.
DLC20001885	I had some other questions for you.
DLC20001886	What's on your mind?
DLC20001887	Uh... you might want to have a chat with them. They think your "Lord" and the "Father" are the same.
DLC20001888	Oh. Ah. Of course. How stupid of me. They probably also think Mary is the mother and Jesus is the child.
DLC20001889	No wonder they picked up on things so easily. I guess it just goes to show how difficult it is to communicate sometimes.
DLC20001890	What do you know about the Father in the Caves?
DLC20001891	Father in the? Oh, right. He's some spirit the Sorrows used to believe in, watched over them from the caves in the valley.
DLC20001892	They marked some of the caves around here because they think they'll be punished for going inside.
DLC20001893	I think as more of them learn the teachings of the New Canaanites, they'll lose their old superstitions.
DLC20001894	What did you say about a courier? Who were you expecting?
DLC20001895	Caesar would never admit this openly, but he knows that I'm alive. I've killed enough of his frumentarii and assassins that have come looking.
DLC20001896	I've heard one of them travels the Mojave as a courier. Most of Caesar's agents meet a fitting end in NCR territory, but maybe this one survived.
DLC20001897	Fine by me. I prefer the wilderness.
DLC20001898	Then let him know. Follows-Chalk needs more guidance in his life. I'd prefer it not come from me.
DLC20001899	If people want to look to me for how to fight, I will show them how. I believe God put me on this Earth for that very reason.
DLC20001900	But to live like me, think like me... no. There are better people for them to look to for such things.
DLC20001901	Hmm. Okay.
DLC20001902	Whatever you tell him, I'm sure it will be fine.
DLC20001903	It's still his choice to make. I just want him to make it without looking to me for approval. He's a man. He can make his own decisions.
DLC20001904	You know that means I'm going to encourage him to leave, right?
DLC20001905	Follows-Chalk needs more guidance in his life. Just not from me.
DLC20001906	Who are you to decide this?
DLC20001907	[FAILED] I am the right hand of the Lord and the instrument of his vengeance!
DLC20001908	If what you believe is true, he'll pay for it later. The Sorrows don't need to see you do this.
DLC20001909	I want to take from them what they took from me, from my family. In this life. I want them to suffer. I want all of them to die in fear and pain.
DLC20001910	I want to have my revenge. Against him. Against Caesar. I want to call it my own, to make my anger God's anger. To justify the things I've done.
DLC20001911	Sometimes I tell myself that these wild fires never stop burning. But I'm the one who starts them. Not God. Not them.
DLC20001912	I can always see it in my mind. The warmth and the heat. It will always be a part of me. But not today.
DLC20001913	[SUCCEEDED] Go. Get out of here. Go back. Back to the Great Salt Lake.
DLC20001914	Wait, Joshua! Don't!
DLC20001915	[FAILED] No! He and his tribe have worked hard for their wages. Who am I to deny them?
DLC20001916	There. That's it. It's finished. When they hear what happened here, the White Legs will crawl back to their Great Salt Lake.
DLC20001917	If Caesar doesn't kill them, they'll wither and die like the cursed mongrels they are.
DLC20001918	Come. Let's find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon. And there is still much work to be done.
DLC20001919	That's it. It's finished. Thank you for... staying with me. I couldn't have done this on my own.
DLC20001920	Let's go find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon. And there is much to do.
DLC20001921	It's the same end he would have met if he had died on his knees. But I suppose this was for the sake of the Dead Horses and Sorrows.
DLC20001922	Still, thanks to your help and the grace of God, the White Legs won't be troubling Zion anymore.
DLC20001923	Let's go find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon enough. And there is much to do.
DLC20001924	You don't think Lanius can lead the Legion?
DLC20001925	I think only Caesar can lead the Legion. I've never met anyone who could take his place. I couldn't. I never had a mind for logistics.
DLC20001926	I don't know Lanius, but from what I've heard, he has no interest in leading anyone unless it's in battle.
DLC20001927	No. The Legion dies with Caesar. What follows now are just the last steps of a man who does not yet realize that he's walking dead.
DLC20001928	We'll see.
DLC20001929	The Lord shall reveal all things in good time.
DLC20001930	They won't. I'll make sure the Legion has very little to go home with.
DLC20001931	Hmm. Good. You're doing God's work, whether you believe it or not.
DLC20001932	Caesar is dead. I saw to it personally. I thought you should know.
DLC20001933	I have to admit, it's hard to believe. That even after all he did to me, all he tried to do to find and erase me from this world, he went first.
DLC20001934	No doubt this will be good for the Mojave. I can only hope Arizona and the tribes don't suffer as the Legion falls apart around them.
DLC20001935	I've met Caesar, you know. What do you think he would say if I told him you were here?
DLC20001936	I think that would put him - and you - in a difficult position. Caesar has agents looking for me, but he won't admit I'm alive.
DLC20001937	And even if you killed me, he can't acknowledge that. To do so would be to admit I had never died. That Caesar made a mistake.
DLC20001938	No. He lives by his lies and shall die by his lies. There is no escaping it.
DLC20001939	I've got your number, that's all. Just wanted you to know.
DLC20001940	Fine, just keep it to yourself, all right? Don't be such a fucking jerk about it.
DLC20001941	Just wait here a few minutes. Don't do anything crazy.
DLC20001942	We wait, but not forever!
DLC20001943	Sure, whatever. We go smash White Legs.
DLC20001944	We go!
DLC20001945	Fine, but at least let me handle it alone. You're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
DLC20001946	Just get out of here, you're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
DLC20001947	[SUCCEEDED] Because you are friend to Sorrows... very well. We go. Angry ghosts will do for White Legs.
DLC20001948	[FAILED] No! We not let White Legs defile our ancestors! We go! We fight!
DLC20001949	No, I smash White Legs alone. You stay here so you not get dead.
DLC20001950	Hmph. Since you are friend to Sorrows... we go. But you kill White Legs!
DLC20001951	It is good to travel with another. I spend so long scouting on my own that I forget what human company is like.
DLC20001952	I have seen many strange plants in the valley - plants that seem to hunger for human flesh. Where they come from, I do not know.
DLC20001953	White Leg attacks grow more frequent each day - I fear for our people and for our valley if something is not done.
DLC20001954	Oh Father, guide and protect us your humble children as we labor in the vineyards, and make us strong to resist those who would steal Zion from us.
DLC20001955	I wish you could have met my family. You would like them, I think.
DLC20001956	Zion used to be a place of peace, you know. Daniel says that it is holy in the eyes of the Father. I hope someday you will see it as it was.
DLC20001957	Father, I ask that you guide this man who is the vessel of your will. Show him the light of your wisdom and the peace of your love. Amen.
DLC20001958	Father, I ask that you guide this woman who is the vessel of your will. Show her the light of your wisdom and the peace of your love. Amen.
DLC20001959	Daniel says that most people outside the valley do not keep to the Father's ways. Perhaps when you leave you will carry His word with you?
DLC20001960	When Salt-Upon-Wounds took New Canaan, he ordered the White Legs to salt the earth so nothing could grow again. What kind of monster could do that?
DLC20001961	I know you are eager to leave Zion, but... perhaps you might find peace if you stayed. Think about it, yes?
DLC20001962	The river is lovely at this time of day, don't you think?
DLC20001963	The river is lovely at this time of night, don't you think?
DLC20001964	Please be respectful here - these are the bones of our ancestors.
DLC20001965	So this is the Ghost of She's lair. I was never brave enough to try to find it....
DLC20001966	Civilization isn't perfect, but neither is tribal life. You should go see it for yourself.
DLC20001967	Really? You think so? Hoo! I'm going to do it. After all this is over, I'm going to go explore civilization!
DLC20001968	Dank ni, ahk iss - I never would have had the growans to ask him myself.
DLC20001969	You should stay here with your people. You have a duty to them.
DLC20001970	I see. Well, thanks for your telling. I'd like a minute alone to think about this. Dank ni.
DLC20001971	He said he has a hard time being objective about the whole idea, and that I should give you advice.
DLC20001972	He said that? Well, I guess you have been out there more recently than he has. So... what's your advice?
DLC20001973	We should not be here! The Three Marys is where the White Legs make their camp! We should leave, quickly.
DLC20001974	I am always a little sad to leave the Narrows, and happy to return.
DLC20001975	It has been some time since I visited the Dead Horses. Our tribes don't have much contact with each other.
DLC20001976	This is Pine Creek, one of the only ways out of Zion Valley. Watch out - many dangerous beasts lair nearby.
DLC20001977	These are places of the time before. We should not be here - it is forbidden!
DLC20001978	Tell me about the Ghost of She.
DLC20001979	That is a sad story. I do not like to tell it, but if you are asking, it must be at White Bird's request. That, I will honor.
DLC20001980	Long ago, a girl lived among this tribe. She was a curious child, and a clever one, and her mother had a devil's time watching over her.
DLC20001981	One day, the child slipped away from camp and went to play in the caves nearby. The girl did not know that a Yao Guai slept in that cave.
DLC20001982	The girl died. The tribe wept, for the girl had died before her naming day, and her ghost would remain restless and wandering upon the earth.
DLC20001983	Many hunters tried to kill the beast, but it eluded them, or drove them off. The shaman said that since it had consumed the girl, the two were one.
DLC20001984	So we call the beast Ghost of She, for the child had no name to be called. That is the story of the Ghost of She. It is a sad story. It is our story.
DLC20001985	Who or what is the Ghost of She?
DLC20001986	Sad story. Not for your ears from my lips. Ask midwife. She speak to your ears.
DLC20001987	Feels good to be doing some actual scouting, not just following.
DLC20001988	I hear some odd things about the civilized lands outside Zion. Is there really a giant thunder-lizard people live inside?
DLC20001989	The spitter plants and the green monster men aren't native to Zion. Wonder where they came from?
DLC20001990	So I finally get to explore all those taboo places without the other scouts yelling at me? Can't wait!
DLC20001991	Bet they don't have anything as nasty as Yao Guai out where you come from, huh?
DLC20001992	Those, um, what did you call them? Walkie talkies? Those are going to be loads better than signal drums and smoke signs.
DLC20001993	That compass thing always knows where north is, huh? Even if it can't see the stars?
DLC20001994	That Back When medicine smells funny. Guess it works though.
DLC20001995	There can't really be a place where people go into big buildings and give away all their money just to watch someone flip paper squares on a table...
DLC20001996	Way I heard it, Salt-Upon-Wounds butchered everyone in New Canaan and nailed their corpses to the cliffs.
DLC20001997	Why do you carry all those bottlecaps, anyway? They jangle like crazy.
DLC20001998	Look sharp, lots of giant ants around here. We call 'em picnic-killers. Don't really know what that means. Something from Back When, I guess.
DLC20001999	Must have been nice, when Zion was friendly enough folks could make camp wherever they pleased and not worry about White Legs and deadly critters.
DLC20002000	"Scenic Overlook." What do you suppose that means?
DLC20002001	See that tower? Back When, folks used them to talk to each other on the air. Not like with signal drums, they could actually talk! Amazing, huh?
DLC20002002	See this? This is why your own two feet are better than any cart, whether it's pulled by critters or goes on its own.
DLC20002003	That thing actually flew once, like a big metal bird? Bet you don't have to follow chalk marks up there....
DLC20002004	You ever seen anything like these green men? Sure as anything they aren't from around here.
DLC20002005	Some kind of view up here, neh? If you know how to look, you can spot all kinds of landmarks from up here. Look, I'll show you.
DLC20002006	Hoi! Owslandr zookuh Joshua Graham?
DLC20002007	I've already got the roots you need.
DLC20002008	Umm... what?
DLC20002009	Show respect, owslandr! Joshua Graham greatest warchief!
DLC20002010	Am I... looking for Joshua? Yes, I am. Can you tell me where he is?
DLC20002011	You know our tongue - smart owslandr.
DLC20002012	Joshua in high place of cave. You show respect, utman! Joshua is greatest warrior. You show him no respect, he show you thunder and fire!
DLC20002013	If you're too dumb to speak my language, you're too dumb to talk to me. Get lost.
DLC20002014	Yes, I'm looking for him. Is he here?
DLC20002015	He in high place of cave. You show respect, owslandr! Joshua is greatest warrior. You show him no respect, he show you thunder and fire!
DLC20002016	I'll make sure to be on my best behavior, then.
DLC20002017	You wise for owslandr.
DLC20002018	Umm... okay. Thanks for that. I sure would hate to be shown thunder and fire.
DLC20002019	Ha ha. Funny owslandr. Maybe soon dead owslandr.
DLC20002020	Back off, savage - I'm just here for a map out of this shithole valley, not kowtow to your messiah.
DLC20002021	Shaiss! Would kill you myself, but Joshua says no harm to visitors until harm done to us.
DLC20002022	Go, owslandr. Meet Joshua. We see how long you talk like that.
DLC20002023	Vow of secrecy? Fine, forget about it.
DLC20002024	Forget it? Uh uh. Ricky remembers everything! But he keeps his secrets, too!
DLC20002025	What do you know about Salt-Upon-Wounds?
DLC20002026	He is war chief of the White Legs, and the worst butcher of them all. The tribes he has crushed are many. The warriors he has slain, countless.
DLC20002027	Here we are. Joshua's just ahead there, in the Angel Cave.
DLC20002028	Nearly there now. Watch out for traps in the water. Got to keep the White Legs out somehow, neh?
DLC20002029	Hang on, you're going the wrong way!
DLC20002030	I thought we were going to the Dead Horses camp?
DLC20002031	Hold up, you're getting all turned around. Check your map and backtrack a little.
DLC20002032	Where are you going? That's not the way to the camp!
DLC20002033	I'm happy to travel with you, but you're not headed toward the Dead Horses anymore.
DLC20002034	Down this path to the north. Hope you don't mind getting wet.
DLC20002035	You see the dead sentries? Shamans say our enemies' souls are trapped in them, but Joshua says it shows we're serious about fighting White Legs.
DLC20002036	Follow the old road south, nearly there.
DLC20002037	Keep headed north, around this rock pile.
DLC20002038	You can take the path north here if you want, or head east over the ridge. There's a nice view from the top of that cliff, if you want a look.
DLC20002039	We follow this path for a while. Nice view of the river, neh?
DLC20002040	I have some gear that needs repairs.
DLC20002041	I have some gear that needs repairs.
DLC20002042	Let me have a look. My tribe may take too much pride in its mechanical talents, but in truth we are intrigued by the workings of a fine firearm.
DLC20002043	Let me have a look.
DLC20002044	I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
DLC20002045	Owslandr utman zookuh Joshua Graham? You look for Joshua Graham?
DLC20002046	Huh, I think I know that guy. Small world.
DLC20002047	Is it? I always heard it was rather large outside the valley. Well, wherever he is, I hope he's well.
DLC20002048	I know that guy! I got him a job!
DLC20002049	A job as a singer? Then it really is true....
DLC20002050	Any idea where to start looking for these pre-War supplies Daniel needs?
DLC20002051	Best place to look for Back When stuff is the taboo places. Sorrows and Dead Horses don't go in there, and even White Legs don't like them much.
DLC20002052	What taboo places?
DLC20002053	Lots of them around the valley - places built by the folk from Back When. You'll know them when you see them - scouts mark them with hand prints.
DLC20002054	The hand prints are a warning to keep out - angry ghosts live inside. Not that I believe in angry ghosts. They're just spooky old places. Right?
DLC20002055	Where should we start looking?
DLC20002056	Lots of Back When places to choose from, but for the things we need, best to start with the really closed up places.
DLC20002057	Three I know of: a building down by the river called a "Fishing Lodge," the old ranger station in the northwest, and the general store right by it.
DLC20002058	Closer to home, might be something you can salvage from the place where the little ones fell, just west of the Eastern Virgin.
DLC20002059	What's this "place where the little ones fell?"
DLC20002060	In the river, there's a twisted pile of metal and glass, all full of bones. Joshua says they were scouts, but they looked awful small to me.
DLC20002061	Lots of that old stuff, how do you say it... electronics? Maybe you could use some of it.
DLC20002062	White Legs? Those are the people who attacked us?
DLC20002063	Yah, and they're still back there! Let's go get them!
DLC20002064	If you're willing, I'll take the help.
DLC20002065	Goot sists. Let's show them what we're made of!
DLC20002066	Forget it, I'm out of here.
DLC20002067	You're not going to fight? But... okay. You better come with me, then. Joshua will want to see you.
DLC20002068	Hoo! That's for the White Legs! Sorry we weren't fast enough to save your friends, though. The Dead Horses will remember them in our prayers.
DLC20002069	You should come with me now - Joshua Graham will want to meet a visitor from the civilized lands.
DLC20002070	Freeze! Don't move a muscle. Yao Guai.
DLC20002071	Hoo! That was some kind of lucky. Guess that one was all full of gecko, neh? Don't get used to it, though. Yao Guai are plenty mean as a rule.
DLC20002072	What do you know of Salt-Upon-Wounds?
DLC20002073	He's a butcher. Believe me, I know the godless fire that burns in his heart. I've been burned by it myself.
DLC20002074	He's not the kind to let his subordinates do all the killing. No, he likes to have a hand in it, with that spear of his.
DLC20002075	He's fashioned himself an abomination before the eyes of the Lord. I'm happy to serve as an instrument of divine justice.
DLC20002076	What do you know of the White Legs?
DLC20002077	They're hateful savages who live only to plunder and destroy. Their leader is a devil called Salt-Upon-Wounds.
DLC20002078	War is what all he knows. Everything he has, everything that tribe has, was taken by force, raiding and scavenging.
DLC20002079	It's said there's no man deadlier at close range, that that powerfist of his has smashed a hundred skulls.
DLC20002080	Maybe that's true, but so what? It's a low form of leadership. A tribe that knows only war has no future. And so he'll lead them to Caesar.
DLC20002081	Here, take five of my healing powders.
DLC20002082	That's very generous of you. Five doses will help a great deal.
DLC20002083	Here, take three of my healing powders.
DLC20002084	Thanks. That will help a good deal.
DLC20002085	How do you know so much about what happened to me?
DLC20002086	The Dead Horses are capable scouts. Nothing passes into or out of Zion without my hearing of it.
DLC20002087	See those handprints? Dead Horses and Sorrows mark them on taboo places, places from Back When. Good thing for you I don't buy into that stuff.
DLC20002088	These paintings show the Dead Horses' victories against other tribes. Lots more of them since Joshua came to us.
DLC20002089	Ain't the trail ahead worries me, Jed. Those descents we made, through that slot canyon back up there?
DLC20002090	Ain't no way we're getting back out the way we come. And then what?
DLC20002091	Goddammit, Stella, heard you the first time, and the fifteenth, too.
DLC20002092	The New Canaanites will know a way. And if they don't, we got the maps on our friend's Pip-Boy over there.
DLC20002093	Enough lollygagging! Get moving and keep an eye out for tribals!
DLC20002094	Goodbye.
DLC20002095	Yeah, whatever.
DLC20002096	Goodbye.
DLC20002097	Catch you another time, then.
DLC20002098	Probably just a tribal ghost story. But New Canaan's been silent for a long time. Maybe it's a coincidence. Maybe the Malpais Legate is dead.
DLC20002099	Or maybe Joshua Graham did crawl out of that canyon and finally found his way back home.
DLC20002100	He got his wish. Joshua Graham disappeared. And in his place came legends of the Burned Man walking the wastes.
DLC20002101	All this talk bothered Caesar, so he forbade anyone from speaking his name. Wanted to erase Joshua Graham from history.
DLC20002102	Not long after, some of the slaves and tribals started to talk. Said Graham wasn't dead. Shouldn't have been any surprise.
DLC20002103	He had Graham covered in pitch, lit on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon. People say he didn't even scream on the way down.
DLC20002104	Caesar had to make an example for the others, to show them that even at the highest level, failure wouldn't be tolerated.
DLC20002105	Well at Hoover Dam, the Malpais Legate finally met his match. Hanlon and Oliver kicked his New Canaanite butt right back over the river.
DLC20002106	Legend goes that Graham was the meanest, toughest son of a bitch in the whole damned Legion.
DLC20002107	The New Canaanites wouldn't talk about him. They were ashamed. Guess I can't blame 'em.
DLC20002108	Turns out Caesar's first war chief, the Malpais Legate, was a New Canaanite. Joshua Graham.
DLC20002109	But then the Legion appeared in Arizona. I reckon you know all about them.
DLC20002110	We've seen our share of cults, but the New Canaanites, they were honest traders. Good fighters, too. Raiders wouldn't tangle with 'em.
DLC20002111	Didn't know much about them, except that they were religious folks. Sent out missionaries to talk to the tribes.
DLC20002112	A few decades back, folks in the NCR started to hear about a community in northern Utah called New Canaan.
DLC20002113	The paths we're following are slow going, so you might as well keep your ears open and listen to what old Jed has to say.
