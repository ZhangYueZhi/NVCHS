TIH00000152	I heard ya'll had quite a fight down there at the station. What's the report on Beaumont?
TIH00000153	What do you need?
TIH00000154	...
TIH00000155	What can I do for you?
TIH00000156	Ugh... I'm hurting for a fix.
TIH00000157	What do you need?
TIH00000158	...
TIH00000159	What is it?
TIH00000160	Yeah?
TIH00000161	What is it?
TIH00000162	Yeah?
TIH00000163	I got something for you.
TIH00000164	...
TIH00000165	Yes?
TIH00000166	...
TIH00000167	Good to see you! What do you think of the place? We've already found homes for over a dozen children.
TIH00000168	Yes?
TIH00000169	Salve, barbarus. Quaero servis meis?
TIH00000170	Me adiuvare potes?
TIH00000171	Es stultus? Ubi sunt servis meis?
TIH00000172	Excuse me, I have an urgent delivery from Westside.
TIH00000173	...
TIH00000174	Thank you for coming. We've got a situation that we can't handle ourselves.
TIH00000175	Since you kicked the Syndicate out of town, it seems the Fiends are running low on chems and weapons.
TIH00000176	Normally they're just like a pack of dumb dogs, content when they're doped up, easy to kill or scare off.
TIH00000177	But now... they're rabid. They're getting bolder and bolder, desperate to get caps for chems. The Khans are more than happy to profit from this.
TIH00000178	A few days ago a group of them ambushed the Burke family. They were good people. Everybody knew them. Only their boy is alive now.
TIH00000179	Fucking Fiends are holding him ransom. They said they want 50,000 caps or the kid dies. See the letter for yourself.
TIH00000180	They mentioned you specifically, said something about outfit gold. I didn't know what to make of it.
TIH00000181	All I know is they will only negotiate with you. They're in an abandoned house not far from the west entrance.
TIH00000182	...
TIH00000183	Hold it right the fuck there! No sudden movements, dickshit!
TIH00000184	You're that Courier who got rich, right? Good, I knew you'd come. You hand over the caps, and we'll let the boy live.
TIH00000185	I got nothing to say to you.
TIH00000186	<The child looks up at you silently; he is clearly traumatized by his recent captivity>
TIH00000187	Hello, Courier. Ironic, isn't it? I'm bringing a message to the messenger.
TIH00000188	Excuse me, I have an urgent delivery for you. Here, it's just this letter.
TIH00000189	What is it?
TIH00000190	Have you reconsidered my offer?
TIH00000191	Please deliver the package. Leave me be.
TIH00000192	Look, I'm on duty. If you've got something to say, make it quick.
TIH00000193	Shut your suck and kill some Fiends!
TIH00000194	C'mon, do it!
TIH00000195	Goddamn, I haven't seen that many raiders since I guarded a caravan passing through 80's territory.
TIH00000196	You're a courier, right? After that little fracas, you can color me surprised. You moved like a merc. Glad you were here.
TIH00000197	Now that we've got a little breathing room, I'd like to check out that package.
TIH00000198	You reconsidered the deal?
TIH00000199	I gotta stand guard. We'll talk when you've taken care of the Fiends.
TIH00000200	Ah, the intrepid explorers! Let me just say, it's been a pleasure tracking your adventures.
TIH00000201	Some close calls... you even found places we didn't know about. Truly commendable.
TIH00000202	...
TIH00000203	...
TIH00000204	Yeah?
TIH00000205	You know, I wasn't sure if I'd actually get to meet you. I guess it's something of an honor, you know, all things considered.
TIH00000206	Most of the outfit calls me Tony... well, Mr. Chase. I know you're "The Courier" or whatever. What's your real name, pal?
TIH00000207	...
TIH00000208	...
TIH00000209	Easy, Courier. No ambuscades down here. Have a seat if you like. We have a lot to talk about.
TIH00000210	I'm curious as to what brought you here. I've heard so many stories... please forgive my fascination. I seldom get to meet a legend.
TIH00000211	Paulie, you need to cut out the smoke break...
TIH00000212	Fuck! Fuck me, it's you!
TIH00000213	What?

TIH00000398	aaInheritance01SellersGreeting02
TIH00000399	Yes, I recognize you.
TIH00000400	A regular courier would suffice, but you... well, this is fortuitous.
TIH00000401	You're a person of many parts, aren't you? I heard you cheated death... left quite a mark around here.
TIH00000402	Nothing like being dug out of a shallow grave to give you perspective, eh?
TIH00000403	How do you know about that?
TIH00000404	All this time, everything you've done, your choices, the people you've killed... you can't control that story.
TIH00000405	You may not realize it, but you're becoming the stuff of legend, whether you like it or not.
TIH00000406	If not for my infirm condition, I'd be apt to hear your take on things. But time, I'm afraid, is of the essence.
TIH00000407	You have made your choices, seen the consequences. I did much the same, long ago, in another life. I am still paying for those choices.
TIH00000408	Couriers have a special role, one of trust. I hope you will maintain that fidelity, as this delivery... it's... I can't put this off any longer.
TIH00000409	I want you to deliver a package to a man in Westside. His name is Bradley.
TIH00000410	In exchange, I will pay you five hundred caps, all up front. Consider a gesture of good will and trust.
TIH00000411	Is the proposal satisfactory?
TIH00000412	No offense, but I'd like to discuss the delivery job.
TIH00000413	That's well enough, no offense taken. I know you're a person of gravity, so I will cleave to the matter at hand.
TIH00000414	I want you to deliver a package to a man in Westside. His name is Bradley.
TIH00000415	In exchange, I will pay you five hundred caps, all up front. I know your reputation.
TIH00000416	Is the proposal satisfactory?
TIH00000417	Stow it, pops. You want something delivered, start talking turkey.
TIH00000418	What a world I'm leaving behind... a haven for brutes, savages, and the uncouth. It certainly fits you.
TIH00000419	Whatever your temperament, I know your reputation as a courier. Thus, I will get to my offer.
TIH00000420	I want you to deliver a package to a man in Westside. His name is Bradley.
TIH00000421	In exchange, I will pay you five hundred caps, all up front. Consider it a gesture of good will and trust.
TIH00000422	Is the proposal satisfactory?
TIH00000423	I'll do it.
TIH00000424	As I expected, you are perfect for the job.
TIH00000425	Deliver this letter and key to Bradley, a mercenary under the employ of the Westside Militia.
TIH00000426	Once the letter is delivered, you are free of any responsibility to me. However, if you elect to assist Bradley, I will be in your debt.
TIH00000427	I hope this will be an end to things... a just settlement. Good luck, courier. I would like to be alone now.
TIH00000428	I'm not interested.
TIH00000429	I hope you will reconsider. Please return if you change your mind.
TIH00000430	aaInheritance01SellersBarter
TIH00000431	The opportunistic avarice of the wasteland never ceases to surprise me. Very well. This is all I have.
TIH00000432	Deliver this letter and key to Bradley, a mercenary under the employ of the Westside Militia.
TIH00000433	Once the letter is delivered, you are free of any responsibility to me. However, if you elect to assist Bradley, I will be in your debt.
TIH00000434	I hope this will be an end to things... a just settlement. Good luck, courier. I would like to be alone now.
TIH00000435	I suspect there is more to this package than meets the eye. Make it 1,000 and we have a deal.
TIH00000436	You're trying to squeeze water from a dry sponge, courier. I have nothing left to give.
TIH00000437	Five hundred caps - nothing more, nothing less. Do you accept?
TIH00000438	Since that incident in Goodsprings my rates have gone up. Make it 1,500 and we're good.
TIH00000439	aaInheritance01BradleyIntro01
TIH00000440	I've got a delivery for you.
TIH00000441	What? Are you sure it's for me?
TIH00000442	Alright, give me a second... hold on. Thought I heard something...
TIH00000443	aaInheritance01BradleyIntroDeliveryAsshole
TIH00000444	Service with a smile, huh? I'm on watch right now. I don't have time for this shit.
TIH00000445	Look, don't get your panties in a wad. Let me finish this shift and I'll sign for the package.
TIH00000446	Just... wait, I thought I heard something...
TIH00000447	Listen, jagoff - I just hauled this letter across the desert for you. How about some gratitude?
TIH00000448	aaInheritance01BradleyPostFiendAttackWestside
TIH00000449	Goddamn, I haven't seen that many raiders since I guarded a caravan passing through 80's territory.
TIH00000450	You're a courier, right? After that little fracas, color me impressed. You moved like a merc. Glad you were here.
TIH00000451	Since we've got a little breathing room, I'd like to check out that package.
TIH00000452	A sealed letter. Let's see what it says...
TIH00000453	aaInheritance01BradleyReadLetter
TIH00000454	Dear Bradley, my name is Joe Sellers. I'm almost certain you've never heard of me. No shit.
TIH00000455	Consider this my last will and testament. Your father, Joe Sellers.
TIH00000456	I understand if you wish to dispose of this note and erase any notion of connection to me. You would be more than justified.
TIH00000457	It's been so long since these measures were put in place - I have no idea what you'll find there, aside from the next key.
TIH00000458	Enclosed with this letter is a key, the first of three required to open the vault. The next key is in Linus Caverns, in the Mesquite Mountains.
TIH00000459	However, I believe your profession has given you the skills and necessary fortitude to see this through.
TIH00000460	Make no mistake: this is not a simple salvage. You must walk a dangerous path to collect the means to access the vault.
TIH00000461	There is nothing I can offer to make up for the pain I inflicted on you and your mother. But I still owe you this birthright. It is all I have left.
TIH00000462	There is a vault in the Mojave that contains enough wealth to let you start anew. You could leave the hazards of the frontier behind you.
TIH00000463	I know you have subsisted as a soldier of fortune for some time. I never wanted that life for you.  Better than your life, cocksucker.
TIH00000464	If you hate me or only wish to ignore me, I only beg you accept my parting gift. Consider it my feeble attempt to reckon for your abandonment.
TIH00000465	As a result, I cut all ties with your mother. She went to Reno, and I wandered. I've no doubt you harbor resentment for my actions.  Fuck you.
TIH00000466	Not long after I met your mother, there was a war, and I was on the losing side. Mere association with me could be mistaken for complicity.
TIH00000467	It was not for a lack of feeling or to shirk responsibility.  Bull-fucking-shit.  On the contrary, I became an exile to ensure your safety.
TIH00000468	I will get to the point: I am your father. I separated with your mother not long after you were born. The reasons for my decision are complicated.
TIH00000469	I made choices long ago that impacted you more than you may know. I often question my decisions, how things turned out.
TIH00000470	When I wrote this letter, I was unsure if I'd summon the nerve to send it. Ok.
TIH00000471	aaInheritance01BradleyPostLetter
TIH00000472	No bullshit - is this some kind of con? Come clean or I'll buttstroke your fucking skull!
TIH00000473	aaInheritance01BradleyPostLetterDontKnowPolite
TIH00000474	Excuse my skepticism, but what the fuck am I supposed to make of this? Some old coot writes me, says I inherited his stash.
TIH00000475	Even if it's a con, it's shit. He expects me to go digging through fuck knows what kind of shitholes to get some keys? Fuck that noise.
TIH00000476	I just deliver the goods. I'm not privy to what's inside.
TIH00000477	Back off, asshole. I'm just the courier.
TIH00000478	Excuse my skepticism, but what the fuck am I supposed to make of this? Some old coot writes me, says I can grab a legendary stash.
TIH00000479	Even if it's a con, it's shit. He expects me to go digging through fuck knows what kind of shitholes to get some keys? Fuck that noise.
TIH00000480	I do my job and you want to get fresh? Fuck you and your daddy issues.
TIH00000481	Careful - "Shoot the messenger" can take on a literal quality.
TIH00000482	I just wanted to be sure you're not pulling one on me. Sorry I got you all hot and bothered.
TIH00000483	What the fuck am I supposed to make of this letter, anyway? Some old coot writes me, says I can have his legendary stash.
TIH00000484	Even if it's a con, it's shit. He expects me to go digging through fuck knows what kind of shitholes to get some keys? Fuck that noise.
TIH00000485	aaInheritance01BradleyLetterCouldBeTrue
TIH00000486	Still, I have no way of knowing if he's just another asshole.
TIH00000487	If he's what I think he is... ex-Enclave... that could be worth my time. Those old bastards still have munitions dumps scattered around.
TIH00000488	A lot of that pre-war tech sells for a mean price out here. Fucking Van Graffs gouge the shit out of everyone. It would be fun to undercut them.
TIH00000489	I'm not opposed to investigating this, and I'd be willing to split some of the goods if you help out. Seems you know how to handle yourself.
TIH00000490	Only thing is that I'm under contract to Westside, and as you just saw, there's something of a Fiend problem.
TIH00000491	I don't know where they get the manpower, but Fiends keep coming out of the woodwork to attack Westside.
TIH00000492	Even though badass bounty hunters killed some of their ringleaders, it seems someone else is stepping in to stir them into a frenzy.
TIH00000493	Rumor has it some strung-out witch doctor has the Fiends on a drug-fueled holy war against Westside. Really, I couldn't make this up.
TIH00000494	It seems he's holed up in the old Hofmann mine just west of here. If you can take him out, the Fiend attacks should taper off.
TIH00000495	If the Fiends are neutralized, I should be clear of my duties here, at least long enough to track down that vault.
TIH00000496	I have to stand watch, but I'll throw in some caps if you take care of this for me. Afterwards we can strike off together. Deal?
TIH00000497	Sellers didn't strike me as a liar or huckster. This letter could be the real deal.
TIH00000498	aaInheritance01BradleyLetterIwillTakeIt
TIH00000499	No, no, no. I know better than that. I don't have any illusions of some Sierra Madre treasure buried in the desert, but there could be something.
TIH00000500	If he's what I think he is... ex-Enclave... that could be worth my time. Those old bastards still have munitions dumps scattered around.
TIH00000501	A lot of that pre-war tech sells for a mean price out here. Fucking Van Graffs gouge the shit out of everyone. It would be fun to undercut them.
TIH00000502	I'm not opposed to investigating this, and I'd be willing to split some of the goods if you help out. Seems you know how to handle yourself.
TIH00000503	Only thing is that I'm under contract to Westside, and as you just saw, there's something of a Fiend problem.

TIH00000509	I have to stand watch, but I'll throw in some caps if you take care of this for me. Afterwards we can strike off together. Deal?
TIH00000510	If you're not interested, I'd be happy to take that key off your hands.
TIH00000511	aaInheritance01BradleyLetterMeetFather
TIH00000512	Let's get something real clear: I don't have a father. Let's say, however unlikely it may be, that this old fuck knocked up my mom back in '41.
TIH00000513	Blowing your wad and walking away doesn't make you a father. This cocksucker has some nerve if he thinks he can just pay me off.
TIH00000514	Him and this Long John Silver bullshit, giving me a fucking treasure map to fuckall... to hell with that... to hell with him.
TIH00000515	This man could very well be your father. Don't you want to at least look into it?
TIH00000516	aaInheritance01BradleyAttackFiendsYes
TIH00000517	Good. Here's a few things I was holding on to. They should help you clear those fuckers out. Just check back with me when it's done.
TIH00000518	I'll do it.
TIH00000519	I don't think so.
TIH00000520	That's a shame. If you change your mind, I'll be here.
TIH00000521	I took care of Shulgin.
TIH00000522	I wasn't sure if you were serious when you took that on. There's no questioning your commitment now.
TIH00000523	That should dampen the Fiends' spirits for a while, so I'm free to travel. Are you ready to go?
TIH00000524	aaInheritance01BradleyTravel01Yes
TIH00000525	Ok, let's put that Pip-Boy to good use. Here are the coordinates for the vault.
TIH00000526	But before we head out there, I want to see this old man for myself.
TIH00000527	If he is who he claims to be, I at least want to look him in the eyes, see what sort of man he is.
TIH00000528	Chalk it up to dumb curiosity. Let's get going.
TIH00000529	Sure, let's get going.
TIH00000530	I'm not ready to go.
TIH00000531	Very well. I'll be here when you get your shit together.
TIH00000532	I was thinking of going after that stash.
TIH00000533	Look, I don't want to waste your time or mine. Are you sure about this?
TIH00000534	aaBradleyCompanionHeavyArmor
TIH00000535	Fuck my life, this shit is heavy.
TIH00000536	aaBradleyDadsDeadComment01
TIH00000537	Alright, let's see if... fuck me.
TIH00000538	Jesus, he's dead. Here I was, ready to spit in his eye, and he... hold on, that's blood... small caliber headshot, very clean, professional.
TIH00000539	Somebody was after him... why would they go to the trouble when he was on his deathbed?
TIH00000540	aaBradleyDadsDeadStartConvoPlayer
TIH00000541	What the hell have you gotten me into here? Did he say anything else about that stash?
TIH00000542	Did he mention other interested parties? What the fuck is going on here?
TIH00000543	I just agreed to deliver a package. He didn't mention anything else.
TIH00000544	Nothing at all? Really? Shit, I'm at a loss. This is not amateur work, I can tell you that much. I just wanted a payoff, not this mess.
TIH00000545	I say we walk out of here and forget about this entire thing. It isn't worth the trouble.
TIH00000546	I don't know shit about shit. I'm as much in the dark as you are.
TIH00000547	So you keep saying. This was not a robbery or some random murder, it was an expert execution. Believe me, I can distinguish the handiwork.
TIH00000548	I say we walk out of here and forget about this entire thing. It isn't worth the trouble.
TIH00000549	If he really was ex-Enclave, maybe it was a bounty hunter. They seem to be everywhere these days.
TIH00000550	Most bounty hunters are sloppy and stupid. To the untrained eye that would fit, but I'm telling you it was a precision shot made by a professional.
TIH00000551	I say we walk out of here and forget about this entire thing. It isn't worth the trouble.
TIH00000552	I got the impression you didn't like this guy. I figured you'd be happy.
TIH00000553	Listen, it's the principle of it, not to mention that we may be caught up in a real shitstorm now.
TIH00000554	I say we walk out of here and forget about this entire thing. It isn't worth the trouble.
TIH00000555	There's no telling what could turn up. I say we keep going.
TIH00000556	For the record, I think this is a mistake.
TIH00000557	But a deal is a deal, and I can't stomach the idea of you claiming that loot without me.
TIH00000558	I want to tool up before we do anything else. Let's head back to Westside and then we'll set off for the bunker.
TIH00000559	I agree, this wasn't part of the bargain. Let's go home.
TIH00000560	You said it. Let's head back to Westside. I'll settle up with you there.
TIH00000561	aaInheritance01HawkinsIntro
TIH00000562	Well, this is an auspicious occasion.
TIH00000563	I thought I was looking for a generic messenger, not the Courier. Quite a reputation you've developed in the Mojave.
TIH00000564	Who are you?
TIH00000565	Well, that's circumstantial. For the purposes of our business, you can call me Hawkins.
TIH00000566	What do you want?
TIH00000567	The late Mr. Sellers had a certain key in his possession that was given to you.
TIH00000568	Apparently Mr. Sellers neglected to inform you of his contractual obligation to my employer.
TIH00000569	The aforementioned key was to be passed to my employer upon Sellers' death. You could call it life insurance.
TIH00000570	Unfortunately, Mr. Sellers elected to break the contract, as he employed you to deliver the key to Mr. Bradley. This is a problem.
TIH00000571	I will not mince words, Courier. I know full well your reputation, your abilities. But I require that key.
TIH00000572	<Remain silent>
TIH00000573	I know that silence can reinforce the frontier mystique, but I can assure you, it's not impressive in the least.
TIH00000574	aaInheritance01HawkinsFuckOff
TIH00000575	Ah, the bravado of the wastes.
TIH00000576	I forget sometimes, lose touch. In the spirit of mutual bellicosity, permit me to retort in kind.
TIH00000577	Give me Sellers' key, or I'll cut your throat, and execute every person you've every cared about. Fair enough?
TIH00000578	Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying. Fuck off.
TIH00000579	aaInheritance01HawkinsKeySpeech
TIH00000580	I, I knew it when they told me it was the Courier, it was my death sentence. I don't deserve to die like this!
TIH00000581	Thank you, Courier. I am leaving this life behind me.
TIH00000582	How many have faced me and perished? Walk away and keep your life.
TIH00000583	You, you think I can't be charmed out of this? Do you know what my employer would do to me if I even hesitated?
TIH00000584	He would kill me... and my entire family!
TIH00000585	You don't have to do this, Hawkins.
TIH00000586	aaInheritance01HawkinsKeyNotGivingIt
TIH00000587	That brings us to a regrettable, though painfully familiar junction.
TIH00000588	I'm not giving up the key.
TIH00000589	aaInheritance01HawkinsKeyGiveIt
TIH00000590	aaInheritance01HawkinsKeyFuckYou
TIH00000591	People say the darndest things right before they die.
TIH00000592	Fuck. You.
TIH00000593	aaInheritance01HawkinsTerrifyingPresence
TIH00000594	I already killed all the people I care about. Now I'm working on random assholes. You're next.
TIH00000595	Fuck me, you really are crazy!
TIH00000596	aaInheritance01HawkinsKeyMakeFun
TIH00000597	You fuck, I'll... I'll...
TIH00000598	Fuck, I'll cut your kidney!
TIH00000599	I've met hobos with more attitude than you. Now get out of my face before you hurt yourself.
TIH00000600	aaInheritance01BradleyHawkinsDead
TIH00000601	We are now in a storm of fuck, my friend.
TIH00000602	That guy was Syndicate, no doubt about it. Connected, and dangerous. Fuck my life.
TIH00000603	That... I did not see coming. Fuck being a courier, you should run for office!
TIH00000604	You silver tongue may have bailed us out for the moment, but we are still in deep shit. That guy was Syndicate, I'm certain of it.
TIH00000605	What's the Syndicate?
TIH00000606	Organized crime and then some. I butted heads with a few of their low-level guys outside New Reno.
TIH00000607	They've all over the NCR, connected with Brahmin Barons, politicians, law enforcement. It was just a matter of time before they showed up here.
TIH00000608	Thing is, they wouldn't have sent that guy if the key wasn't worth it.
TIH00000609	Seeing as to how we're already on their radar, we may as well follow through and track down those keys. We've got nothing to lose now.
TIH00000610	The letter specified the coordinates for a place called Linus Cavern, located in the Mesquite Mountains. Let's see what we kind find there.
TIH00000611	I don't give a damn about the Syndicate. I'll bury those cockroaches.
TIH00000612	That's a damn foolish outlook. I know you've racked up quite a body count, but you don't understand. Once you're on their list, they never stop.
TIH00000613	And rest assured we are now on that list. The hell of it is that since we've got nothing to lose, we may as well look for those keys.
TIH00000614	The letter specified the coordinates for a place called Linus Cavern, located in the Mesquite Mountains. Let's see what we kind find there.
TIH00000615	If the Syndicate wanted the key that badly, the stash must be something special.
TIH00000616	Exactly. We're already on their hit list, so we may as well follow through and find those keys. We've got nothing to lose now.
TIH00000617	The letter specified the coordinates for a place called Linus Cavern, located in the Mesquite Mountains. Let's see what we kind find there.
TIH00000618	aaInheritance01BradleyKeyCard02Found
TIH00000619	Alright, you got it!
TIH00000620	Let's plug the's key's grid data into your Pip-Boy. 
TIH00000621	Damn, if I'm reading this right, we're headed for BFE, east of Nellis.
TIH00000622	Fuck it, we've come this far. I didn't survive the nightkin revival just to quit now. Lead the way, partner.
TIH00000623	aaBradleyGoodbye
TIH00000624	See you later.
TIH00000625	I need to get going.
TIH00000626	Lead the way.
TIH00000627	That's all. Let's keep moving.
TIH00000628	aaInheritance01BradleyKeyCard03Found
TIH00000629	So that's it - the last one.
TIH00000630	Let's plug this in and get the fuck out of here. I can feel the Rad-X wearing off.
TIH00000631	Ok... that's... odd.
TIH00000632	Says the stash is in the Vegas ruins... Fiend territory.
TIH00000633	Well, after fighting through fort zombie the Fiends will be nothing. Now let's get out of here before I start shitting plutonium.
TIH00000634	aaInheritance01BradleyHubTrapped01
TIH00000635	Fuck! Somebody just sealed that door up. We're trapped in this motherfucker.
TIH00000636	I think someone's using the intercom. Go ahead and see what these assholes want.
TIH00000637	Who are you?
TIH00000638	Name is Zimmer. I'm a... representative for a certain organization which has a stake in this vault.
TIH00000639	Who the fuck do you think you are, locking us in here?
TIH00000640	Name is Zimmer. I'm a... representative for a certain organization which has a stake in this vault.
TIH00000641	What do you want?
TIH00000642	Pretty simple. We want the gold and weapons sealed up in those vaults.
TIH00000643	Contractually, it belongs to us. I suppose Sellers neglected to mention that little caveat.
TIH00000644	You and Mr. Bradley were kind enough to lead my scouts here, and perhaps... I respect your commitment. So I offer you this.
TIH00000645	I will let one of you leave, right now. Who leaves... is entirely up to you and Bradley.
TIH00000646	I should inform you that my hacker friend has taken control of the security systems. I can fill that chamber with nerve gas in under a minute.
TIH00000647	Who would have thought a Fiend hacker could be so capable? I swear, they come from all walks of life. It never ceases to amaze me.
TIH00000648	If you find yourselves unwilling to settle things... well, just say the word and you can huff some VX. I hear it does wonders for the sinus pressure.
TIH00000649	I'll be eagerly watching this little contest through the camera, so don't consider any... trickery.
TIH00000650	Kill or be killed. Just as it should be.
TIH00000651	aaInheritance01ZimmerHubWhatYouWantCrazy
TIH00000652	You're with the Syndicate, aren't you?
TIH00000653	Really, it's only a name... some people call it the outfit, our thing... don't read into it too much.
TIH00000654	We are just a group of businessmen with shared interests. There's nothing more to it.
TIH00000655	I'm going to kill you.
TIH00000656	That... would be a twist.
TIH00000657	I swear to God you'll pay for this.
TIH00000658	Swearing to god, are we? Do you know how many people have made the same threat? Did god help them? Such a fatuous statement.
TIH00000659	If it's me or the other guy... it's going to be the other guy.
TIH00000660	That's the spirit! I'll be watching. It's impossible to ignore such a Darwinian contest.
TIH00000661	We shouldn't have to kill each other like animals. This is unfair... and barbaric.
TIH00000662	Did you just use "fair" in that sentence? After what happened with Hawkins, fair would be gassing you like lab rats right now.
TIH00000663	My organization has a reputation to uphold, and I can't let random wastelanders think they can piss on contracts and walk away.
TIH00000664	The only reason I'm going to let one of you live is that we never would have found this place, much less accessed it, without your efforts.
TIH00000665	Perhaps I'm naive, but I don't like to spit in the face of fortune. I'm giving you the privilege of a trial by ordeal - the strongest wins.
TIH00000666	aaInheritance01BradleyHubChoseWalk
TIH00000667	I wasn't sure what you'd say for a second there, so thanks for not putting me in that position. Let's get the hell out of here.
TIH00000668	aaInheritance01BradleyHubChoseCut
TIH00000669	Fuck, I don't want to do this, but... fuck me! I'm.... I'm sorry.
TIH00000670	aaInheritance01BradleyHubPostWalk
TIH00000671	So much for the money. No doubt the Syndicate goons will clean this place out after we leave. Fuck my life.
TIH00000672	Still, that was a close call. I like money as much as anyone else, but... I sort of prefer living. I don't know if this whole thing is worth it.
TIH00000673	I can tell this isn't settled in your mind, and it may turn into some sort of quest for you. If that's the case, I say more power to you.
TIH00000674	As for me... I'm going to pack my shit and head back to Reno. Sniping 80's is a lot safer than tangling with the Syndicate.
TIH00000675	This "Inheritance" is yours as much as it is mine, considering what we've been through. If you want it, you can have it. Consider this my blessing.
TIH00000676	Alright, it's been good travelling with you. Best of luck.
TIH00000677	Likewise, friend. If you find yourself in New Reno, look me up. Drinks will be on me.
TIH00000678	Fine, get the hell out of here. You've just been cramping my style.
TIH00000679	An asshole to the end, huh? Alright, good luck taking down the Syndicate. See you around, Courier.
TIH00000680	aaInheritance01BradleyHubWalkStickWithMeSpeech
TIH00000681	I don't know why I keep agreeing to stick with you, but... ok.
TIH00000682	I didn't take you for a quitter. You really want to just walk away from your birthright?
TIH00000683	That's not the issue. The Mojave... it isn't where I belong. There's been nothing but trouble since I moved here. I'm better off in Reno.
TIH00000684	You're going to let some thugs steal your inheritance? It's enough to set you for life.
TIH00000685	If you're set on leaving, at least take this - severance pay. Take care of yourself. <Give 500 caps>
TIH00000686	I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're a different sort than most of these animals. Even the best can lose their humanity in the wastes.
TIH00000687	You travel enough and forget that some people can rise above this shit. Thanks for reminding me there's still some good out there, Courier.
TIH00000688	If you're ever in New Reno, look me up. Good luck.
TIH00000689	I understand you're "connected."
TIH00000690	Maybe. What of it?
TIH00000691	Listen closely, freak. I'm going to ask you about the Syndicate, and you're going to answer me.
TIH00000692	Are you high? That must be psycho talking.
TIH00000693	Go take some fixer, see a doc, but don't talk to me again until you're head is screwed on straight, or I'll knock it the fuck off.

TIH00000695	I need to find Zimmer.
TIH00000696	I don't know anyone named Zimmer. Even if I did, why would I tell you?
TIH00000697	I want to let the Syndicate know that things are settled between us. It's over.
TIH00000698	Good for you. I'll let them know.
TIH00000699	aaInheritance01HastingsFindZimmerSpeech
TIH00000700	Hold on, that's a serious accusation. I just want the dope and caps to flow freely, not rampaging Fiends.
TIH00000701	Look, I don't know Zimmer. Never even met him. But, I know a guy who can tell you. His name is Chase. He's shacked up in Gomorrah.
TIH00000702	Chase is a heavy hitter, muscle for the Syndicate. He's got his own room. Here's I'll point it out on your map.
TIH00000703	In case you're wondering, I don't know you, and you don't know me. Don't speak to me again, and never mention my name in this.
TIH00000704	If the Fiends found out that the Syndicate is just using them, things could get... ugly.
TIH00000705	Please. The NCR doesn't give a fuck about junkies or the Syndicate. Even if they did, they got no manpower to follow through. Keep dreaming.
TIH00000706	I bet NCR authorities would be interested in your arrangment with the Fiends.

TIH00000710	Chase is a heavy hitter, muscle for the Syndicate. He's got his own room. Here's I'll point it out on your map.
TIH00000711	In case you're wondering, I don't know you, and you don't know me. Don't speak to me again, and never mention my name in this.

TIH00000714	Baby, you are speaking my language.
TIH00000715	You need to speak with Tony Chase up in Gomorrah. He'll tell you.
TIH00000716	Now it's time for that exchange you spoke of...
TIH00000717	All I need is a location, and in return... well, a good businessman like you wouldn't turn it down.
TIH00000718	aaInheritance01HastingsFindZimmerExchange
TIH00000719	If you don't mind a little blood on your hands, we could come to an agreement.
TIH00000720	My problem... is a bounty hunter who's been tracking me for weeks. His name is Vaughn, he's like a fucking bloodhound, won't give up.
TIH00000721	I'm safe in the Thorn, but outside he could take a free shot at me. This is hurting my business, and making me a little more than paranoid.
TIH00000722	Take care of this guy, and I'll help you find Zimmer. Deal?
TIH00000723	I'm something of a problem solver. Perhaps I can help you out, and then you can talk about Zimmer.
TIH00000724	I tend to kill people who offend me. Tell me about Zimmer before I get... upset.
TIH00000725	Fuck you and your delicate sensibilities!
TIH00000726	But hey - if you're feeling brave, make a move. You'll bring the whole Thorn down on you. Do what you feel.
TIH00000727	Fine, I'll take care of him.
TIH00000728	Good. I don't care if he leaves town or has an... "accident" - just make sure he won't fuck with me or my clients.
TIH00000729	I'm not going to do your dirty work.
TIH00000730	Your choice, Courier. But you've got a chance in fuck of finding Zimmer without my help.
TIH00000731	Nevermind, I should get going.
TIH00000732	...
TIH00000733	You need to forget about the bounty on Hastings. Leave Westside, now.
TIH00000734	So, Hastings is getting nervous? Sends the local badass to scare me off.
TIH00000735	Won't work. If I gave up every time some mark sent thugs to try and intimidate me... I'd be broke.
TIH00000736	aaInheritance01VaughnSpeech
TIH00000737	What? Fuck me! I've been tracking that asshole for two months. Now I've got to pack up and head to Bullhead City? Fuck this place.
TIH00000738	<Lie> You already missed your chance. Hastings just left for Bullhead City.
TIH00000739	Please. Those junkies are on their last leg. Some asshole named Randall cleaned them out.
TIH00000740	You know, the Fiends would love to get their hands on a bounty hunter...
TIH00000741	Leave Westside and never come back, or I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
TIH00000742	You know, I was just on my way out of here.
TIH00000743	I'm carrying a .44 magnum, and you're going to threaten me with a knife? Shut the fuck up.
TIH00000744	Here's an offer - leave or I'll, uh... cut meticulously around... your abdominal region!
TIH00000745	Hastings is offering me information on Zimmer. Can you do better?
TIH00000746	I've been tracking Hastings for months... believe me, he doesn't come close to Zimmer.
TIH00000747	However, he does meet up with an outfit man, someone higher up the food chain. I suppose he might know this Zimmer guy you're after.
TIH00000748	I'll raise the stakes -  If you kill Hastings, bring back his finger... I'll tell you where this contact is, and throw in... 250 caps.
TIH00000749	This way it works to both our benefit. So that's my offer - I'll leave it up to you whether or not to act on it.
TIH00000750	I need to get going.
TIH00000751	...
TIH00000752	Pack your shit and leave, hillbilly. Hastings doesn't want you around.
TIH00000753	So, Hastings is getting nervous? Sends the local badass to scare me off.
TIH00000754	Won't work. If I gave up every time some mark sent thugs to try and intimidate me... I'd be broke.
TIH00000755	Hastings is dead. Here's the finger.
TIH00000756	I never quite understood this part of the trade. It's one of those traditions, I guess... pretty sick if you ask me.
TIH00000757	But this is no time to complain - thanks for stepping up and taking care of this for me. Here's the caps I promised.
TIH00000758	As for the contact... I know that Hastings will meet with a Syndicate man, guy named Tony Chase, up in Gomorrah.
TIH00000759	He's probably the man to tell you about Zimmer. Good luck getting it out of him, though. I heard he's a gorilla - likes to use his hands.
TIH00000760	You watch your back, kid. You could've dealt me a shit hand here, but you came through. Good luck getting whatever it is you're after.
TIH00000761	Vaughn won't be a problem anymore.
TIH00000762	I already got word. Thanks.
TIH00000763	Look, I don't know Zimmer. Never even met him. But, I know a guy who can tell you. His name is Chase. He's shacked up in Gomorrah.
TIH00000764	Chase is a heavy hitter, muscle for the Syndicate. He's got his own room. Here's I'll point it out on your map.
TIH00000765	In case you're wondering, I don't know you, and you don't know me. Don't speak to me again, and never mention my name in this.
TIH00000766	aaInheritance01ChaseIntro01
TIH00000767	Come in, make yourself comfortable. There's no strangers on the third floor.
TIH00000768	Besides, it will be nice to have some company. The Omertas, you know, gave us the whole floor, so it gets a bit lonely up here.
TIH00000769	What's to keep us from taking all the loot?
TIH00000770	Besides the fact that I can fumigate the vault with nerve gas? Well, you'll find it difficult to access the various chambers with your keys.
TIH00000771	Your keys opened the arsenal itself. My keys, however, provide access to... whatever is inside those vaults. Sellers didn't mention that, did he?
TIH00000772	See, when the good Mr. Sellers made that arrangement with us so long ago, he provided part of the access cards, but shrewdly kept the others.
TIH00000773	Everyone consented, knowing full well that neither side could easily rip off the other... Sellers had other plans, it seems.
TIH00000774	<Remain Silent>
TIH00000775	Oh, one of those, are you? You imagine yourself the strong, silent type? In my experience, it's a fucking rarity.
TIH00000776	Most of the mutes I've known are idiots or psychopaths. Of course, you have to consider our working environment.
TIH00000777	I'm gonna get to the point, kid. What the hell are you doing here? Is this about Zimmer? The loot? I thought we had an agreement.
TIH00000778	I'm &PCName;, pleased to meet you.
TIH00000779	Likewise. That name of yours isn't exactly what I was expecting. Funny how expectations don't always correspond to, you know, reality.
TIH00000780	Now I'm gonna get to the point, kid. What the hell are you doing here? Is this about Zimmer? The loot? I thought we had an agreement.
TIH00000781	I'd prefer to keep that to myself.
TIH00000782	Alright, fair enough. It wasn't anything diabolical. I already know more about you than you may realize.
TIH00000783	We've been keeping tabs on you since you crawled out of that grave.
TIH00000784	Now I'm gonna get to the point, kid. What the hell are you doing here? Is this about Zimmer? The loot? I thought we had an agreement.
TIH00000785	I'm &PCName;, and I'm the last person you'll ever see if you don't tell me what I want to know.
TIH00000786	Whoa, whoa, whoa, just take it down a notch, alright. We're not making a fuckin Western here.
TIH00000787	You may be scaring those pissant raiders and shitkickers in the wasteland, but don't try that bullshit on me.
TIH00000788	I'm gonna get to the point, kid. What the hell are you doing here? Is this about Zimmer? The loot? I thought we had an agreement.
TIH00000789	I want that stash. Zimmer shouldn't have taken it.
TIH00000790	Heh, if all else fails, you can always count on greed.
TIH00000791	It can only end two ways. Either you walk away, or you get buried in the fucking desert again, and this time... you don't come back.
TIH00000792	You've got heart, kid. But that ain't enough. You don't realize what you're up against... you only think you do.
TIH00000793	Zimmer fucked himself when he played with my life. I'm nobody's puppet.
TIH00000794	That's just fucking dumb. We all answer to somebody, kid. Even Zimmer answers to... well, he answers to somebody you don't want to meet.
TIH00000795	It can only end two ways. Either you walk away, or you get buried in the fucking desert again, and this time... you don't come back.
TIH00000796	You've got heart, kid. But that ain't enough. You don't realize what you're up against... you only think you do.
TIH00000797	Your organization had no right to kill Bradley. I intend to settle things with Zimmer.
TIH00000798	You realize how naive that sounds, don't you? How many have you killed? Dozens? Hundreds?
TIH00000799	It can only end two ways. Either you walk away, or you get buried in the fucking desert again, and this time... you don't come back.
TIH00000800	You've got heart, kid. But that ain't enough. You don't realize what you're up against... you only think you do.
TIH00000801	I hate the Syndicate. Reason enough?
TIH00000802	Plenty, but I think you used up all your luck when Benny popped you in the noggin. Acting on all that hate... it's a dangerous road, kiddo.
TIH00000803	It can only end two ways. Either you walk away, or you get buried in the fucking desert again, and this time... you don't come back.
TIH00000804	You've got heart, kid. But that ain't enough. You don't realize what you're up against... you only think you do.
TIH00000805	My reasons are my own.
TIH00000806	I thought you might say some shit like that. Hard to figure out what makes people tick.
TIH00000807	It can only end two ways. Either you walk away, or you get buried in the fucking desert again, and this time... you don't come back.
TIH00000808	You've got heart, kid. But that ain't enough. You don't realize what you're up against... you only think you do.
TIH00000809	Give me your word that the Syndicate will let this go, and I'll walk away.
TIH00000810	You have my word. This is the smart play, kid. You don't know us, we don't know you. Everything goes back to the way it was.
TIH00000811	I knew you'd do the right thing when the dust settled. Take care of yourself out there, pal.

TIH00000887	Patience. I know you're not that brash, otherwise you'd have come in lobbing grenades. You're smarter than that.
TIH00000888	I'm new to the Mojave, so I've made it a priority to familiarize myself with the history, politics... the players. Somehow your name keeps coming up.
TIH00000889	I've been wanting to meet you for some time, really. It's another reason I didn't gas you in that vault. It would've been unseemly.
TIH00000890	I knew that cowing you would be a challenge. Odds were that you would show up here.
TIH00000891	I was looking forward to this... a worthy opponent, an opportunity to make my own name, while letting you pass... with dignity.
TIH00000892	Who would cross "The man who killed Courier Six?" Has a ring to it, like one of those pre-war Western films.
TIH00000893	Let me guess - this is the part where you try to persuade me to walk away, right?
TIH00000894	Oh, no. We're well past that, Courier.
TIH00000895	I'm new to the Mojave, so I've made it a priority to familiarize myself with the history, politics... the players. Somehow your name keeps coming up.

TIH00000900	<Remain Silent>
TIH00000901	You are truly a disappointment. Here I was, ready to hold a lengthy conversation with the legendary Courier Six.
TIH00000902	I even had the boys clean this place up, thinking you might show up. And here you are, and you can't even summon a response.
TIH00000903	Funny how rumors depart from reality. I heard you were a loquacious sort - a convenient lie. You'll just have to be content listening to me.
TIH00000904	I'm new to the Mojave, so I've made it a priority to familiarize myself with the history, politics... the players. Somehow your name keeps coming up.

TIH00000909	Why are we even talking?
TIH00000910	I'm new to the Mojave, so I've made it a priority to familiarize myself with the history, politics... the players. Somehow your name keeps coming up.
TIH00000911	I've been wanting to meet you for some time, really. It's another reason I didn't gas you in that vault. It would've been unseemly.

TIH00000916	So, the mythical Courier is an imbecile. I've got to start lowering my expectations.
TIH00000917	You see, my employer has rewarded me for my service to the organization... I've done well. It's interesting what people do with wealth.
TIH00000918	Some invest... others blow it on booze, pussy, passing pleasure. Me... I buy implants. Not comfortable going in, but so good once they're settled.
TIH00000919	One of my implants regulates cardiovascular performance, and it's been tweaked, for a specific purpose.
TIH00000920	When I have it activated, it can operate as a sort of fail-deadly switch, connected to explosives and what not.
TIH00000921	Incidentally, I have the loot surrounded by high explosives. If I die, my implant will trigger enough C4 to bury every lick of gold in there.
TIH00000922	Maybe you don't care about the gold, and that's fine. But if you do, then listen closely.
TIH00000923	I will turn off my implant's signal if you agree to fight me on my terms - with  a katana. If you win, then you get the gold. Otherwise... nothing.
TIH00000924	Well, it's always nice to meet a fan. Can we get on with this?
TIH00000925	You... your organization... mean *nothing* to me.
TIH00000926	Now that's cutting deep, Courier. You've wounded me.
TIH00000927	You see, my employer has rewarded me for my service to the organization... I've done well. It's interesting what people do with wealth.
TIH00000928	Some invest... others blow it on booze, pussy, passing pleasure. Me... I buy implants. Not comfortable going in, but so good once they're settled.

TIH00000934	Fuck you.
TIH00000935	This meeting has been such... a letdown. I was expecting so much more from you.

TIH00000942	I will turn off my implant's signal if you agree to fight me on my terms - with  a katana. If you win, then you get the gold. Otherwise... nothing.
TIH00000943	I've killed worse than you, Zimmer. You think you're tougher than the Judge?
TIH00000944	Ha! I heard that story. The Judge... so you killed that towering pervert, good for you.
TIH00000945	The honorable Judge Richter, who spent his days frolicking with slave boys, playing "Guess what's under Uncle Touchy's top hat." Hardly impressive!
TIH00000946	Besides, that old pederass was past his prime. Who else? Fiends? Local Tough guys? I doubt you broke a sweat.

TIH00000954	You certainly went to a lot of trouble to get me down here.
TIH00000955	Perhaps, but I think it was worth it.

TIH00000963	If you want to kill me, why haven't you made your move?
TIH00000964	You think too little of me. At the very least, I wanted to give a proper introduction... look you in the eyes before I do you in.

TIH00000972	Why do you keep saying "My Employer?" Just say his name.
TIH00000973	I call him "My Employer" because to say his name is forbidden - an offense punishable by death.
TIH00000974	I am personally acquainted with him. He trained me in the exquisite art of the samurai sword. I am his greatest pupil.
TIH00000975	<Remain Silent>
TIH00000976	Cocksucker!
TIH00000977	This ain't feudal Japan, and you ain't Musashi. I'm going to cut your goddamn head off.
TIH00000978	You have exceeded my expectations. I'll store your weapons in a nearby locker. I've got the key on my person, in the off chance you best me.
TIH00000979	You'll be using this katana. Let's go somewhere with a little more room...
TIH00000980	Fine, I'll fight you on your terms.
TIH00000981	Very well. I'll store your weapons in a nearby locker. I've got the key on my person, in the off chance you best me.
TIH00000982	You'll be using this katana. Let's go somewhere with a little more room...
TIH00000983	I don't care about the money. I just want to watch you bleed out. <Attack>
TIH00000984	Then by all means, let the bleeding begin!
TIH00000985	You and your employer can fuck yourselves.
TIH00000986	Wrong answer.
TIH00000987	aaInheritance01ZimmerFINALESpeech
TIH00000988	You know what would happen to me? My employer would kill my entire family... if I had one. This thing, it's all I've got. I don't have anyone.
TIH00000989	Maybe I do need to start over, turn away from it. I can't go back to Reno. Maybe I'll go south.
TIH00000990	Here, take this. I won't need it where I'm going. Sayonara, Courier.
TIH00000991	The Mojave is a dead end for you. Your only choice is to walk away - leave this life behind you.
TIH00000992	Maybe we could... but action... feels so much better than words right now.
TIH00000993	Let's talk this out. Maybe we can reach an agreement.
TIH00000994	aaInheritance01ZimmerFINALEIntelligence
TIH00000995	Do you know how many self-proclaimed badasses I've killed? How are you any different?
TIH00000996	I'm not afraid to die, Courier. I respect God, but I don't count on his help.
TIH00000997	I know my end, and I'm at peace with it. The real question is whether or not you realize where you're headed.
TIH00000998	It doesn't matter how many badasses you kill, how tough you think you are. One day you'll make a mistake, be negligent, or just get old.
TIH00000999	I like reading old books, pre-war stuff. Ever heard of Bill Hickock? Killed all sorts of people in his day.
TIH00001000	You know how he died? It wasn't some grand duel in the street, an epic showdown with a worthy opponent.
TIH00001001	Some dreg, a bottom-feeding asshole, just walked into a saloon and popped Hickock in the back of the head. Payback for killing his brother.
TIH00001002	If you're lucky, Courier... you'll die here, with a sword in your hand, killed by a proper foe.
TIH00001003	You might get old, die in your bed. But more than likely some punk will wait until you're drunk, high, or just distracted. Then they'll strike.
TIH00001004	A warrior's death is the best you can hope for, and I'm offering it.
TIH00001005	aaInheritance01ZimmerStartDuel
TIH00001006	Defend yourself.
TIH00001007	<Remain Silent>
TIH00001008	I'll assume that is the sound of due rumination, and that your consent is implicit. Though, I don't care if you consent or not.
TIH00001009	I'm not going to participate in your twisted contest.
TIH00001010	Something tells me Bradley might feel differently. Nothing like that survival instinct to alter someone's character.
TIH00001011	Goodbye, Courier. I trust we'll never speak of this again.
TIH00001012	I'm going to eat your fucking heart, you sniveling cunt.
TIH00001013	Easy, Courier. I've got a Fiend up here with delicate sensibilities. We wouldn't want to offend him, right?
TIH00001014	Why don't you save all that aggression and angst for Mr. Bradley?
TIH00001015	I'm sorry too, Bradley.
TIH00001016	I'll see you on the other side, Courier.
TIH00001017	Let's do this. I'm sick of hearing you whine like a little bitch.
TIH00001018	You just made this a lot easier.
TIH00001019	That's goddamn right. I'm going out on my terms. Just promise me you'll reckon with these fucks.
TIH00001020	I was saving this Mother Darkness for a special occasion. Seems like as good a time as any. See you around, Courier.
TIH00001021	Don't do this, Bradley. He wants us to fight like caged animals. We're better than that.
TIH00001022	No, I'm not going to get gassed like a fucking insect. I'd rather go out with a weapon in my hands. Sorry, Courier.
TIH00001023	Put down the weapon, Bradley. We can find a way out of this.
TIH00001024	<Reputation Check>
TIH00001025	Listen to me. That fuck on the intercom wants us to fight like gladiators, dogs... I won't give him the satisfaction.
TIH00001026	But... after everything I've done, I've got it coming. You can do this... no, you have to do this.
TIH00001027	Just promise me... swear... that you'll settle with these fucks. You'll do that, won't you?
TIH00001028	Do it before I change my mind. I'll see you on the other side, friend.
TIH00001029	[Reputation] I'm not going to do this, Bradley.
TIH00001030	I'll see you on the other side, Courier.
TIH00001031	Let's get this over with.
TIH00001032	<Remain Silent>
TIH00001033	You're a cold fuck, aren't you? Goodbye, Courier.
TIH00001034	I'm here because of what you did to Bradley.
TIH00001035	What I did? It's fair to say that you did the... doing.
TIH00001036	Maybe... we can flip a coin?
TIH00001037	Pretty fucking twisted, but that makes the most sense right now.
TIH00001038	I always kept a Legion Denarius in my pocket, thinking it was good luck. Never thought it would be used like this.
TIH00001039	Call it. Heads or tails?
TIH00001040	Heads.
TIH00001041	Let's see...
TIH00001042	Caesar's ugly mug... I should've know it would screw me.
TIH00001043	But if you can't abide a coin toss, I suppose nothing is sacred. At least that laughing fucker won't get the pleasure of watching us fight.
TIH00001044	Whatever you do, just promise me you'll reckon with them. We didn't deserve this.
TIH00001045	I was saving this Mother Darkness for a special occasion. Seems like as good a time as any. See you around, Courier.
TIH00001046	Tails.
TIH00001047	Let's see...
TIH00001048	And it's the three stooges. I should've known they would fuck me.
TIH00001049	But if you can't abide a coin toss, I suppose nothing is sacred. At least that laughing fucker won't get the pleasure of watching us fight.
TIH00001050	Whatever you do, just promise me you'll reckon with them. We didn't deserve this.

TIH00001059	What message?
TIH00001060	My employer says that the initial harassers were just the first, designed to test you. I am here... to end you. To end this.
TIH00001061	I will return your head to him, and it will be mounted on the wall... a trophy to the futility of defiance. That is my message.
TIH00001062	I'm going to rip your guts out and put them in a briefcase. Then I'll deliver it to your boss.

TIH00001084	Fuck off.
TIH00001085	Right back at you.
TIH00001086	To hell with this. You need to learn to solve your own problems.
TIH00001087	You'd throw away a boy's life, just on some selfish impulse? What the hell is wrong with you?
TIH00001088	Get out of my sight, you worthless cunt. Westside is better off without you.
TIH00001089	You'd throw away a boy's life, just on some selfish impulse? What the hell is wrong with you?
TIH00001090	Get out of my sight, you worthless cunt. Westside is better off without you.
TIH00001091	Wait, they want 50,000 caps from me? That's my money!
TIH00001092	No shit. Look, we've been trying to get donations from the citizens, and we've managed to get some caps for you.
TIH00001093	It's not much, but it should help ease the burden on your pockets. We want you to know that we're with you in this, it ain't just your problem.
TIH00001094	What are my options?
TIH00001095	Don't even think about going in there like some gunslinging cowboy.
TIH00001096	This is a hair-trigger bunch of lunatics led by some cannibal, calls himself Chester. Chester... even the name sounds twisted.
TIH00001097	They say that you are to show up with 50,000 caps in hand, no questions asked. If you show up with 49,999, they kill the kid.
TIH00001098	If you try to ninja your ass in there, they'll blow the kid to high hell. It's a thick shit sandwich, and you're going to have to bite into it.
TIH00001099	I'd say show up with the caps, but see if you can talk out a compromise, maybe even get them to release the kid for free.
TIH00001100	They're crazier than ever, but they were starting to thin out. The problem with paying is that they'll use those caps to buy dope and get re-armed.
TIH00001101	That's the damnable thing, Courier. Everyone wants to see that child returned safely, but goddamn, if the Fiends get that kind of money...
TIH00001102	They'd squeeze the life out of Westside.
TIH00001103	Why isn't the militia doing anything?
TIH00001104	Have you seen the militia? They're useless enough as it is, but you expect them to undertake a hostage rescue? They're not rangers.
TIH00001105	Fine, I'll do it.
TIH00001106	Thank you. Just remember one thing - do not show up without the caps.
TIH00001107	Those junkies are paranoid enough when they're strung out, but right now they're out of their minds.
TIH00001108	If you don't deliver, they'll probably assume it's a trap. Please, just do everything in your power to keep that boy alive. Good luck.
TIH00001109	Did you just imply that I shouldn't pay the ransom?
TIH00001110	No, I'm telling you to do everything you can to save that boy, but remember what's at stake if those Fiends get the money.
TIH00001111	Thank you. I'll put them to good use. <Take the caps>
TIH00001112	This is everything we have, Courier. Please make sure that boy is safe.
TIH00001113	Tell the citizens thank you, but keep the caps. I'll cover the cost myself.
TIH00001114	That's... that's very large of you, Courier. None of us expected you to carry the burden yourself. This will help us more than you know.
TIH00001115	Alright, here are the caps. <Give 50,000 caps>
TIH00001116	Hell yeah!
TIH00001117	But you better tell those Westside bitches that next time we won't be so patient. Kid's in the next room.
TIH00001118	Don't think about trying anything while we ease out of here. That detonator has a longer range than you think.
TIH00001119	Otherwise, it's been a pleasure doing business with you.  C'mon boys, we're about to go on a little shopping spree.
TIH00001120	aaInheritancePost05ChesterCharisma
TIH00001121	Bullshit. The Fiends are stronger than ever. Nobody fucks with us. Now give me the fucking caps.
TIH00001122	Holding kids for ransom... seems like the Fiends are desperate these days, huh?
TIH00001123	What? That's bullshit, you're talking right out of your ass. I never heard anything like that.
TIH00001124	Hurting kids is going to make the NCR double down on you. Do you really want bounty hunters around?
TIH00001125	aaInheritancePost05ChesterSpeech
TIH00001126	That was a bounty hunter? Look, I just want to get high, I don't want that kind of drama.
TIH00001127	Here, we'll let the kid go. Just tell them... tell them it was a mix-up. We don't want no fucking bounties on us.
TIH00001128	Kid's in the next room, safe and sound. Uh, we better get going, I've got some, uh...
TIH00001129	Motor-Runner and the rest are dead. Hurt that child and the next bounty will be on your head.
TIH00001130	There's always somebody else willing to step up, they were just weak. With this cash, It's gonna be my time to shine.
TIH00001131	Your leaders are all dead. Can't you see that the Fiends are finished?
TIH00001132	aaInheritancePost05ChesterBarter
TIH00001133	That's fucking crazy! They're like family, why... you know... actually, they are pretty goddamn shitty, aren't they? Ok, let's make 25k.
TIH00001134	If you walk out of here with 50,000 caps, the other Fiends will eat you alive to get a share of it.
TIH00001135	I told you not to fuck with us on the exchange. I won't warn you again.
TIH00001136	Hold on, can't we work out a payment plan or something? Let's put the kid on layaway.
TIH00001137	I don't have enough caps to pay the ransom.
TIH00001138	What? I know what you're doing... this is some kind of a setup, isn't it? Well fuck that!
TIH00001139	I didn't come here to negotiate. I came here to make you bleed.
TIH00001140	Looky here boys, we got ourselves a badass!
TIH00001141	I'm not paying the ransom.
TIH00001142	Well, I ain't about to let you live. How about them apples, bitch?
TIH00001143	<Free him>
TIH00001144	...
TIH00001145	<Do Nothing>
TIH00001146	...
TIH00001147	I paid the ransom and the kid is safe.
TIH00001148	Hell of a thing you did, putting up that money for little Chris. I want you to know that all of Westside appreciates it.
TIH00001149	And don't you worry about Chris. We take care of our own. He's a touch quiet, but I think he'll be fine. Kids can be really resilient.
TIH00001150	I wish there were more like you, courier. I can't offer you money, but I do have a little something the Syndicate goons left behind.
TIH00001151	I was considering pawning it off, but I think you'd get better use out of it. You take care of yourself, Courier. We won't forget you.
TIH00001152	I paid the ransom and the kid is safe.
TIH00001153	Fiends? Talked down? You aren't doing Jet, are you? Hell, that's better than I expected. You're really something special, aren't you?
TIH00001154	I want you to know that all of Westside appreciates it. We don't know how you did it, but you did it nonetheless.
TIH00001155	And don't you worry about Chris. We take care of our own. He's a touch quiet, but I think he'll be fine. Kids can be really resilient.
TIH00001156	I wish there were more like you, courier. I can't offer you money, but I do have a little something the Syndicate goons left behind.
TIH00001157	I was considering pawning it off, but I think you'd get better use out of it. You take care of yourself, Courier. We won't forget you.
TIH00001158	I want to ask you something.
TIH00001159	What do want to know?
TIH00001160	Who are you?
TIH00001161	Sean Bradley. Never had a middle name, and after my time in the service I didn't have much use for the first one.
TIH00001162	How can I best make use of your skills?
TIH00001163	I'm a rifleman by trade, so I fight best from a distance. I'm also trained in hand-to-hand, groundfighting and what not. I Never used knives.
TIH00001164	Craziest thing was when I got caught unarmed by a feral ghoul, big motherfucker. He tried to rip my throat out, so I applied a triangle choke.
TIH00001165	I mean, it worked... but rest assured you don't want a feral's gaping maw that close to your balls. Guns are... so much better.
TIH00001166	Where are you from?
TIH00001167	New Reno... it's one hell of a town. Maybe not as big as Vegas, but damn it's wild.
TIH00001168	I miss it, even with the drama between the families. Not sure if I'll ever get to go back, though.
TIH00001169	How did you end up in New Vegas?
TIH00001170	You mentioned time in the service. Why did you leave the military?
TIH00001171	Well, let's just say I had an abrupt and unceremonious departure from the NCR's armed forces. Leave it at that.
TIH00001172	Besides, this vocation affords a bit more freedom than one enjoys as a grunt, not to mention the pay - there's no comparison.
TIH00001173	What was it like growing up in Reno?
TIH00001174	My mom died when I was... four or five. After that I was on my own, living on the streets for a few years. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
TIH00001175	I developed a talent for pickpocketing tourists, and that got me by till I was about nine or so. Then one day I pickpocketed the wrong guy.
TIH00001176	He was a made man, one of the Mordinos. Caught me going after his pocket watch. Damn near beat me to death on the street.
TIH00001177	I didn't make a noise, though. Wouldn't give that cocksucker the satisfaction. Apparently one of the Bishops saw it and liked my moxy.
TIH00001178	They got me patched up and took me under their wing, got me distributing Jet. That's the big moneymaker out there.
TIH00001179	I turned into a pretty good dealer, had a a solid reputation with the Bishops. If I had stuck around, who knows? I might have gotten made.
TIH00001180	But, like a lot of things, I fucked it up. When I was 16... young, dumb, and full of cum... I ran into that Mordino fucker again.
TIH00001181	We were in a bar, and he popped off about that beating he laid on me, tried to embarass me in front of everyone. I ignored it... for a while.
TIH00001182	I waited till he went in the bathroom, then I put him in a chokehold. He started crying, pissing himself. Then I strangled him till he went limp.
TIH00001183	But... you can't off a made guy and expect nobody to notice. I had to leave town. Mr. Bishop said he couldn't protect me in the city anymore.
TIH00001184	So I drifted west with a caravan, until I saw a recruiting office. When you're starving and homeless, three hots and a cot is a damn good deal.
TIH00001185	Have you ever thought about settling down?
TIH00001186	It never suited me. Besides, that would mean getting married, and there was only ever one real woman in my life, and she's long gone.
TIH00001187	aaInheritance01BradleyBARKFiendAttack01
TIH00001188	Fuck! Fiends from the west!
TIH00001189	aaBARKLinusEntrance
TIH00001190	Fuck me, I hate caves. Dark, full of critters waiting to bite your nuts off. God, this place smells like... burnt piss.
TIH00001191	aaBARKLinusBrahminHunter
TIH00001192	Now what in the fuck is this? Huh, three steaks and a sniper rifle - that's what I want at my funeral.
TIH00001193	aaBARKLinusRobots
TIH00001194	No survivors, naturally. Thanks, pops! Nothing I like more than traipsing into a tomb filled with crazed robots!
TIH00001195	aaBarkLambdaEntrance
TIH00001196	Whoa, no skeletal remains or batshit robots? Place looks like it's held up pretty well. Maybe dad was looking out for me after all.
TIH00001197	aaBARKLambda02
TIH00001198	Fuck my life. Thanks a lot, dad! Here, son. This is a key to a death trap full of fuckall ways to die.
TIH00001199	aaInheritance01BradleyBARKFiendAttack02
TIH00001200	More inbound from that house! Light em up!
TIH00001201	aaInheritance01BradleyBARKFiendAttack03
TIH00001202	Oh, fuck...
TIH00001203	There's a fuckload inbound from the west! Use cover and make your shots count!
TIH00001204	aaBARKSuicideSkeletons
TIH00001205	Motherfucker. I guess they opted out.
TIH00001206	aaBARKRats
TIH00001207	Ok, if the rats did all this, my opinion of the entire Enclave just went to shit.
TIH00001208	aaBARKZombies
TIH00001209	I think we can rule out rats as the culprit. I hope you brought Rad-X. Goddamn zombies. Fuck my life.
TIH00001210	aaBARKBallarms
TIH00001211	Hey, I might have seen that flick. Had that guy with the moustache... Doctor... something. It was some kind of sci-fi musical. Fucking weird.
TIH00001212	What's your opinion of the NCR?
TIH00001213	Good people, bad fucking leadership. Kimball's ok, but the Senate? Bunch of money-grubbing fat cats, paid off by miners and cattlemen.
TIH00001214	It's the same in the military. Oliver is fucking useless. Too many of the officers got their rank by playing politics, not from combat experience.
TIH00001215	It seems to me like we were damn lucky at Hoover Dam. I wouldn't count on that luck to hold two times in a row.
TIH00001216	But if we can win at Zulu, maybe we can hold out at the Dam. Either way, I don't plan on being anywhere near here when the music starts.
TIH00001217	What's your opinion of Caesar's Legion?
TIH00001218	I spent most of my career chasing down raiders and slavers. From what I hear the Legion is the same thing... just on a bigger scale.
TIH00001219	They're no better than most of those other savages outside the NCR. They have organization and discipline, but not much else.
TIH00001220	But to be fair, sometimes organization and discipline are enough. The NCR tends to forget that, and just focuses on fielding warm bodies.
TIH00001221	I know one thing - we sure as fuck better not underestimate them.
TIH00001222	What's your opinion of Mr. House?
TIH00001223	There are so many bullshit rumors, I don't know what to think of him. Some ranger told me House drinks his own piss and lives in a test tube.
TIH00001224	I've also heard stories of airships, talking deathclaws, and other nonsense. I tend to be skeptical of these stories. House is in the same category.
TIH00001225	I'd like to ask you something else.
TIH00001226	What is it?
TIH00001227	I don't have any more questions right now.
TIH00001228	Ok, let's get going.
TIH00001229	zBradleyMilitaryWhatHappened
TIH00001230	You're not going to let up, are you?
TIH00001231	I spent fifteen years in the infantry, was five away from my pension. I was a Staff Sergeant when I fucked it all up in Bullhead.
TIH00001232	I was with General... President Kimball's expeditionary force.
TIH00001233	It wasn't the toughest fighting I'd seen, but we were pushing hard, getting leaner on supplies and manpower as we pushed ahead.
TIH00001234	Somebody told me the first casualty of war is innocence, and that's absolute bullshit. The first casualty is fucking sleep.
TIH00001235	Marching, setting up camp, running night reconnaissance, firewatch, all these things mean next to no shuteye for the rank and file.
TIH00001236	The point is that my guys were wearing out, and I needed them alert. A dozing sentry can get an entire platoon killed.
TIH00001237	So I... reconnect with a few old contacts and managed to scrounge up some Jet. I thought it would be a stop-gap solution, something temporary.
TIH00001238	Wrong. Before I knew it half the squad was hooked, so even when I stopped distributing it the damage was done.
TIH00001239	Don't get me wrong, it did some good. It may have saved some lives in the final push when some of those boys were running on adrenaline.
TIH00001240	But when the smoke cleared and we settled in, they were still fiending. Things went downhill pretty quick, and the brass wanted heads to roll.
TIH00001241	They were threatening every NCO in the company... hell, the entire division. It started with me, so I jumped on that grenade.
TIH00001242	Only reason they didn't line me up in front of a firing squad was because of my combat record. Instead, I got ten years in the brig. I did five.
TIH00001243	One of my old NCO's, a man named Lancaster, did me a solid in the trial, testifying on my behalf. I'm not sure what became of him.
TIH00001244	So there I was, dishonorably discharged, no pension, no real work skills outside fighting... I was a ready-made merc.
TIH00001245	I'm not trying to break balls, but I'd like to know why you left the service. It doesn't add up.
TIH00001246	I said to leave it alone, and I damn well meant it.
TIH00001247	Were you a section 8 or something? Are you going to have a flashback and snap? I need to know!
TIH00001248	Who did you fight against during your time in the NCR's military?
TIH00001249	I fought a lot of fucking boredom, that's for damn sure. Jokes aside, it was mainly small bands of raiders, bandits, or slavers.
TIH00001250	I gotta admit, there were few things more gratifying than freeing slaves. It's an awful state... slavers treat people worse than their dogs.
TIH00001251	Maybe that's why I despise the Legion. I hear they have a giant slave camp off in Arizona, mining metal for weapons. Hundreds of slaves there.
TIH00001252	But I digress - most of the raiders were just small bands until the 80's came along. Those fuckers are a rough bunch, and they're growing.
TIH00001253	I ran into a few White Legs, also the Claws. Those crazy fucks drink Deathclaw blood, wear claws on gloves. They can gut you in a second.
TIH00001254	But, most of the maniacs I fought were just murdering slobs camped in the desert, nothing special. There's a lot of them on the frontier.
TIH00001255	Christ, you really want to hear this stuff? Ok.
TIH00001256	The woman... she was every bit a woman - was a good bit older than me when I met her. I was 16, when everything you feel is... magnified.
TIH00001257	Her name was Jessica Wright, married to some bigshot in the Wright family. It was freak luck meeting her, really.
TIH00001258	She had an arrangement with the Bishops, where they'd secretly deliver Jet, since her husband was a control freak.
TIH00001259	One of our guys was sick, and since I was the next slinger in line, young Bradley got the job of delivering Jet to Mrs. Wright.
TIH00001260	I remember seeing her the first time, in that black dress. She had dark skin and eyes, and those hips... Jesus, I can almost feel them.
TIH00001261	Maybe it was just good timing, but we "connected" right away. It was like nothing I had felt before... and nothing since.
TIH00001262	Jess was the sort of woman who could put crazy thoughts in your head with just a look... not to mention her touch. Jesus, she was amazing.
TIH00001263	I had dumb dreams about killing her husband, marrying her. She was the focus of my youth, my passion. Maybe I left it all with her.
TIH00001264	When I had to leave Reno, I wrote her a letter, asking if she'd go with me. She never wrote back. I figured she had moved on.
TIH00001265	Being in the military, always in camp or on campaign, I tried to forget about her. I had more than my share of whores, but it wasn't the same.
TIH00001266	Funny thing is that after all this time, I mostly remember Jess' smell. That perfume, her hair. Not a day goes by that I don't think of her.
TIH00001267	Who was this woman you mentioned? Seems like you have strong feelings about her.
TIH00001268	Some things are best left in the past... in memories, not words. I hope you learn that someday.
TIH00001269	Hold on - tell me about the woman. I want details.
TIH00001270	Have you ever thought about going back to Reno and finding her?
TIH00001271	That was... almost 25 years ago. I'm sure she's moved on. I should have done the same long ago.
TIH00001272	Some things are best left in the past. You can't blame yourself for someone else's choices.
TIH00001273	Maybe you're right. When you're detached from something for so long, it's easy to let nostalgia skew your perception.
TIH00001274	She made her choices, I made mine. It's just that simple.
TIH00001275	You should forget about that hussy. There are other fish in the sea, muchacho.
TIH00001276	Watch your fucking mouth. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
TIH00001277	aaASKWhatFindInHere01
TIH00001278	Hey, can I ask you a question?
TIH00001279	Sure, what's on your mind?
TIH00001280	I'm not sure how I feel about this whole thing. Honestly, what do you think we'll find in here? I'm tempted just to leave it alone.
TIH00001281	No, we should keep moving.
TIH00001282	You're probably right. Lead the way.
TIH00001283	Nothing ventured, nothing gained. You can't be meek in the face of danger, Bradley.
TIH00001284	Hey, who the fuck are you calling meek?
TIH00001285	Alright, I'm right behind you. But if Deathclaws lop our faces off I'm going to remind you I was right.
TIH00001286	If you don't have the nerve, I'll be happy to go it out alone and keep everything to myself.
TIH00001287	I'm not going anywhere. I wanted to see where you stood, and you just let me know. Let's get moving.
TIH00001288	I don't know what's in there, but we're going to find out together. Good enough?
TIH00001289	Absolutely. I just wanted to see where you stood. That told me what I needed to know.
TIH00001290	aaASKMoneyIntro
TIH00001291	Hey, can I ask you a question?
TIH00001292	Sure, what is it?
TIH00001293	I wasn't sure if we'd find anything, and now that we're here, I can't help but think of what's going to happen afterwards.
TIH00001294	For the sake of discussion... let's say we walk out of that place filthy rich... like Sierra Madre rich. What are you going to do with your cut?
TIH00001295	No, we're almost to the vault. Let's keep moving.
TIH00001296	Yeah, you're right. I've got your back.
TIH00001297	It's a little early to start discussing our hypothetical wealth. Let's focus on getting it first.
TIH00001298	You're right. Normally I'm focused on the job, but finding this... something left by my dad. I can't help but smile at the thought of it.
TIH00001299	I was thinking of using the money to help Freeside.
TIH00001300	No offense, but they can fend for themselves. I've walked that road, living in the gutter, eating rats and barely surviving.
TIH00001301	Besides, you throw cash at Freeside and the end result... the Kings are carrying new guns and wearing new suits. Nothing changes.
TIH00001302	This isn't about the money. It's about finishing the job.
TIH00001303	It's always about the money. If you want to lie to yourself... say it's not... that's your choice.
TIH00001304	What does it matter? You're just going to piss it away.
TIH00001305	Always gotta be the douchebag, don't you? I'm looking forward to the end of our little partnership.
TIH00001306	aaBARKLambdaBadFeeling
TIH00001307	You ever get that feeling in your stomach... makes you taste vomit in the back of your throat? That just happened to me.
TIH00001308	Thank you.
TIH00001309	Whatever.
TIH00001310	<Remain Silent>
TIH00001311	<The Courier stares at you>
TIH00001312	Fucking fascist.
TIH00001313	Fuck off.
TIH00001314	Fucking fascist.
TIH00001315	I'm &PCName;. You wanted to discuss building an orphanage, right?
TIH00001316	Oh, of course! I wasn't sure if you would respond.
TIH00001317	I've heard of you... how you took down the Syndicate, saved Westside from Fiends. I also heard you're... well off.
TIH00001318	Vegas is a town of haves and have-nots. I want to know if you'd be willing to help us give back to the less fortunate, give them a better shot.
TIH00001319	I already have the spot for the orphanage picked out, and Zeke can provide security. What I need... are caps. 10,000 caps, to be specific.
TIH00001320	Bitch, I got your letter. Find someone else to pay for those brats, and don't write me again.
TIH00001321	Why... you greedy piece of shit!
TIH00001322	Zeke, teach this slime a lesson in civility!
TIH00001323	God bless you!
TIH00001324	It's going to take us a few days to get the place set up, but feel free to swing by when we're up and running. I might even have work for you.
TIH00001325	This is a great service you're doing for New Vegas. We won't soon forget it.
TIH00001326	I'm happy to help. <Pay 10,000 caps>
TIH00001327	I understand. I still have business to manage here in Novac, so just speak with me when you have the caps collected.
TIH00001328	I want to help, but I'll need more time to get 10,000 caps together.
TIH00001329	Please, take your time. It's a lot of caps. We'll be here when you have it collected.
TIH00001330	I'm sorry, but I still don't have enough caps.
TIH00001331	Why should I trust you?
TIH00001332	I was an orphan myself. I know what it's like, struggling to survive, stealing just to stay alive.
TIH00001333	I've spent years just getting on my feet, working as a trader. For the first time, I'm in a position to help these children... to help New Vegas.
TIH00001334	I want to spare these children the hardships of living on the street. I can't do it alone, though. I need your help.
TIH00001335	I'm not going to finance your orphanage.
TIH00001336	Well, that's disappointing. Is there any particular reason?
TIH00001337	I wanted to speak with you about funding the orphanage.
TIH00001338	I was wondering if you'd say that.
TIH00001339	If this means helping the children of New Vegas, I'll raise the stakes. <Pay 20,000 caps>
TIH00001340	This is... I never expected.... thank you!
TIH00001341	It's going to take us a few days to get the place set up, but feel free to swing by when we're up and running. I might even have work for you.
TIH00001342	This is a great service you're doing for New Vegas. We won't soon forget it.
TIH00001343	10,000 caps?! Are you housing them at the Ultra-Luxe?
TIH00001344	I didn't pull that amount out of thin air. The NCR doesn't help worth squat, so me and Zeke have to get the ball rolling. Everything costs money.
TIH00001345	We have to get water, food, power, and extra security. Then there's the NCR permits and taxes. It takes green to cut through red tape.
TIH00001346	I've already got the building picked out - it's a place just east of the Medical Clinic. When we're set up, you can see for yourself.
TIH00001347	What's up with the mutant?
TIH00001348	He's a bodyguard of sorts. I bailed him out of some trouble a while back, so he took some kind of crazy blood oath to protect me.
TIH00001349	Not a big talker, but he's hell on wheels in any sort of rumble.
TIH00001350	My reasons are my own.
TIH00001351	That's unfortunate, but I respect your decision. Zeke and I will hit the road, I guess. We have a lot of money to raise.
TIH00001352	I don't trust you.
TIH00001353	You're smarter than I thought. I guess you didn't get that money by accident, did you?
TIH00001354	Farewell, Courier. Until our next meeting.
TIH00001355	I won't invest 10,000 caps in such a risky venture.
TIH00001356	If you only knew how much a difference it would make... how it would help those children, I think you'd reconsider.
TIH00001357	That's unfortunate, but I respect your decision. Zeke and I will hit the road I guess. We have a lot of money to raise.
TIH00001358	You strike me as an unctuous bitch.
TIH00001359	You've got some nerve...
TIH00001360	Fine. I'll find someone else with a sense of charity to help us. Keep your money and your judgment.
TIH00001361	I don't like your face.
TIH00001362	Are you a child? That's the most petty, shallow thing I've ever heard!
TIH00001363	Fine. I'll find someone else with a sense of charity to help us. Keep your money and your judgment.
TIH00001364	What's with all the security?
TIH00001365	You would not believe... hobos and filthy Fiends are all over the place.
TIH00001366	I didn't want to take any risks that might jeopardize the children. The mercenaries work at a reduced rate, and Zeke... well, he's free.
TIH00001367	Where are all the orphans?
TIH00001368	Funny thing, we just found homes for over a dozen youngsters.
TIH00001369	Most of them were only here for a day or two. The Followers were really helpful in connecting us with good parents.
TIH00001370	I'm sure we'll have more in here soon. I've made sure to tell the Followers, Kings, and everyone else we're open now.
TIH00001371	What's in the basement?
TIH00001372	It's a mess right now - you should steer clear. We've got some cots and mattresses, and I'm working on setting up a classroom for the kids.
TIH00001373	A few more days and it will be fixed up real nice. It's a sight better than living on the street, that's for certain.
TIH00001374	Is there any way I can help out?
TIH00001375	You've done so much already, I hate to impose any further.
TIH00001376	We do appreciate it, but right now I think we're all set.
TIH00001377	aaInheritancePost06EstherOPPerception
TIH00001378	What? How...
TIH00001379	I don't like where this conversation is headed. I want you to leave. Now.
TIH00001380	You're lying to me.
TIH00001381	I know you've been using the Orphanage as a front for the slave trade, Esther.
TIH00001382	You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you?
TIH00001383	Look, is this a matter of money? Surely we can come to an agreement.
TIH00001384	And if you're thinking of making a move... don't. If you're the do-gooder type, the only way you'll save those kids is if you hear me out.
TIH00001385	I find out you've been peddling kiddies. I'm going to bleed you slowly, you heinous twat.
TIH00001386	Whoa, hold on. Just... be reasonable!
TIH00001387	Look, I understand you're angry, but stop and think for a moment. If you want your money... if you want to save those kids - you'll hear me out.
TIH00001388	You set up a slavery den with *my* money, and you hid it? I want my cut, right now.
TIH00001389	Ok, ok. Look, I can't be too careful these days, with the NCR and other abolitionist nuts running around.
TIH00001390	It seems like you're reasonable, though, so we'll work something out. Clearly, you deserve some... restitution.
TIH00001391	I'm only going to ask once: where's my money?
TIH00001392	I can get you your money, no questions asked. But before I do that, just hear me out on something.
TIH00001393	You can't exactly go the bank for a startup loan on a slavery ring. I could build a front, but I needed capital to get on my feet. You provided it.
TIH00001394	By any measure, you're now a shareholder. Instead of a lump sum, why not take a piece of the action each week?
TIH00001395	Look, if you're dead set on getting all the caps back right away, we can do that. But if you're smart, you'll stay on board with me.
TIH00001396	I'll run the business. You don't have to touch it or see it, unless something big comes up. In exchange, you get ten percent of the profits.
TIH00001397	So what's it gonna be, Courier? Are you in this for the long haul?
TIH00001398	What do you mean, save the kids? Where are they?
TIH00001399	I'll tell you, but first you have to give me your word - in exchange for the information, I'm going to walk out of here.
TIH00001400	You can still save them... the question is whether or not you're willing to put their lives ahead of your disdain for me.
TIH00001401	I'm going to break your spine and dump you over the dam. You'll be Lakelurk shit, you stupid cooze.
TIH00001402	Zeke! Mama needs you!
TIH00001403	[Taunt] You take orphans and enslave them? You're lower than rat shit, cunt. <Attack>
TIH00001404	...
TIH00001405	Bitch, I'm the do-bad type, and you just shit in my hat. Good-motherfucking-night. <Attack>
TIH00001406	Zeke, we got a fighter!
TIH00001407	You took my money to set this place up. That makes me a share-holder.
TIH00001408	I was wondering if you'd say that - it's good to know you've got a mind for business.
TIH00001409	Clearly you deserve a share of the profits. I can offer you a cut each week, no questions asked. The alternative is a lump sum buyout.
TIH00001410	The smart play... is to stay with us. At the rate we're going, you'll make your money back and then some. It's up to you.
TIH00001411	Ok, I'll take a share of the weekly profits.
TIH00001412	Very shrewd choice, if I may say so. As long as there are orphans, we will stay in the black.
TIH00001413	Just check in with me each week, and I'll have your share of the take. Aside from that, we should keep our contact to a minimum.
TIH00001414	We'll manage the business, acquisitions, everything. I'll only call on you if... complications arise. I'm not too worried about that, though.
TIH00001415	Thanks again, Courier. Take care of yourself.
TIH00001416	
TIH00001417	Fine. This is going to set me back more than you know, but you have a point.
TIH00001418	After this, we're done. My debt is paid, our business is finished. I think it's best if we avoided any contact in the future.
TIH00001419	I gave you a loan and you turned it into gold. You owe me points on top of the lump sum.
TIH00001420	Fine. This is going to set me back more than you know, but you have a point.
TIH00001421	After this, we're done. My debt is paid, our business is finished. I think it's best if we avoided any contact in the future.
TIH00001422	I gave you a loan and you turned it into gold. You owe me points on top of the lump sum.
TIH00001423	This wasn't exactly a loan. I had good reason for my methods. I'll settle my debt, but I'm not paying a cap more.
TIH00001424	Don't you owe me interest or something?
TIH00001425	I want the lump sum, right now.
TIH00001426	I had hoped you would opt for the long-term plan, but I respect your choice.
TIH00001427	Here it is, every last cap. That should conclude our business. I think it would be best if we avoided any contact in the future.
TIH00001428	I had hoped you would opt for the long-term plan, but I respect your choice.
TIH00001429	Here it is, every last cap. That should conclude our business. I think it would be best if we avoided any contact in the future.
TIH00001430	aaInheritancePost06EstherMONEYSumAndLeave
TIH00001431	You can leave unharmed if you tell me where the children are being held. I give you my word.
TIH00001432	The Vipers have them in their new hideout, east of Nipton. It's nothing more than an old cave, really.
TIH00001433	Supposedly they've gotten some new blood from outside the Mojave, real hardasses. They're going to sell the kids to the Legion.
TIH00001434	You're not a bad sort, Courier... you just see things a little too... black and white. Good luck to you.
TIH00001435	I won't agree to those terms. You have to pay for what you've done.
TIH00001436	Very well. Zeke?
TIH00001437	I keep a pair of pliers and a blowtorch handy. I bet I can make you talk.
TIH00001438	Maybe. But by the time I tell you, those kiddies will be sold to Caesar's Legion, never to be seen again.
TIH00001439	You can make a move, or go save those orphans. Time is wasting, so you better choose quickly.
TIH00001440	I don't care about the kids or the money. I just want to watch you die, bitch.
TIH00001441	Fucking psycho!
TIH00001442	I'd like to pick up my weekly cut.
TIH00001443	Sure, here you go.
TIH00001444	Sure, here you go.
TIH00001445	Sure, here you go.

TIH00001481	What are you doing out here?
TIH00001482	Trying to wait out those filthy hobos squatting on my property.
TIH00001483	Dirty bums don't give a damn about my deed, and the NCR won't send any law to force them out.
TIH00001484	Who are you?
TIH00001485	James Anderson. Most call me Jimmy. This is my wife, Jane, and children, Robert, Betty, and Billy.
TIH00001486	Why did you call it your property? It's an abandoned building.
TIH00001487	It was an abandoned building. An NCR inspector found it uninhabited, so they put it up for sale as part of the Homestead Initiative.
TIH00001488	My farm near Redding was about to go to the brahmin barons, so I put everything I had into this lot. Figured I could start a trading post.
TIH00001489	I bring my entire family and everything we have, only to find this place occupied by hobos.
TIH00001490	That Ronnie guy is their leader, and he won't budge. I'm getting desperate here, stranger. I might have to take matters into my own hands.
TIH00001491	I think it would be in your best interest to move on.
TIH00001492	Wait, you're supposed to be moving the hobos out of here! I bought and paid for this lot months ago. This is ridiculous! We're not going anywhere.
TIH00001493	Let me try to work something out with them.
TIH00001494	If you say so. The honcho is a loose cannon, real twitchy. I think they're on dope or mushrooms, something weird. Freaks, all of them.
TIH00001495	You get rid of them without any killing, and I'll throw in some caps for you. Thanks for doing this, stranger.
TIH00001496	I need to get going.
TIH00001497	See you later.
TIH00001498	Hobos? They're a disease, and the cure is in my holster. I'll take care of them.
TIH00001499	Cracking a few heads is one thing, but don't go killing people. I don't want bloodshed.

TIH00001518	But... I got mouths to feed. We've done every type of odd job out there, so some steady work might be good for us.
TIH00001519	Fine. You tell Anderson that we'll sign on so long as he keeps the wages fair and throws in some food for us every now and then.
TIH00001520	What if you and your people signed on to work for Mr. Anderson? Everyone would benefit.
TIH00001521	<Ronnie glares at you, clearly dismissing the idea>
TIH00001522	What if you split the property? You could keep the top floor, and they would live downstairs.

TIH00001526	You bring... 500 caps. Then we'll talk.

TIH00001535	I didn't really think about the food and what not. Figured we'd leach off Westside. Damn, I guess we'll have to keep moving on.
TIH00001536	You've got no food or water source, and Fiends are roaming outside. You sure you want to stay?
TIH00001537	We've been scrounging every which way for months. We'll find what we need. At least here there's a roof over our heads.

TIH00001542	I need to get going.

TIH00001544	I convinced Ronnie and the squatters to leave.

TIH00001546	I killed the squatters. This house is clean.
TIH00001547	Wait, they're all dead? God, they may have been hobos, but they sure as hell didn't deserve that!

TIH00001556	This is on the edge of the frontier. It's a dangerous place. Do you really want your family here?
TIH00001557	No, we sacrificed too much to get here. That building is our future, so help me God. Nothing you say will change that.

TIH00001567	The hell of it is that I will need manpower to get this place up and running. I just never imagined I'd be turning to hobos.

TIH00001573	Well, I didn't see that coming. I just assumed you were some hardass merc sent in here to give us the boot.
TIH00001574	If you can convince them to move on, we would have this place to ourselves. I don't have much to offer, but we'd be obliged to you.
TIH00001575	Whatever you do, don't get violent with them. Wiping out a family of NCR settlers would bring down a shitstorm from the government.
TIH00001576	Just lay some charm on them, see if they'll go. If you pull it off, we'll get some type of compensation together - I can promise you that.
TIH00001577	The Andersons have moved on. The building is yours.

TIH00001612	I'm here about the letter.
TIH00001613	Oh, it's you! I just... I pictured you differently, you know? I'm so glad you decided to meet with me.
TIH00001614	The letter gave a generalized view of what I'm trying to accomplish, but I'll give you some specifics.
TIH00001615	With the Syndicate gone, the Fiends are relying strictly on the Khans for their drugs, which means an uneven supply and price gouging.
TIH00001616	This has had a two-fold effect: some Fiends are becoming more radical in an attempt to finance their habit, while others... are trying to get clean.
TIH00001617	What I'd like to do... with your help... is to build a clinic near Westside that would offer rehabilitation services for the Fiends.
TIH00001618	We would also like to provide medical services to Westside residents, and host a halfway house for former Fiends trying to re-integrate into society.
TIH00001619	Over time, I believe that we can whittle away at the Fiends' ranks. Of course, this isn't going to pay for itself. That's where you come in.
TIH00001620	Alright, I'll help you.
TIH00001621	Thank you for this. We can talk money later. Right now the pressing issue is the site for the rehab center.
TIH00001622	It's an old building south of the Thorn. I've done some checking, and neither Westside, the NCR, or anyone else has a stake in it.
TIH00001623	From what I hear, even the Fiends won't go inside. When I heard that, it got me wondering. It could be tribal superstition... or something else.
TIH00001624	So, when you get a chance, please scout out the property and see what's behind those rumors. It's probably nothing, but I just want to be certain.
TIH00001625	Good luck, and thank you.
TIH00001626	Why should I help the Fiends? It seems counter-intuitive.
TIH00001627	That's been the gut reaction of a lot of people, including some of the Followers. However, when you stop to think about it, this makes sense.
TIH00001628	Let me put all my cards on the table - I used to be a Fiend. I got caught up in it at a young age, and it almost killed me.
TIH00001629	When the Followers found me, I was beaten, broken, and strung-out. They pulled me from the brink, got me on track. Then they gave me an education.
TIH00001630	I won't make excuses for the Fiends' actions, but they're still human - most of them. The majority are just in it for drugs and the camaraderie.
TIH00001631	I believe we can save most of them with treatment. For every Fiend we rehabilitate, we save countless bystanders who would've been victims.
TIH00001632	The Fiends are a disease. The only treatment is lead.
TIH00001633	That's...  I thought you were different, but you're just another dumb drifter. New Vegas is better off without cunts like you.
TIH00001634	Why do you want my help?
TIH00001635	We saw how you handled the Syndicate. That's no everyday occurence. A lot of people are better off because of what you did.
TIH00001636	You've got guts... and money. We need both to get this thing off the ground.
TIH00001637	I'm not going to help you. End of story.
TIH00001638	You don't get it, do you? We could've helped these people, healed them. All you know how to do is hurt them. Fuck you.
TIH00001639	aaInheritancePost07CadyIntro01
TIH00001640	I hope the rats weren't too much for you.
TIH00001641	Probably not much different than taking down the Syndicate, though.
TIH00001642	Who are you?
TIH00001643	Name's Cady. I'm with the Rangers, on my first tour here in Vegas. Hell of a place, I must admit.
TIH00001644	Out of my way, shitkicker.
TIH00001645	Slow down, rat king. I've got some business with you.
TIH00001646	Slow down, rat queen. I've got some business with you.
TIH00001647	What do you want?
TIH00001648	My job here is simple. Kill as many Fiends as possible, through any means necessary. It's a special assignment, given to me after my work up north.
TIH00001649	See, I got a reputation for hunting and killing raiders through unconventional methods. Some are hung up on shooting them, but dead is dead.
TIH00001650	Take the 80's, for example. Bunch of bloody heathens, spread all over. I took down one of their camps by poisoning their water supply.
TIH00001651	That brings me to our business. I see that you're helping the Followers set this clinic up. That's good, real good. Westside could use it.
TIH00001652	As for the Fiends, I have other plans. I've got a pal over in OSI who can hook me up with some "altered" Fixer and Jet. The kind used in rehab.
TIH00001653	I want to make sure this clinic uses my supplier, and that a doctor of our choosing is put in charge. Then we'll give the Fiends their medicine.
TIH00001654	<Remain Silent>
TIH00001655	What about Grant? He wants to run the clinic.
TIH00001656	Grant? That hippie thinks he can magically cure the Fiends and rescue Westside with peace and love. Bleeding heart dumbass.
TIH00001657	What he doesn't understand is that Westside won't forgive or forget, and most of those Fiends can't be saved, no matter what you do.
TIH00001658	They're a bunch of rabid puppies, drooling and biting, foaming out of their asses. The only cure is to stomp their little puppy skulls.
TIH00001659	If it means taking out Fiends, you can count me in.
TIH00001660	Good. Just keep on going with Grant's plan, getting this place set up. Once the clinic is open, look me up at McCarran. We'll go from there.
TIH00001661	I'm not interested in your plan.
TIH00001662	Alright, just sleep on it. You think long and hard about what those Fiends have done to people around here, then give me answer.
TIH00001663	Once the clinic is open and you come back to your senses, look me up at McCarran. We'll go from there.
TIH00001664	This plan seems to run counter to the principles of the NCR, not to mention the Followers.
TIH00001665	What? As opposed to let them run amuck? Fiends murder, rape, and rampage all over, and you want to talk about principles?
TIH00001666	If any of those pacifist douchebags in the Followers feel so strongly about saving the Fiends, let them take a mission trip to Vault 3.
TIH00001667	No, they're nice and cozy in their little fort, curing the clap and handing out suppositories.
TIH00001668	What do I get for going along with your plan?
TIH00001669	Well, besides the appreciation of the New California Republic...
TIH00001670	I believe some payment would be in order, and maybe even an item or two you can't get anywhere else, courtesy of the Rangers.
TIH00001671	Is there any reason you're so cynical? It seems like the clinic would save a few Fiends.
TIH00001672	A few? Maybe. But what happens for these few afterwards? Are they welcomed back into society with open arms?
TIH00001673	What do you think will happen when some shopkeeper in Westside sees the asshole who robbed him last year? Or notices his wife's killer? Shit.
TIH00001674	Imagine taking the average Fiend... clean him up and throw him in society. He'd be a walking clusterfuck. You just can't change human nature.
TIH00001675	I'll think about it.
TIH00001676	Ok. All I ask is that you keep this to yourself, but continue with Grant's plan for the time being, if only for appearances.
TIH00001677	Once the clinic is open, look me up at McCarran if you change your mind. We'll go from there.
TIH00001678	The building had a rat problem, but I took care of it.
TIH00001679	Rats? Those filthy creatures trigger my gag reflex for some reason. Thanks for purging them.
TIH00001680	But with that building secured, we can get to the real issue: funding. Specifically, 5,000 caps to get this off the ground. Are you still with me?
TIH00001681	You're doing a wonderful thing for the Followers, for this community. I'll begin the preparations immediately.
TIH00001682	In the meantime, you should round up our first set of patients. I know of a Fiend hideout south of Westside, where a group is holed up.
TIH00001683	Check them out, and see if you can convince them to submit to treatment. Oh, and try to avoid killing them, alright?
TIH00001684	Here are the caps to fund the clinic. <Pay 5,000 caps>
TIH00001685	That's perfectly understandable. Just speak with me when you get the cash together, and we'll go from there.
TIH00001686	I don't have 5,000 caps with me.
TIH00001687	aaInheritancePost07GrantDontHaveCaps
TIH00001688	I ran into a guy named Cady. He wants to use the clinic as a means to poison the Fiends.
TIH00001689	Cady? That butcher is here? Jesus, I heard about what he did up north, killing groups of the 80's, even women and children. He's a monster.
TIH00001690	I knew the NCR wouldn't leave us alone. Damn them to hell for this. We'll have to find some way to deal with him. I need to think on this.
TIH00001691	In the meantime, we'll continue as planned. Do you have the caps together?
TIH00001692	aaInheritancePost07BuckyIntro01
TIH00001693	Al, you better have some Jet for us...
TIH00001694	Where's Al? Who the fuck are you?
TIH00001695	Rehab? You mean like quitting drugs?
TIH00001696	That... that's a good one. Are you fucking high? You walk into a Fiend den and tell them to get clean? Sure, right after we get back from church.
TIH00001697	Now get the fuck out of here before the joke gets old. Fucking nutjob.
TIH00001698	The Followers are opening a rehab clinic for Fiends. I want all of you to check yourselves in.
TIH00001699	Oh, you're... special. I think you're in the wrong place. Can you even understand me?
TIH00001700	Gaunt say you Friends. Want you to kick add dicks son.
TIH00001701	I'm here to cure your addiction. You're taking twelve steps straight to hell! <Attack>
TIH00001702	Fuck you, psycho!
TIH00001703	aaInheritancePost07BuckyMedicine
TIH00001704	Are you fucking with me, doc?
TIH00001705	I just wanted to get high, you know? I didn't think about it. None of us did. I'll get checked out, alright?
TIH00001706	Rotting teeth, boils, paranoia... the Jet is showing. Keep it up and you'll be dead within the year.
TIH00001707	Save your bullshit for someone who cares, fucko.
TIH00001708	You seem to be suffering from Captain Trips. Using Jet will exacerbate your condition.
TIH00001709	You clearly aren't ready for treatment. I'll be on my way.
TIH00001710	No, I think you've got some caps in those pockets, not to mention all the other goodies you're lugging around.
TIH00001711	I think we'll just off you and take the goods.
TIH00001712	aaInheritancePost07BuckySpeech
TIH00001713	No shit, huh?
TIH00001714	Back when I joined this crew, it was a blast. Getting high all day, watching Cook-Cook roast NCR troops. Now we're barely surviving.
TIH00001715	Alright, me and my crew will check this place out. I ain't making any promises, though.
TIH00001716	It's only a matter of time before you overdose or the NCR puts you down. Get clean or die.
TIH00001717	My first step will be putting my boot up your ass if you don't get out of here.
TIH00001718	The first step is acknowledging you have a problem.
TIH00001719	I'll give you five hundred caps now, and five hundred caps after the treatment. <Pay 500 caps>
TIH00001720	Done. Just don't go expecting any miracles. Vegas might change, but the Fiends never do.
TIH00001721	Here, this will get you by until you get treated. <Give three vials of Jet>
TIH00001722	Oh, you are fucking lifesaver!
TIH00001723	I'm gonna push off, then we'll check out that clinic. You got my word.
TIH00001724	aaInheritancePost07BuckyIntelligence
TIH00001725	Where do you learn this stuff? That's disgusting.
TIH00001726	Alright, I'll check this place out, but I'll make no promises.
TIH00001727	Do you know what Jet is made from? Brahmin dung. You are addicted to cowshit.
TIH00001728	Fuck, if this is what happens to me, I need to get clean.
TIH00001729	Add dicks son to Jeff is bad! Fallows of pox-lips give rehash bill, tits shun.
TIH00001730	aaInheritancePost07GrantFiendsFate
TIH00001731	I knew that some of them would be willing to get treatment. Even then, I know it can be tense negotiating with Fiends for... anything.
TIH00001732	With your funding, we were able to get the building cleared out, and the clinic should be open shortly.
TIH00001733	I'm heading there now. Please stop by when you get a chance, and we can see if there's any work left for you. Thank you.
TIH00001734	I convinced some of the Fiends to enter rehab.
TIH00001735	That's not what I wanted. They may be addicts, but they shouldn't be gunned down like dumb animals.
TIH00001736	Regardless, we were here to get the building cleared out, and the clinic should be open shortly.
TIH00001737	I'm heading there now. Please stop by when you get a chance, and we can see if there's any work left for you. Thank you.
TIH00001738	The meeting with the Fiends went bad - I was forced to kill them out of self-defence.
TIH00001739	Do you need any more help with the new clinic?
TIH00001740	It's come to my attention that the NCR wants to supplant our staff and change the purpose of this clinic. Their scheme is... disturbing.
TIH00001741	The man behind it all is a Ranger named Cady. He's the NCR go-to guy for purging raiders and tribals who don't bend to the Republic's demands.
TIH00001742	He's here to exterminate the Fiends, and from what I hear he plans on using our clinic to disperse hot doses of Fixer and Jet.
TIH00001743	What the Followers need... what I need... is for this Ranger to go away. I believe you have a way with people... you can make him understand.
TIH00001744	Do you need any more help with the new clinic?
TIH00001745	No, with Cady out of the way, I think the NCR will leave us be. Thanks for everything, Courier.
TIH00001746	It should go without saying that if you need supplies, medical treatment, anything... you're always welcome here. Good luck to you.
TIH00001747	Yeah, I've been thinking about Cady, the ranger you mentioned. We can't ignore him any more. Word has gotten around about his scheme.
TIH00001748	What the Followers need... what I need... is for this Ranger to go away. I believe you have a way with people... you can make him understand.
TIH00001749	Wait, are you asking me to kill Cady?
TIH00001750	I'm asking you to do whatever it takes to make him back off. If he goes ahead with this plan, it could kill hundreds, many of them innocent.
TIH00001751	Fine, I'll make sure Cady is out of the picture.
TIH00001752	Reason with the man if you can. If he won't listen... God help him. It's the life of one Ranger weighed against... hundreds. Do what you must.
TIH00001753	I don't like where this is headed. I only signed up to help the clinic, not to do your dirty work.
TIH00001754	I don't like it, but this is the only way to be sure... it's the best option for the people of Westside.
TIH00001755	Look, I understand if you have your doubts, but the Followers need you on this one. Do it, and I'll be in your debt. Just think about it.
TIH00001756	aaInheritancePost07CadyOPENPlan
TIH00001757	Of course. I've already got my man and the loaded drugs all lined up, all that needs to happen is for Grant and his crew to skedaddle.
TIH00001758	It's not unusual for the Followers and the NCR to butt heads, but you need to tread lightly. Don't get bloody on this. Just scare him off.
TIH00001759	With that said, if you have exhausted every option and he still won't leave, then do what you have to, but be discreet. Now get it done.
TIH00001760	The clinic is open. I've decided to go ahead with your plan.
TIH00001761	The Followers know about your plan. You need to leave town, right now.
TIH00001762	Gonna save the poor, innocent Fiends and make peace with Westside, all at the same time?
TIH00001763	It's bullshit, kid. You might weaken the Fiends, but you won't stop them. Someone worse might even take their place.
TIH00001764	The solution is to destroy them, make an example for all to see. Maybe in that sense I admire old Caesar. He doesn't take half-measures.
TIH00001765	You're leaving right now - in a pine box. <Attack>
TIH00001766	...
TIH00001767	I need to get going.
TIH00001768	...
TIH00001769	aaInheritancePost07CadyLeaveSpeech
TIH00001770	Maybe, but it's damn near guaranteed to work. But... I know what you're saying.
TIH00001771	Most people are dumber than a Brahmin. Unless you decapitate one hundred Fiends in front of them, people will refuse to believe we did it.
TIH00001772	Besides, the brass seems committed to using bounty hunters. I thinks it's all a con, turning in nappy fingers for cash and calling it a victory.
TIH00001773	The Fiends are like one of those... snake things... with the head that grows back. Only way to stop it is to burn that fucker whole.
TIH00001774	Mark my words, Courier: you keep cutting off heads, and eventually some big, bad motherfucker will grow back and eat your ass whole.
TIH00001775	In the meantime, I'll go back to hunting 80's up north. Nobody every complained about that. Take care of yourself.
TIH00001776	With your plan the NCR won't be credited for killing the Fiends. People will attribute it to drugs.
TIH00001777	Bounty hunters? Useless as tits on a gecko. I wipe my ass with those stupid fucking posters, spread all over creation by some retard.
TIH00001778	Don't you think the Fiends should be left to bounty hunters?
TIH00001779	Would 10,000 caps convince you to leave? <Pay 10,000 caps>
TIH00001780	Ten thousand?
TIH00001781	If you want to fund my retirement, so be it. The Followers can keep the Fiends. Nice doing business with you, Courier.
TIH00001782	aaInheritancePost07CadyLeaveRep
TIH00001783	Ok, hero. But when this goes sour, the brass will hear about it. Hippies and Fiends... you can keep them.
TIH00001784	[NCR Rep] You're hurting our standing in the Mojave. Go back to California, now.
TIH00001785	INCOMPLETE
TIH00001786	aaInheritancePost07CadyLeaveIntimidate
TIH00001787	Fuck, I'm going to California!
TIH00001788	There's a bounty on your head: a billion unmarked traveler's checks. RUN!
TIH00001789	aaInheritancePost07CadyLeaveAttackCool
TIH00001790	This is as good a day to die as any, youngster.
TIH00001791	I didn't want to do it this way, but you've left me no choice. <Attack>
TIH00001792	aaInheritancePost07CadyTURNIN
TIH00001793	Excellent. I'll send word to my man that he can get moved in. You've done the NCR a service, and we won't soon forget it.
TIH00001794	As promised, here's your due, along with an extra "something". As for me, I'm off to California. Take care of yourself.
TIH00001795	I convinced Grant to hand the clinic over to the NCR.
TIH00001796	Shit fire, we don't need that kind of PR. Fucking maniac...
TIH00001797	Regardless, it got the job done. Here's the payment we agreed upon. I'll see you around, Courier.
TIH00001798	I was forced to kill Grant. The clinic is yours now.
TIH00001799	aaInheritancePost07GrantTURNIN
TIH00001800	Good, I know it wouldn't have been easy getting through to a stubborn hick like Cady. With him out of the picture, we can focus on the clinic.
TIH00001801	Don't hesitate to come back if you need anything. We couldn't have done this without you, Courier.
TIH00001802	I convinced Cady to leave the Mojave.
TIH00001803	God, I just hope this doesn't come back on us. The Followers are under enough pressure from the NCR.
TIH00001804	The important thing is that this clinic stays open, for the greater benefit of Westside and New Vegas. You did a good thing, Courier.
TIH00001805	If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. You're always welcome here.
TIH00001806	I was forced to kill Cady. He's out of the picture.
TIH00001807	aaInheritancePost07GrantLeaveIntro
TIH00001808	What? You mean you're actually siding with Cady? The man is a thug... a fascist!
TIH00001809	Look at what we've built here! Why in the hell would I leave it now?
TIH00001810	I'm going to enact Cady's plan for the Clinic. You and the Followers need to leave, now.
TIH00001811	aaInheritancePost07GrantLEAVESpeech
TIH00001812	We really are swimming against the current here, aren't we? Maybe it was just a dumb dream, but it was real for a little while.
TIH00001813	That seems to be our destiny... getting in position to help people, only to get steamrolled by the NCR. Maybe next time, Courier.
TIH00001814	The NCR wants this clinic. It's only a matter of time before they push the Followers out.
TIH00001815	You're reaching, Courier. We've invested too many resources, too much manpower to simply leave it behind. So... fuck no.
TIH00001816	NCR, fuck yeah! Unlawful seizure, fuck yeah! Get out, fuck yeah!
TIH00001817	aaInheritancePost07GrantLEAVEIntimidate
TIH00001818	You're an animal, just like Cady. We'll leave... but you'll have to live with this. Everything comes back to you in the end, Courier. Remember that.
TIH00001819	Get out or the Followers will be treating you for a case of curb-stomp.
TIH00001820	You think you can intimidate me? Have you forgotten where I came from? Fuck you.
TIH00001821	Get out or your buddies will be patching you up for... ass-kicked... itus.
TIH00001822	<Pay Caps>
TIH00001823	I can't... I, I...
TIH00001824	This stays between us. Maybe I can help some people with it, even if I've failed here. Goodbye.
TIH00001825	10,000 caps would do a lot of good in Freeside. You sure you don't want to leave? <Pay 10,000 caps>

TIH00001828	I need to get going.
TIH00001829	...
TIH00001830	I'm here about the letter.
TIH00001831	Outstanding! I was having trouble recruiting mercs for this. Nobody wants to come near this place, like it's cursed or something.
TIH00001832	I ain't gonna lie - what the Legion did that day hurt the Rangers... hurt the entire NCR. I intend to turn the tables on those fuckers.
TIH00001833	If you agree to take part in this operation, you'll get a signing bonus of 1,000 caps, followed by 4,000 when we're finished. Are you good to go?
TIH00001834	Ok, are you with us?
TIH00001835	I'd like to discuss the contract.
TIH00001836	Thank you.

TIH00001845	<The courier begin gesticulating wildly, initiating an unholy ceremony...>
TIH00001846	<Wink at the courier>
TIH00001847	You and the NCR can wipe my ass with this letter. The Mojave is better off without you.
TIH00001848	Another Ranger told me it would be a mistake to count on some cheesedick civilian for this gig. Guess I should have listened to him.
TIH00001849	So you're the guy in charge, right?
TIH00001850	Ranger Beaumont, commander of this little post. I was... out on patrol when the station was hit, and it's my responsibility to make it right.
TIH00001851	Why is the NCR trying to keep Ranger Station Charlie?
TIH00001852	Charlie is all that stands between most of the raiding parties and Novac, and it guards an important trade route.
TIH00001853	More importantly, the Rangers have to hold this spot after what happened. Legion gave us a black eye, so we got to show them we're still strong.
TIH00001854	What would we be up against?
TIH00001855	Some of that's classified, and I can only divulge the details when you've signed on. Suffice it to say it would be a sizeable Legion detachment.
TIH00001856	Alright, I'll take the contract.
TIH00001857	Good, here's your signing bonus.
TIH00001858	This is the situation: we believe the attack on Charlie was engineered by a pair of centurions known as the "Gemini" or "Twins".
TIH00001859	They're known as Castor and Pollux, titles granted by Caesar himself for their ferocity and cunning. We don't know much else about them.
TIH00001860	Not long after the attack on Charlie, one of our rangers tracked a raiding party to Sharp's Cavern, which we believe is host to the twins.
TIH00001861	Your mission is to reconnoiter the cave, terminate any Legion personnel present, and kill the twins.
TIH00001862	One more thing, though. You might have surmised that this is rather... personal... for the Rangers. We want the Legion to know who was responsible.
TIH00001863	Take this note, and pin it on a prominent place after you've killed the garrison. It's got a saying in Latin which should aggravate the Legion.
TIH00001864	That's it. Do you have any questions before setting off?
TIH00001865	I need more time to think about this.
TIH00001866	Fine, just don't take too long, or we'll be forced to go with a different contractor.
TIH00001867	Thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested.
TIH00001868	I suppose I misjudged you. I guess we'll have to find someone else. Thanks for meeting with me, regardless.
TIH00001869	Why do you want me to mutilate their corpses? Wouldn't that make us just as barbaric as the Legion?
TIH00001870	What, you're some kind of philosopher now?
TIH00001871	You haven't seen real barbarism. I've run LRP's into Arizona, seen shit that would make your delicate little eyes bleed out.
TIH00001872	What they do to women and their slaves, especially in the mines... I wish I could forget it. Butchering those twin freaks is a small dose of justice.
TIH00001873	I don't have any more questions.
TIH00001874	Good luck, Courier. Make 'em hurt... make 'em bleed.
TIH00001875	What's the enemy's strength?
TIH00001876	I'm not entirely sure. It's almost certainly one of their underground complexes, probably booby-trapped to hell, so watch your step.
TIH00001877	The good news is that it's likely a stopover for lightly-armored, fast-moving raiding parties. You shouldn't encounter heavy infantry or veterans.
TIH00001878	Why am I going in alone? Why not take a platoon of Rangers and track them down?
TIH00001879	You ever tracked a Legion party in the desert? With their conditioning, discipline, and land navigation, it's damn difficult, even for Rangers.
TIH00001880	The Legion excels at running, hiding, waiting for a mismatch. Then they strike fast and disappear. Did at Nelson. Did it here.
TIH00001881	The surest way to beat them is to pin them down in an open battle where our firepower and tactical flexibility can fuck them up. Like at the Dam.
TIH00001882	I could call in a company of infantry, but they'd sniff them out a mile away, would be out of there in minutes. One skilled operator is perfect.
TIH00001883	If you pull this off right, it should draw them into attacking Charlie... except this time we'll be waiting for them.
TIH00001884	Should an opportunity arise, do you want me to take prisoners?
TIH00001885	We ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; we in the killing Legion business.
TIH00001886	aaInheritancePost09KoestlerIntro01
TIH00001887	Beg your pardon, Courier. I'd like a minute of your time.
TIH00001888	What do you want?
TIH00001889	I'll be brief. I work for an unnamed agency within the NCR, and I'm conducting an investigation into Ranger's Beaumont.
TIH00001890	There are a lot of questions surrounding the Legion attack here, and my superiors are concerned about Beaumont's ability to command.
TIH00001891	Some members of the brass want to scapegoat Beaumont for what happened, while others want to take a hard look at him first, see if it's justified.
TIH00001892	As an outsider, you're a bit more objective than the Rangers or other troops. I'd like for you to check in with me after the mission is finished.
TIH00001893	I want the facts as well as your own evaluation. Is he a capable leader? Does he seem mentally stable? Is he following command's instructions?
TIH00001894	Just talk to me when the dust settles, let me know how he held up. If you can do that, there's a bonus waiting for you.
TIH00001895	All I need is information, and you get paid. It's as simple as that. Can I count on you?
TIH00001896	Can it, shitbird. There's Legionaries that need killing.
TIH00001897	I'll be brief. I work for an unnamed agency within the NCR, and I'm conducting an investigation into Ranger's Beaumont.
TIH00001898	There are a lot of questions surrounding the Legion attack here, and my superiors are concerned about Beaumont's ability to command.
TIH00001899	Some members of the brass want to scapegoat Beaumont for what happened, while others want to take a hard look at him first, see if it's justified.
TIH00001900	As an outsider, you're a bit more objective than the Rangers or other troops. I'd like for you to check in with me after the mission is finished.
TIH00001901	I want the facts as well as your own evaluation. Is he a capable leader? Does he seem mentally stable? Is he following protocol?
TIH00001902	Just talk to me when the dust settles, let me know how he held up. If you can do that, there's a bonus waiting for you.
TIH00001903	All I need is information, and you get paid. It's as simple as that. Can I count on you?
TIH00001904	aaInheritancePost09KoestlerInvestigate01
TIH00001905	I'll do it.
TIH00001906	Excellent. I'll be waiting up in Novac. Speak with me after the operation.
TIH00001907	I'll think about it.
TIH00001908	That's fine. Just see me up in Novac after the operation. Good luck out there.
TIH00001909	Forget about it. I'm not a rat.
TIH00001910	You grunts and mercs are all the same. If you change your mind, and you actually want to get paid, just see me up in Novac after all this.
TIH00001911	I managed to kill one of the twins, but the other is still at large.
TIH00001912	We already got word. Zombies at Echo seen Castor and, here's the good part... a company-sized force heading our way!
TIH00001913	You stirred em up good, Mailman. We're gonna get some payback.
TIH00001914	What are you doing out here?
TIH00001915	Paying my respects, Courier. Some good men and women died here. Ran lots of ops with Stepinac, the big-nosed bastard.
TIH00001916	But they're dead and gone, ain't no use dwelling on it.
TIH00001917	aaInheritancePost09BeaumontYouDrunk
TIH00001918	What are we going to do next?
TIH00001919	Stand our ground, just like true Rangers. We'll make that old bitch Tandi proud!
TIH00001920	Well, there is a platoon of regulars on patrol to the south. I reckon they could help. But I don't want no grunts taking the glory from Rangers.
TIH00001921	Listen, you drunk bastard, not all of us have a deathwish. You better have some kind of plan.
TIH00001922	Well, there is a platoon of regulars on patrol to the south. I reckon they could help. But I don't want no grunts taking the glory from Rangers.
TIH00001923	I agree. We don't need any help.
TIH00001924	Damn right. We're going to butcher those plumed assholes by the bushel. However, we've got a little time until they show up.
TIH00001925	If you want to set mines or call in any buddies, this is the time to do it. Make it quick, and then check in with me when you're ready.
TIH00001926	aaInheritancePost09BeaumontHelpSpeech
TIH00001927	Fuck, you're probably right. I let my ego get in the way of good sense sometimes. It comes with the territory.
TIH00001928	Fine, I'll call em up on the radio, see if they can't send us a squad or two.
TIH00001929	If you want to set mines or call in any buddies, this is the time to do it. Make it quick, and then check in with me when you're ready.
TIH00001930	Nobody will question the actions of the Rangers, even if a handful of grunts are around.
TIH00001931	What good would a bunch of half-retarded conscripts do? Most of those assholes can't even march in a straight line. No way.
TIH00001932	More defenders make more sense, right? You shouldn't underestimate NCR Troopers.
TIH00001933	I disagree with the plan, but it's your call.
TIH00001934	Damn right it is. We're going to butcher those plumed assholes by the bushel. However, we've got a little time until they show up.
TIH00001935	If you want to set mines or call in any buddies, this is the time to do it. Make it quick, and then check in with me when you're ready.
TIH00001936	aaInheritancePost09BeaumontHelpIntelligence
TIH00001937	Shit, that smarts. Ok, I'll call them up, see if they'll send us a squad or two. We better batten down the fucking hatches.
TIH00001938	If you want to set mines or call in any buddies, this is the time to do it. Make it quick, and then check in with me when you're ready.
TIH00001939	With only the Rangers, this is a ten-to-one fight. That's not courage, it's suicide.
TIH00001940	I've made all my preparations for the battle.
TIH00001941	Good timing. Scouts radioed in, said they're about to be right on top of us. Get ready.
TIH00001942	I should get going.
TIH00001943	...
TIH00001944	It looks like we won.
TIH00001945	Yeah, we did, though I'll be damned if they didn't throw everything at us. Did you see Castor charging in with that fist thing? Idiot.
TIH00001946	Here's the payment I promised. I doubt we could've pulled this off without you, Courier.
TIH00001947	I didn't do too much. The Rangers made the real sacrifice here.
TIH00001948	No doubt, but you bled here with us. We won't soon forget it. You're a good sort - don't let the Wasteland change you, kid.
TIH00001949	It's just part of the job.
TIH00001950	Job or not, you were a lifesaver. The Rangers won't forget a good turn like this. You take care of yourself.
TIH00001951	Let's face it - you all would be dead if I hadn't been here.
TIH00001952	Heh, maybe. You keep your confidence up and your head down, kid. We won't forget what you did for us. Take care.
TIH00001953	Ranger Beaumont was a model leader. There isn't a thing he could've done better.
TIH00001954	Really? Alright, I'll put it in my report. As for you, here's the bonus we discussed. Thanks for your help.
TIH00001955	I'll include your statement in my report. We'll make sure he and the other defenders are posthumously decorated for their actions. Thank you.
TIH00001956	Ranger Beaumont was a model leader, and he died a hero. There isn't a thing he could've done better.
TIH00001957	Beaumont wasn't perfect, but he was a solid commander.
TIH00001958	Really? Alright, I'll put it in my report. As for you, here's the bonus we discussed. Thanks for your help.
TIH00001959	I'll include your statement in my report. We'll make sure he and the other defenders are posthumously decorated for their actions. Thank you.
TIH00001960	Beaumont wasn't perfect, but he led from the front and went down fighting.
TIH00001961	aaInheritancePost09KoestlerENDProblems
TIH00001962	Beaumont's arrogance is only exceeded by his stupidity. He is a danger to everyone in his command.
TIH00001963	So be it. I'll include your candid assessment in my report. Here's the bonus we discussed. Thanks for your help.
TIH00001964	So be it. I'll include your candid assessment in my report. Here's the bonus we discussed. Thanks for your help.
TIH00001965	The NCR lucked out when Beaumont was killed. He was a drunken fool who endangered his troops.
TIH00001966	I've got nothing to say to you. We are finished.
TIH00001967	Fine, have it your way. I'll just have to fill in the blanks on the report myself.
TIH00001968	Fine, have it your way. I'll just have to fill in the blanks on the report myself.
TIH00001969	If we're really going up against a company of Legionaries, we'll need more reinforcements.
TIH00001970	That's... no, no way. I'm a Ranger, damn it. We can hold this post. We will hold this post. Besides, nobody would get here in time.
TIH00001971	Reinforcements could be a trump card. Winners play smart, not crazy. Radio them in.
TIH00001972	Well, Legion might drop a full house of fuck on us. You're right. I'll call in the backup. Let's just hope they get here in time.
TIH00001973	aaInheritancePost09BeaumontBACKUPIntelligence
TIH00001974	That might work, but I don't know if they'd get here in time. I'll call up command and see what they can send our way. Don't hold your breath.
TIH00001975	You would surprise the attackers with a flanking attack. They would be routed, and you'd be a hero.
TIH00001976	No, this is our fight. I won't go crying up the chain like those pussy-ass regulars at Forlorn Hope.
TIH00001977	The NCR has manpower to spare. Stop being a stubborn ass and radio for help.
TIH00001978	Fine. This is as good a day to die as any.
TIH00001979	Maybe. That ain't for us to decide. In the meantime, we stand tall.
TIH00001980	So I'm going to get killed defending this shithole just so you can get a posthumous medal? Great.
TIH00001981	This is my shithole, and nobody put a gun to your head when you signed the contract. Like they say, don't ask reasons, just die. Something like that.
TIH00001982	aaInheritancePost09BeaumontBACKUPQuit
TIH00001983	Who are you?
TIH00001984	Rubin's the name. I'm Beaumont's replacement. This is my first assignment as a station commander.
TIH00001985	Where's Beaumont?
TIH00001986	The brass was impressed with his leadership during the attack on Charlie, so they promoted him to Captain, put him in charge of training Rangers.
TIH00001987	Rumor has it that he's now on the short list of potential successors to Hanlon, as Scull and some of the other old dogs ran afoul of the bosses.
TIH00001988	He had just put in his twenty, and after the bloodbath here at Charlie, the brass asked him to retire. Kept his rank and pension, but still...
TIH00001989	Fucking brass... they gave him an admin discharge, stripped him of rank and benefits. Poor bastard got in his dress uniform and blew his brains out.
TIH00001990	He was posthumously decorated. I even heard a senator showed up at his funeral. Rumor has it they're gonna name a school after him.
TIH00001991	Did the brass say anything about Beaumont after his death?
TIH00001992	Not much. He got a military funeral, and his widow got the flag and the death benefits. They're going to be burying more of us soon, I'm afraid.
TIH00001993	Did the brass say anything about Beaumont after his death?
TIH00001994	Not much. He got a military funeral, and his widow got the flag and the death benefits. They're going to be burying more of us soon, I'm afraid.
TIH00001995	Did the brass say anything about Beaumont after his death?
TIH00001996	Yeah, they stripped him of all his rank and honors, then shit on his record. His poor widow didn't even get the death benefits.
TIH00001997	Fucking candy-ass brass sits in Shady Sands, counting beans and judging us... most of those fucks never been near combat. Cocksuckers.
TIH00001998	Did the brass say anything about Beaumont after his death?
TIH00001999	What's your background?
TIH00002000	Came up out of Junktown. Came from a long line of merchants and traders. My dad had a path laid out for me, gonna have me take over the business.
TIH00002001	But an honest day's wages never interested me. Drove dad crazy, didn't really have my head in the business.
TIH00002002	One day on a caravan I saw a troop of Rangers ambush some slavers from a distance. I had never seen anything like it. After that my mind was made up.
TIH00002003	I joined when I turned seventeen, did a tour in the infantry, then passed the Ranger screening when I was twenty. It's been a hell of a ride since.
TIH00002004	Do you need any help?
TIH00002005	I'm afraid not. Funds for contractors have dried up, and the Legion has backed off after that last dustup.
TIH00002006	aaInheritancePost09RubinGOODBYE
TIH00002007	What's your background?
TIH00002008	Grew up on a farm near Dayglow, joined up in '59. Spent some time with the grunts before I made Ranger. Then I hunted raiders for a spell.
TIH00002009	I marched into Bullhead with Kimball back in '70, and did my last tour picking up the pieces at Zulu. Got here a few months back.
TIH00002010	You seem to have a lot of hatred for the Legion. Don't you worry about it affecting your decisions?
TIH00002011	No. I'll tell you what it does. It gives me reason to wake up in the morning when I'm out here, hundreds of miles away from my wife and kids.
TIH00002012	I hear assholes saying hate is always a bad thing. You almost have to hate to kill a man, at least the first time. To win wars, you have to kill.
TIH00002013	Believe me, my mind is sharp and my judgment is sound. But when I put a .44 round through some Centurion's dome, I'm smiling. Hate makes you strong.
TIH00002014	How did the Legion manage to pull off the raid here?
TIH00002015	What, you aren't going to blame me right off the bat? I'm so used to the brass crawling up my ass about it, it's made me cagey about the affair.
TIH00002016	The Legion thrives on speed and surprise. It's a necessity, since they wear ancient jock straps as armor and fight with sharp sticks.
TIH00002017	The Brass mandates dumbass search and destroy missions in the bush, so I was out on patrol. Charlie was at half-strength when the Legion hit it.
TIH00002018	Sometimes the patrols are successful, particularly if we catch the Legion in a night ambush. Dumbasses don't use night vision, ya know?
TIH00002019	But generally the Legion out-maneuvers us in the field. Their raiding parties are hard to track, much less catch. Command didn't give a shit.
TIH00002020	I told them we were undermanned, but they just sit back in their comfortable chairs, in their air-conditioned offices, and yell, "Drive on!"
TIH00002021	Generals want the kills to pad their stats. Body counts make for nice headlines and help you get promoted. Gotta climb that ladder!
TIH00002022	But something I learned long ago... is that a commander's first responsibility is take care of his troops. That was my charge, and I failed.
TIH00002023	I can't bring them back, but I guaran-damn-tee you I'm going to send some Legionaries straight to hell before I hang it up.
TIH00002024	Aren't you worried at least a little bit that this plan might backfire?
TIH00002025	Backfire? As in the Legion sends more than a raiding party? It's doubtful, but if they do, we'll be ready.
TIH00002026	Zulu? What happened there?
TIH00002027	Not much until my tour was winding down. I missed the big rodeo back in '79, when the Legion made real try for it.
TIH00002028	It's a sliver of rock overlooking a pass south of Bullhead. Politicians want the base because it protects the silver mines.
TIH00002029	Problem is they underestimated how bad the Legion would want it. Caesar's southern commander, Marcellus, just about wiped Zulu off the map.
TIH00002030	Wasn't much left when I got there. We had to rebuild the defenses, replenish the garrison, and even now... I don't know if it's secure.
TIH00002031	Before I left, Legion scouts started showing up, sniping our troops. Rumor has it that Marcellus is gonna attack Zulu again.
TIH00002032	If that's true, I'm sorry for the poor bastards who are going to be there. Marcellus is just... dangerous. God help them.
TIH00002033	What makes Marcellus so dangerous?
TIH00002034	He's unpredictable, which separates him from most of Caesar's boys. A lot of them are just thugs who got rank by stomping half-assed tribals.
TIH00002035	Marcellus, though... he doesn't follow a lot of the same rules as other commanders... he only cares about winning.
TIH00002036	Fuckwit Lanius might be a giant mongoloid badass, but his tactical approach is the same as the others. Fodder, primes, veterans. Rinse, repeat.
TIH00002037	Marcellus doesn't do that shit. He actually tries to keep his men alive, and grants them some flexibility. They operate in heavily-armed squads.
TIH00002038	He'll feign attacks, retreat, then hit you in flanks. I seen it happen to a patrol. No survivors. On top of that, he does things that just... well...
TIH00002039	I've seen some awful shit that will haunt my dreams, but the worst might have been at Zulu, when a group of escaped slaves approached the camp.
TIH00002040	Men ran down to help them, even as I told them to back off. It was a bunch of kids. Just as they had crowded around them, there was an explosion.
TIH00002041	It wasn't just a mess. It was sulphur, crying, body parts, and smoke, right outside the base. We picked up the pieces of six kids and eight troopers.
TIH00002042	That was before his scouts even showed up. It was his way of letting us know that he still had his sights on Zulu. He won't stop until he gets it.
TIH00002043	So what's your story?
TIH00002044	I'm an employee of the NCR. That's all you need to know.
TIH00002045	I think I might be addicted to something.
TIH00002046	It happens to the best of us. Let me have a look.
TIH00002047	I think I'll tough it out.
TIH00002048	Gonna try the "Pain don't hurt" routine? It doesn't work with an addiction. But I'm just a doctor, right? What the fuck would I know?
TIH00002049	Yes, cure me.
TIH00002050	Your faith... in medicine... has healed you. Go in peace.
TIH00002051	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
TIH00002052	Sorry, I don't treat Hypochondriasis. You're perfectly fine.
TIH00002053	This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you patched up in no time.
TIH00002054	Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
TIH00002055	I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
TIH00002056	All right, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
TIH00002057	Stay as still as possible. This may cause some... discomfort.
TIH00002058	I give free treatment to the indigent and needy. You aren't one of them.
TIH00002059	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
TIH00002060	All right, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
TIH00002061	Stay as still as possible. This may cause some... discomfort.
TIH00002062	I give free treatment to the indigent and needy. You aren't one of them.

TIH00002064	All right, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
TIH00002065	Stay as still as possible. This may cause some... discomfort.
TIH00002066	I give free treatment to the indigent and needy. You aren't one of them.
TIH00002067	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
TIH00002068	That's all I need.
TIH00002069	Glad to help.
TIH00002070	There was something else I needed...
TIH00002071	Yeah? What is it?
TIH00002072	On second thought, I'll be fine.
TIH00002073	It's your life.
TIH00002074	Can you heal my radiation?
TIH00002075	Absolutely, it's a snap.
TIH00002076	No, thanks.
TIH00002077	Whatever you say. If you're lucky you might develop super powers, but you'll probably just die a slow, agonizing death.
TIH00002078	Here's 100 caps. Do it.
TIH00002079	This will feel like... well, you don't want to know.
TIH00002080	I need medical supplies.
TIH00002081	Here's what I've got.
TIH00002082	I should get going.
TIH00002083	See you later.
TIH00002084	You look awfully familiar...
TIH00002085	I was wondering if you'd remember me. I used to run with the Fiends till you convinced me to check into rehab. It worked out pretty well.
TIH00002086	The NCR? Really? I didn't see that coming.
TIH00002087	When I left rehab, the only thing left was to find work in Westside, but they're not eager to have ex-Fiends around, so I enlisted.
TIH00002088	It got me out of that dump, at least. I might die at the Dam, but at least I'll die clean. I can handle that.
TIH00002089	I never thanked you for what you did. You saved my life, Courier. Nobody gave a damn about me until that point. Thank you.
TIH00002090	I need to get going.
TIH00002091	See you later.
TIH00002092	What a pussy. I liked you better when you were a junkie. <Attack>

TIH00002096	Caesar will cry when he sees what we have done to his men! They will weep for their mothers and beg for mercy! Kill them all!

TIH00002104	They breached the north wall! This is it, so dig deep and hold the fucking line!
TIH00002105	What does this note say?
TIH00002106	My translation is a little rough, but I think it means, "Enemies and Friends, I fuck them all in full." Only the Legion would get excited by that.
TIH00002107	What are you doing up here?
TIH00002108	The trees have a way of putting me at ease... and the cool air is easier on my lungs. It just seems more alive up here.
TIH00002109	Are you a merchant?
TIH00002110	In a manner of speaking, yeah. People come to me with questions, and I provide answers.
TIH00002111	I need to get going.
TIH00002112	See you later.
TIH00002113	Can you elaborate?
TIH00002114	Sometimes I can answer very specific questions... about the future. People place a lot of value in these answers.
TIH00002115	However, I can't do it too often because of the strain. I tend to get headaches when I concentrate on finding answers.
TIH00002116	It's like watching history in reverse... not everything comes through clearly. Even so, people always want to know what I see.
TIH00002117	People pay you for this? Good scam.
TIH00002118	It's not like that. I sell information that they probably can't find anywhere else.
TIH00002119	Can you answer any of my "Questions"?
TIH00002120	I guess I could. It will cost you 100 caps per question, with no refunds. I can only answer one question per day.
TIH00002121	I've heard enough of this mumbo-jumbo. Sell your snake oil to someone else, freak.
TIH00002122	Fine by me.
TIH00002123	That's fine. <Pay 100 caps>
TIH00002124	Ok, what's your question?
TIH00002125	I'm sorry, please come back when you've got enough caps.
TIH00002126	I don't have 100 caps.
TIH00002127	On second thought, I'll be going.
TIH00002128	Very well. Good luck out there.
TIH00002129	Will I come close to death again?
TIH00002130	The machine saved you, your head, bleeding in the dirt. Yes, it will happen again, but not the same. I see your blood... on snow and ice.
TIH00002131	There is death around you, and you are powerless, unable to move. You fight, you scream, but your hands... he makes you watch.
TIH00002132	The man in black tortures you... he laughs. He will break you. You will never be the same. I cannot... go on.
TIH00002133	Will I ever be enslaved?
TIH00002134	I cannot tell. But you are near it, you see them, amidst the rocks, dying in the sun. They rise, and you see it.
TIH00002135	They will fight against their master, the bull. It is wounded, but its vengeance is awful. You see them nailed into the crosses, screaming.
TIH00002136	They beg you, and... I cannot see. It, I... I don't know. I'm spent.
TIH00002137	Will I deliver any important messages?
TIH00002138	Hold still, and I'll find an answer. Yes, to a distant place, untouched by Bull or Bear, but divided between the brand and the plow.
TIH00002139	Your message will wait, you question your actions, the way of the gun, look for peace. I can't see... it's too much, I'm sorry.
TIH00002140	Will I go to war?
TIH00002141	War is always murky, deep in blood. Stay still. There is fighting... explosions, death. You are near the great river, you will decide it.
TIH00002142	Wait, there is another, sooner. There is dust, rocks, screaming. You are surrounded, and they come... they come by the hundreds. The Bull is strong.
TIH00002143	You will fight the Bull... and you will fight each other. The man with one eye, he wants to change the Bull, but must win first. No more!
TIH00002144	Who will be my greatest enemy?
TIH00002145	I see a man with a mask, strange hair, and talking. So much talking. He will not stop talking. But it is not him.
TIH00002146	There is another. It is cold, bitterly cold. All is white, you are numb. There are graves everywhere. He wears black. He laughs at you.
TIH00002147	He is silent, and laughs before he pulls the gun. That's all I can bear.
