SEV00000253	Yes?
SEV00000254	Welcome to the new clinic! It's a little rough around the edges, but we're already making a big difference here in Westside.
SEV00000255	I just can't thank you enough. Bless you... and bless Sam. He wasn't perfect, but he's left a wonderful legacy here.
SEV00000256	If I can ever help you in any way, please let me know.
SEV00000257	Yes?
SEV00000258	...
SEV00000259	What's your kink, baby? Threesomes? Butt stuff? You like a tongue in your ass? I'm down for anything if you got the caps, sugar.
SEV00000260	I'll be here if you change your mind.
SEV00000261	They sent you, didn't they? Came swooping in from the sky, stealing brahmin! I've seen them! Sweet Jesus on a unicorn, I seen them!
SEV00000262	Huh?
SEV00000263	<Singing>
SEV00000264	Can't get it out of my head!
SEV00000265	They're watching!
SEV00000266	[The child is sharpening his knife to a fine edge. He takes the time to finish before looking up at you.]
SEV00000267	The fuck do you want?
SEV00000268	What?
SEV00000269	Hey there, friends. You here to help with the food handouts? Some of these little tykes are real hungry... just desperate to get a single morsel.
SEV00000270	Can I help you?
SEV00000271	Didn't expect to see you fuckers again. Wait... did you do it? Is Marvin... you know? [He makes a slashing motion across his throat].
SEV00000272	Oh, I can see it in your eyes. He's deader than my stepdad. Burn in hell, Marvin. So, what can I do for you? Chems? Smokes? Knives?
SEV00000273	Yeah?
SEV00000274	Thank you for saving those kids.
SEV00000275	Please keep Patrick safe for me.
SEV00000276	You're just another lying ol' dirty birdy.
SEV00000277	...
SEV00000278	Yes?
SEV00000279	What is it?
SEV00000280	It's over. Not sure how I feel about all this. Been a while since I had a surge of adrenaline like that... not since I was serving.
SEV00000281	Maybe... maybe Jessica will rest a little easier. If her spirit is around, I suspect she's still cussing Bodeen's corpse. What a woman.
SEV00000282	I just... I know he had it coming... but now that it's done... was it right? Was it worth it?
SEV00000283	I'd rather not linger here. Grab the stash and we'll divvy it up, then we can go our separate ways.
SEV00000284	You better talk some sense into Lee or he's going to get himself killed.
SEV00000285	It's finished. I know Lee and I had our differences, but I never meant for him to go out like that. He died standing up.
SEV00000286	Not too sure what to make of this, though. Strange feeling. I wouldn't call it peace. No. Just... release. Like I can finally rest.
SEV00000287	Couldn't have done this without you. Wasn't sure what to think of you back at the outpost, but you sure as hell came through for me.
SEV00000288	Ain't one for speeches, so I'll end with thank you. Time to get those caps back to Silver Springs. Minus your share, of course.
SEV00000289	Goddamn it, Lee. Didn't leave us with any choice. Even with everything that happened... I didn't wish him dead. Damn shame.
SEV00000290	Thank you for backing me up. You could've gone with Lee just as easily. He was never big on sharing, though. Wise choice on your part.
SEV00000291	Couldn't have done this without you. Wasn't sure what to think of you back at the outpost, but you sure as hell came through for me.
SEV00000292	Ain't one for speeches, so I'll end with thank you. Time to get those caps back to Silver Springs. Minus your share, of course.
SEV00000293	Won't lie, I was betting that I'd have to throw down with him over the caps. Talking was never my strong suit. Glad you were here.
SEV00000294	Maybe Lee can find some peace out there. Same for you. If you do want to settle down, I'd stay away from Silver Springs. Maybe Goliad.
SEV00000295	My grandma always liked to quote the bible. She told me, "But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream."
SEV00000296	Wherever you go... whatever you do... be the river that bears justice. Lift up the oppressed... and drown their oppressors.
SEV00000297	Yeah?
SEV00000298	Not a good time.
SEV00000299	I must say that this has all gone swimmingly. It has all the makings of a tremendous country song.
SEV00000300	But first there are the pecuniary details. I know we discussed splitting the caps. That was... a prevarication on my part.
SEV00000301	I'm not a half-measure sort of guy. Nor do I like compromises. It's all or nothing. That's what I learned when my skin melted off.
SEV00000302	Rest in peace, Walker. Strange how these things happen. Gunfights, that is. Dime novels and newspapers make them out to be some elaborate dance.
SEV00000303	The Greeks put it well: "Quick decisions are not safe decisions." This is what Walker wanted, really. Gunsmoke, dust and a lot of dead bad guys.
SEV00000304	Me? I want to enjoy my retirement. On that note, it's time to divvy out the caps and go our separate ways. Fifty-fifty?
SEV00000305	Please, you can't let him do this.
SEV00000306	Keep the fuck back! You hear me? Stay away!
SEV00000307	Yeah?
SEV00000308	Never mind. I'll be going.
SEV00000309	Take care.
SEV00000310	Bye.
SEV00000311	Go! Run while you can! They're coming for us all!
SEV00000312	If you see Al... run away as fast as you can!
SEV00000313	Glasses! Get those glasses!
SEV00000314	Whatever you do, don't go to the lake!
SEV00000315	See you in Arizona, Al!
SEV00000316	Whatever.
SEV00000317	See you later.
SEV00000318	Very well.
SEV00000319	Take care.
SEV00000320	Stay out of my way when this starts.
SEV00000321	Whatever.
SEV00000322	So you are. Got a Pip-Boy, so you can navigate.
SEV00000323	[He looks you over with a skeptical expression across his face.]
SEV00000324	Have you killed?
SEV00000325	I'm here about the job.
SEV00000326	Reconsidered?
SEV00000327	I'd like to discuss the job again.
SEV00000328	Allow me to introduce myself. Patrick Lee - reformed robber, murderer, womanizer and all-around scoundrel, at your service!
SEV00000329	I'm a semi-willing participant in this bloody endeavor. It's a matter of reckoning for both of us, I suppose. Money for me, blood for Walker.
SEV00000330	To be clear... if you'd told me a few weeks ago I'd be working alongside Walker... I would've judged you insane. Life is strange.
SEV00000331	Who are you?
SEV00000332	Walker offered me a choice - throw in with him for monetary gain... or catch a bullet. I prefer caps over lead poisoning.
SEV00000333	Semi-willing participant?
SEV00000334	I'm ashamed to admit that I wasn't always a taxpaying citizen on the straight and narrow. Yes, I succumbed to temptation and vice.
SEV00000335	It was the folly of youth... well, ghoul youth. I threw in with Bodeen's pack of miscreants for the hope of short-term gain and worldly delights.
SEV00000336	Oh, and there were delights. Violent delights with violents ends, and I loved... er, I mean... I'm ashamed to admit it.
SEV00000337	All was well until I announced my intention to... retire. The lowly varmints beat me near to death and confiscated my share.
SEV00000338	So... after some time I set out to find these men and recover my wages. Walker found me first, so here we are. An enduring partnership.
SEV00000339	Why you?
SEV00000340	Again, youthful follies... I was... incarcerated in the Silver Springs jail for a time. Forcefully incarcerated. Very forcefully.
SEV00000341	Stubborn bastard tracked me all the way to Valley Wells. That's why we came in from the southwest. He's a determined man, I'll give him that.
SEV00000342	How did Walker know you?
SEV00000343	He is not my friend. He's... a business partner. A very temporary business partner.
SEV00000344	Who's your friend?
SEV00000345	The prevailing rumor is that Bodeen came from the east, ran with some real bad hombres in the Great Basin.
SEV00000346	You want details, talk to Lee. He ran with them for a little while.
SEV00000347	What can you tell me about this gang we're after?
SEV00000348	Grew up in Truckee, way up in the mountains west of Reno. Cold. Lots of snow. Beautiful, but unforgiving.
SEV00000349	Joined up young to get away, did a few years as a grunt, a few more with the rangers. Met a girl in Silver Springs and decided to settle down.
SEV00000350	Worked up there for a while. Pretty good life in hindsight, but all that's gone now. No point dwelling on it.
SEV00000351	Where are you from, originally?
SEV00000352	I failed. That's what happened.
SEV00000353	We've been working together for a bit. I'd like to know what happened in Silver Springs.
SEV00000354	One daughter who hates my guts... Hanna. I got Jessica pregnant when we were kids, and that was all she wrote. Spent the next few years deployed.
SEV00000355	I was a shit father from the start. Missed her childhood in the service, then mostly worked nights once I was sworn in as sheriff.
SEV00000356	Hannah was a strong-willed girl, definitely didn't mince words in our many arguments. She ran off with a dumb farm boy when they were sixteen.
SEV00000357	Jessica kept in touch with her. Last I heard she had one boy and another on the way. They live near Goliad, doing real well.
SEV00000358	Do you have any other family?
SEV00000359	I was a family man, believe it or not. Lived a quiet, tranquil life while I studied with the Followers. This was prior to my epidermal misfortunes.
SEV00000360	History was my passion, along with all manner of letters. My wife was a fellow academic... a great intellect. We were utterly devoted to each other.
SEV00000361	The Followers dispatched me to an archeological dig. I was accidently exposed to a lethal dose... what should have been a lethal dose of radiation.
SEV00000362	I returned to my loving spouse in this condition. She promptly divorced me and remarried a colleague. Later, I pushed them both down a well.
SEV00000363	What did you do before your time as an outlaw?
SEV00000364	The world over... well, the world west of the Rio Grande. I'd love nothing more than to see the plains. Legion is a stickler for rules, though.
SEV00000365	Most of my travels and travails have been confined to the Great Basin. It's a wild place, littered with strange towns and petty kingdoms.
SEV00000366	Much is made of the 80s. They're certainly dangerous to hapless damsels and witless caravaneers. I am neither. This is also why I stayed in gangs.
SEV00000367	Yes, they're often uneducated brutes, but there is... correction, there was mutual respect in the most Neolithic sense.
SEV00000368	I'm afraid things took a treacherous turn for the Bodeen Gang, hence my pursuit. Yes, there will be a reckoning.
SEV00000369	Where have you travelled?
SEV00000370	Interesting as in... homicidal? If so, then yes in the utmost. Conversation with killers is always more engaging, I've found.
SEV00000371	Mutual respect. Colorful anecdotes. The underlying threat of violence. Oh, it's titillating.
SEV00000372	There was El Reloj. Smooth... cold... like a reptile, but clearly haunted by something. Commanded great respect. Excellent Spanish, rare up there.
SEV00000373	Oh, I did meet the mutant Ares while I journeyed in Old Mexico. Utterly charismatic. Good command of mythology, obviously.
SEV00000374	It's not always pleasant. Take Requin. Saw him cut out a living captive's heart and eat it in front of his men. Laughed the whole time. A demon.
SEV00000375	Oh, there were others. Many others. There was one, though... well... a subject for another day, perhaps.
SEV00000376	Met any interesting people in your travels?
SEV00000377	Ah, yes. Bodeen the brute. Bodeen the snake. A cold-blooded, fork-tongued beast if there ever was one. No higher intellect, just low cunning.
SEV00000378	Adept with the gun, make no mistake. A pistolero on par with Walker and the other storied trigger-pullers of the wastes.
SEV00000379	But in the end... just a thug. A backwards step in evolution, made flesh. Homo Retro, if you will.
SEV00000380	Oh, and he's good with knives, blunt items, all the implements of the cave-dweller. He beat animals. He beat people. He even beat rocks.
SEV00000381	He was married to some tribal for a bit. Savage cunny, no doubt. Got a few kids out of her before she went to the great sweat lodge in the sky.
SEV00000382	What can you tell me about Bodeen?
SEV00000383	More? Certainly. He's a hideous specimen, sports a mammal on his face that doubles as a moustache. It's utterly repulsive.
SEV00000384	Always wears a unique duster, supposedly collected it from a Desert Ranger some time in the past. Many rumors about how that transpired.
SEV00000385	Story goes that prior to the Unification Treaty, one of the oldest hands in the rangers went after Bodeen. Name of... McCall, that's it.
SEV00000386	McCall tracked him deep into 80s territory. Too deep. Got bushwhacked by Bodeen and a band of 80s. Put up a hell of a fight, though.
SEV00000387	Bodeen has a funny gait when he shambles around, caveman that he is. Rumor is that he's carrying one of McCall's slugs in his thigh.
SEV00000388	Anything else you can tell me about Bodeen?
SEV00000389	A trifling pittance. No, that won't do. Rest assured I'm not going through all this for five percent. For that matter, neither should you.
SEV00000390	Walker mentioned you'd be getting a share of the recovered assets. Mind if I ask how much?
SEV00000391	Ah, Larch. Lord of the trash cans and rats, that one. Smelly beast who came up with that illustrious band of outlaws, the Jackals.
SEV00000392	He refused to conduct even the most basic hygiene... utterly intolerable. Even in the bush, where we all stunk... his stench shone through.
SEV00000393	You get me near some Jackals... and I reckon I can track his smell. Yes, I'm sure of it. Lead on, brave hero! We follow in your wake.
SEV00000394	What can you tell me about the first target?
SEV00000395	Terry Clinton, the gun nut. An arms dealer and smuggler. Supposedly even armed some of the 80s up north. Had a keen mind for business.
SEV00000396	He also had a keen nose for chems. A shame, really. Could've done something productive in the private sector. Well, so could I. But that's boring.
SEV00000397	Clinton had a deviant brother in the prison out here. Talked about meeting up with him, ripping off caravans once we finished the bank job.
SEV00000398	I imagine if we traced the caravan routes we could get a lead on them... or they could be waiting to ambush us. The Fates can be cruel.
SEV00000399	Walker said we're after someone named Clinton.
SEV00000400	The sharpshooter extraordinaire! A veritable Mozart with the rifle, minus the scatological fixation. Oh, that's relevant for you, Walker.
SEV00000401	"Lick me in the ass!" Relax, I was just quoting Mozart! I digress. Oh, Phillips. Yeah, he's got a singular obsession that exceeds all others.
SEV00000402	Deathclaws. Hunting them and collecting trophies. Man lives for it, year-round. So... know any places teeming with the beasts?
SEV00000403	What can you tell me about Jed Phillips?
SEV00000404	Ah, yes. The great hero of the NCR military! The undisputed master of stolen valor. He's Alexander reborn... well, according to him.
SEV00000405	Mason's purported exploits include single-handedly disemboweling an entire force of Legion scouts... with a spear in his thigh!
SEV00000406	As it happens... I managed to dig into his actual records thanks to a liaison with an admin clerk in Reno. His service record is... undistinguished.
SEV00000407	He received an administrative discharge shortly after arriving at his unit. Multiple instances of non-judicial punishment for malingering.
SEV00000408	According to one statement... he ate cigarettes and gargled his own urine to fake illness. He also developed an appetite for Psycho.
SEV00000409	He often moonlights as a guard for Crimson Caravan. All we need to do is draw him out off the compound. I'm sure you'll think of something.
SEV00000410	Walker said we're after a guy named Mason.
SEV00000411	Oh, this will be good. King of the perverts! Easy to find. Anywhere there's a great mass of diddlers, fiddlers and other deviants. He'll be there.
SEV00000412	Or more accurately, we should look for his minion, Marvin. That really rolls of the tongue. Minion Marvin. Anyway, he's the key.
SEV00000413	While I'm not suggesting you indulge in such indiscretions, I'm sure you know where such vermin congregate. Lead on!
SEV00000414	Fowler?
SEV00000415	"Guy" in the loosest sense of the word... a mutant. Not just a mutant, but a Nightkin, so the most... extra sort of mutant.
SEV00000416	A little conflicted about this one. We had something of a friendship, being the only freaks in the bunch.
SEV00000417	Not to mention he's surpisingly well-read on art history. Utterly obsessed with Rubens. Must like 'em thick. No judgment here.
SEV00000418	He's only mildly paranoid, which makes him a social butterfly by Nightkin standards. I'd wager he's up in that mountain town.
SEV00000419	The trick will be enticing him outside. My suggestion? Pose as an art dealer. Convince him that you have a Rubens. Say... Two Satyrs.
SEV00000420	Walker mentioned a guy named Sam.
SEV00000421	Yeah... about him. Some distance from here. Won't be alone. Has a passel of gunmen, raiders and other refuse at his shanty town.
SEV00000422	These rural, inbred types always seem to congregate in the worst mountain hovels. I suspect his clan is no different.
SEV00000423	Arrow Canyon, that's the place. He intends to set himself up as another petty warlord between here and Coyote Springs. Means to raid the 93, I wager.
SEV00000424	I know, uh... the general area. I reckon we can find it without a hitch. Meet us up at the Northern Passage and we'll begin our grand expedition.
SEV00000425	We're finally down to Bodeen.
SEV00000426	Clinton, the smuggler. Lee can fill you in.
SEV00000427	Who's next?
SEV00000428	Could be them. Seems like the convicts have a monopoly on bushwhacking here, so... good chance.
SEV00000429	I say we set up in cover a ways back, see if we can't wait them out. These groups tend to hit the same spots as long as they can get away with it.
SEV00000430	If we wait patiently, we should get the drop on them. Better than the alternative.
SEV00000431	What do you make of this?
SEV00000432	Now we hurry up and wait.
SEV00000433	<Wait for ambush> This seems like a good spot.
SEV00000434	Jed Phillips, the marksman. Lee knows him well.
SEV00000435	Who's next?
SEV00000436	Mason, the mercenary. Not a good friend of Lee's, if I recall.
SEV00000437	Who's next?
SEV00000438	Fowler, slimiest of the bunch by far. Looking forward to this one.
SEV00000439	Who's next?
SEV00000440	Our sure-fire ticket through the gate is dead now. Gonna need a kid to convincingly play the captive... not as easy as... wait a minute.
SEV00000441	I bet that Ronaldo kid could do it. He'll probably charge us an arm and a leg, but he's got moxy. Worth a shot.
SEV00000442	We know where Fowler is. The trick will be getting through the entrance.
SEV00000443	Sam, the safecracker. Before you talk to Lee, be sure to send Ronaldo home. Bad enough we got him mixed up in all this. And... thank you.
SEV00000444	Only two left. Who's next?
SEV00000445	He's a thief and a murderer. He'll keep stealing and killing until someone puts him down. He'll never change, no matter how he spins it.
SEV00000446	We've managed on our own so far. I'll give him a quick death, and that's being generous.
SEV00000447	He surrendered. Why don't we give him a chance to redeem himself?
SEV00000448	Yeah. Gonna have to work for it, though. Long trip, probably a real fight at the end. Lee can fill you in on the details.
SEV00000449	This is it, then. The last man.
SEV00000450	A little walking never hurt anyone. Let's get moving.
SEV00000451	Ready to travel?
SEV00000452	You'll do. I'm here to hunt down the men who robbed the bank in Silver Springs. I need a guide who knows the area.
SEV00000453	Pay is five percent of the recovered bank assets. Any other... forfeited assets along the way are yours, too.
SEV00000454	I've killed everything that walks or crawls at one time or another.
SEV00000455	Have you killed men? Specifically, men who are trying to kill you at the same time.
SEV00000456	So I ask again - have you killed?
SEV00000457	What do you mean?
SEV00000458	You'll do. I'm here to hunt down the men who robbed the bank in Silver Springs. I need a guide who knows the area.
SEV00000459	Pay is five percent of the recovered bank assets. Any other... forfeited assets along the way are yours, too.
SEV00000460	Yes.
SEV00000461	This might not be for you. If it's any assurance, all the men I'm after have it coming. But... if you got qualms... a nagging conscience... then no.
SEV00000462	So let me pose the question again - have you killed?
SEV00000463	I try to avoid killing.
SEV00000464	I'm going to hunt down and kill the men who robbed the bank in Silver Springs. You don't have to join in. Just need a steady guide.
SEV00000465	That said... we could be in some tight spots, and you'd be forced to defend yourself. Also don't want someone who's going to preach at me.
SEV00000466	Pay is five percent of the recovered bank assets. Any other... forfeited assets along the way are yours, too.
SEV00000467	What type of killing are you talking about?
SEV00000468	I was. Not anymore.
SEV00000469	You some kind of law?
SEV00000470	I'm not talking about this with you. Leave it alone.
SEV00000471	What, were you some kind of sheriff?
SEV00000472	Yes... and I'm not going to talk about it.
SEV00000473	This seems personal.
SEV00000474	You and Lee will get a share for labor provided... then I'll take the remainder back to the bank. Then... then it's over.
SEV00000475	What are you going to do with the recovered assets?
SEV00000476	Strictly speaking, no. We're not agents of the court or sworn officers. Part of your job is to lure our targets away from watchful eyes.
SEV00000477	All these men are outlaws. All of them are murderers. If you're going to fret over the legality of this, you should bow out.
SEV00000478	Is this legal?
SEV00000479	Silver Springs is just outside NCR. No official bounties with the agencies. Eventually... yes. Ain't gonna wait for competition, though.
SEV00000480	Can I collect bounties on these men?
SEV00000481	No.
SEV00000482	Aren't you a little worried about the legal consequences?
SEV00000483	First man is Larch. Scum came up with the Jackals out here. Talk to Lee for details. I'm behind you.
SEV00000484	I'm in. Let's get started.
SEV00000485	Don't take too long. I'll hire someone else if they're competent.
SEV00000486	I need some time to think about it.
SEV00000487	Fat chance of that happening. You seen the bumpkins passing through this shithole? Lucky if they can walk in a straight line without tripping.
SEV00000488	Hallelujah and hail Mary, let the righteous slaughter begin! I for one am excited to be leaving this dusty sphincter. Lead on, sheriff!
SEV00000489	All right, let's see what we're working with.
SEV00000490	<Sniffing>
SEV00000491	I... yeah, I got something. Terminal swamp ass... and shit-covered leather. Yeah, that's him!
SEV00000492	<Sniffing>
SEV00000493	Ugh, a hint of halitosis mingled with rotten meat... and it's not me. Getting closer.
SEV00000494	<Sniffing>
SEV00000495	Oh, he's... well, I'll just go fuck myself.
SEV00000496	Seems a little harsh. Could've just made him take a bath.
SEV00000497	"Call no man happy till he is dead." That's what the Greeks said. Well, this guy is positively jubilant.
SEV00000498	We're just gonna bushwhack 'em? Not gonna tell him something cold-blooded first? That's what revenge is all about!
SEV00000499	Look, he can count.
SEV00000500	Now what is a perfectly good mole rat doing... oh, fuck.
SEV00000501	I'm sure Bodeen will say the same thing about Silver Springs. Look on the bright side - you got two for the price of one!
SEV00000502	"O Rose, thou art sick."
SEV00000503	Whatever I am... whatever I've done... I don't hurt kids.
SEV00000504	Walker, he has a point. I sort of know the way to Arrow Canyon. I don't know-know it. Could be useful to keep Sam along.
SEV00000505	Damn hobos and their sob stories. Whole yarn was a farce, most likely. Sky wagons? A mass murderer named Al? Wasteland myth.
SEV00000506	Maybe he went for a walk. I find a walks to be deeply invigorating, provided they're not with you, Walker.
SEV00000507	That worked out nicely. Get Bodeen's key and grab the loot. I'll be right here.
SEV00000508	"Manners maketh man." This is a pleasant surprise. Here I was expecting another illiterate beast... and you've gone and impressed me.
SEV00000509	<Shake his hand> I'm &PCName;. Nice to meet you.
SEV00000510	Likewise. I hope our partnership is profitable for all.
SEV00000511	Good to meet you.
SEV00000512	Oh, so that's your part in this. I recall the Bard: "Our very eyes... are sometimes like our judgments, blind."
SEV00000513	You play your games and I'll play mine. Maybe we'll both come out of this alive and a little richer.
SEV00000514	Don't get chummy with me, bub. I can see through your bullshit.
SEV00000515	Stand and deliver! It's your caps or your lives, trespassers!
SEV00000516	Hello, Larch.
SEV00000517	Walker? Lee? What... what are you doing here?
SEV00000518	You know why we're here, young man. Make your peace and get ready.
SEV00000519	Whoa, whoa, whoa! I was just the lookout, see? I had debts, just needed a little to get back on my feet! It was Bodeen, all Bodeen!
SEV00000520	Please, they wouldn't even let me do jobs with them! Ask Lee, he'll tell you! I was just a lookout, never hurt anybody!
SEV00000521	He ain't lying, Walker. Besides... he's pretty pathetic. How about we just take his caps, sanitize them, and then get on to the real outlaws?
SEV00000522	No. For Jessica.
SEV00000523	That's one.
SEV00000524	Here they come. Wait until they're all in our line of sight, then open up with whatever will cause the most casualties.
SEV00000525	I'll say it to him in hell. Now shut up.
SEV00000526	Two.
SEV00000527	Damn, that is not what I wanted. Didn't give me a choice.
SEV00000528	We'll be outside the compound. Try not to cause a scene in there... unless he starts it.
SEV00000529	I wanted to question him first. See if you can find something useful on him.
SEV00000530	Five. Burn in hell, scum.
SEV00000531	Same deal, we'll be waiting outside town. Don't cause any trouble in there.
SEV00000532	Something's off. We just cleaned out the canyon, he still hasn't shown. Check out the admin building, see if he slipped out.
SEV00000533	Just take a quick look inside, see if he left any notes. We'll be watching the street.
SEV00000534	It's done. Grab the key and get the cash from the safe. I'll be out here... something I have to do.
SEV00000535	This is going to be tedious. Waiting around so we can ambush the ambushers. Wish I'd brought a book. For Whom the Bell Tolls would be fitting.
SEV00000536	Walker... can I call you my little rabbit?
SEV00000537	You call me that and I'll shoot your kneecaps off.
SEV00000538	Un dia pronto... te matare. Estupido paleto.
SEV00000539	What was that?
SEV00000540	I was just complimenting your stunning intellect, Walker. You're a marvel to behold. So happy to be here with you.
SEV00000541	Hey, at least he doesn't like collecting Cazador venom. That's the secret of my optimism - remember it can always be so much worse.
SEV00000542	You've got to be fucking kidding me.
SEV00000543	Then lead on to the great hunting grounds. I'll be... well behind you and Wild Bill the Second while you tilt at Deathclaw-shaped windmills.
SEV00000544	He'll probably be at Sloan.
SEV00000545	Then lead on to the great hunting grounds. I'll be... well behind you and Wild Bill the Second while you tilt at Deathclaw-shaped windmills.
SEV00000546	I might know a place.
SEV00000547	I haven't the need nor the urge to hide it. She was a rancid, shallow cow, and it warmed my soul to see her thrash like a goldfish.
SEV00000548	I do regret killing Bill, though. Amazing linguist, loved his work on language isolates. I think he screeched in Basque and Ainu while drowning.
SEV00000549	I won't pontificate about some grand, internal transformation. It was just an epiphany, nothing more. I live freely now, and I don't look back.
SEV00000550	You're very open about killing your former spouse.
SEV00000551	Oh, don't be. In hindsight, she was a domineering she-beast... closer to Shelob in temperament, apt to suck the joy out of me... but never my seed.
SEV00000552	It was some time ago, too. If not for the blessings of the atom, I'd be buried in some simple plot back in California, long forgotten.
SEV00000553	I'm sorry you had to go through that.
SEV00000554	Friend, I'm all seven courses of shit and I'm delicious. You don't even know the half of it. I'm just living to the fullest. You should try it.
SEV00000555	You're a piece of shit.
SEV00000556	[SUCCEEDED] Very well, no point in prevaricating. I... may have pilfered a tiny sum from Bodeen. He overreacted, beast that he is.
SEV00000557	No dialogue, no discourse, just a primitive beating. Forfeiture of shares and banishment would've sufficed. Wouldn't have been my first time.
SEV00000558	No, he made a point to humiliate and degrade me. Like my wife did. You remember how that turned out for her, right?
SEV00000559	C'mon. Don't bullshit a bullshitter. What really happened?
SEV00000560	[FAILED] I'll refrain, thank you very much.
SEV00000561	Tell me your secret and I'll tell you mine.
SEV00000562	Very well. In Utah I spoke with that infamous Booth fellow for a brief moment. Imposing... dangerous... and utterly obnoxious.
SEV00000563	I recall Euripides: "He was a god of words... and words are not enough." I preferred his brother.
SEV00000564	I know you want to finish that sentence. What were you going to say? You can tell me.
SEV00000565	Thank you, but I most certainly will not. I find babyish fits of rage to be very unpersuasive.
SEV00000566	FINISH THE SENTENCE!
SEV00000567	Whoa, he went down hard! Mole rat meat and the Macomber call get them every time! Whoo!
SEV00000568	Ya'll just wandered right up to the bait... almost became bait yourselves. You taking the scenic route or something? Wait, hold on...
SEV00000569	Patrick? Sheriff Walker? What in blue blazes are you doing here?
SEV00000570	I'm here to settle with you, Jed. For Jessica.
SEV00000571	Whoa, whoa. I get it... I do. You see I'm with my wife, right? We got married a few weeks back. She's a civilian, through and through.
SEV00000572	We have a boy, you know? Was shacked up off an on for years. He's damn near four, up at her mama's now. I did it to support them.
SEV00000573	I... I know I don't deserve it... but I'm asking you... let me walk out of here so I can support my family. You'll never see me again.
SEV00000574	Only thing I'm pulling the trigger on is deathclaws so I can put food on the table. Never liked the work with Bodeen. Not going back to it.
SEV00000575	No. You don't get to hide behind your family. Their suffering is on your head. You made your choices, took the easy way with Bodeen.
SEV00000576	Wasn't just me you hurt. I know all about those caravans. The robbing, the raping, the murder. I know what you are... what you'll always be.
SEV00000577	Your wife can walk out of here, which is more than you or Bodeen would've offered. Ma'am, you'd best be on your way home.
SEV00000578	Mister, you don't get tell me what to do. You ain't no law. You don't get to threaten us here. We have laws, judges and courts.
SEV00000579	Jed, I'm staying here with you. You hear that, bushwhackers? I'm not going anywhere!
SEV00000580	Words, words, words. Kill them both and let's go.
SEV00000581	Lee, shut your fucking mouth. Jed, say your goodbyes. Ma'am, go home. Go home.
SEV00000582	Honey, think of our boy. Tommy needs you. I love you. Go. Go now.
SEV00000583	Piss on that. These people are cowards. Just petty bushwhackers. You hear that, you sonofabitch? You need to leave.
SEV00000584	The girl has sand. Do it, I believe in you, sister!
SEV00000585	Ma'am, put that gun down. Put it down and walk away. Jed, get control of her. I will defend myself.
SEV00000586	No, he's gonna hurt us! I don't believe him... he's just another raider, gonna take advantage of us. I won't let him do it! I won't!
SEV00000587	Hey there, hero.
SEV00000588	Lee? What the... uh, Sheriff Walker. What, uh.. what brings you here?
SEV00000589	You know why we're here, son. Got anything to say for yourself?
SEV00000590	Whoa, hold on. I didn't pull the trigger there. Bodeen. It was all him. Shit, I tried to hold him back. I was the only one who stood up to him!
SEV00000591	Lee, you tell him! You remember how it was!
SEV00000592	I recall... a certain lackey who kept his nose right up Bodeen's ass, dawn to dusk. Boy, did you try... even dressed like him. The duster, remember?
SEV00000593	Nah, I suspect you were right there egging him on. "Great shot, Bodeen." That's what you always said, right? Truckling little weasel.
SEV00000594	That wasn't my fault! None of it was my fault! You... you can't do this. I served, remember? Isn't that worth something?
SEV00000595	So did I.
SEV00000596	He doesn't get to walk... live a normal, happy life. No, I won't stand for it.
SEV00000597	I think you should let him go.
SEV00000598	Yeah, I just... no, can't be helped.
SEV00000599	Quit fiddlefarting around and kill him.
SEV00000600	[SUCCEEDED] This doesn't sit well with me... but yeah... you're right. That woman is innocent. Jessica wouldn't want her harmed.
SEV00000601	There will be another time and place. Don't risk killing an innocent. You're better than that.
SEV00000602	[FAILED] Sorry? He can say it to the devil.
SEV00000603	Hey, he said he was sorry.
SEV00000604	I... uh, okay. Yeah, it's the right thing. I'll do it.
SEV00000605	Let him go or the next grave is yours.
SEV00000606	You have... it's just... I honestly don't like talking about it. But you have put your ass on the line for me, so I'll tell you the truth.
SEV00000607	You might've heard Lee call me "Sheriff". It's true, I wore a star for years up in Silver Springs. Was respected, known for being fair... and tough.
SEV00000608	Behind that reputation for toughness was... well, a lot of anger. I wanted all the raiders and scum in the basin to know my town was off-limits.
SEV00000609	It worked well, for a time. But anger is... well, it's a drug. A blinding, intoxicating drug. It was a high for me, tuning up raiders or riff-raff.
SEV00000610	Got to where my own people got to be scared of me. They wanted someone more... amicable, friendly. Voted my ass out.
SEV00000611	I'm putting my life on the line for you. It's important that we trust each other.
SEV00000612	I suspect it ain't your first time killing men for caps, didn't figure you'd be so curious. It is worth killing over, though. Worth dying... for me.
SEV00000613	You might've heard Lee call me "Sheriff". It's true, I wore a star for years up in Silver Springs. Was respected, known for being fair... and tough.
SEV00000614	Behind that reputation for toughness was... well, a lot of anger. I wanted all the raiders and scum in the basin to know my town was off-limits.
SEV00000615	It worked well, for a time. But anger is... well, it's a drug. A blinding, intoxicating drug. It was a high for me, tuning up raiders or riff-raff.
SEV00000616	Got to where my own people got to be scared of me. They wanted someone more... amicable, friendly. Voted my ass out.
SEV00000617	If this is worth killing men over, I'd like to know the reason why.
SEV00000618	Town put a politician in charge, real friendly... people person. I could've stayed on as a deputy, but... couldn't do it.
SEV00000619	Because I was stubborn, refused to work as a deputy... my wife took up a position as a clerk at the bank, just to keep us afloat.
SEV00000620	Bodeen and his boys hit the bank... Jessica was the only one that stood up to them. She was stubborn... strong. So they killed her.
SEV00000621	Bodeen executed her... that's why I'm saving him for last. Might be another grave after his. That's what I deserve, anyway.
SEV00000622	Go on, I'm listening.
SEV00000623	Yeah. I figured as much. Let's get back to work.
SEV00000624	<Yawn>
SEV00000625	I had a hand in it, to be sure. Even if I were just a deputy, presence alone might've deterred Bodeen. But I had to be cock of the walk.
SEV00000626	Well, doesn't matter. They're getting me now. I'll hunt Bodeen all the way to Baja if I have to.
SEV00000627	That wasn't your fault. Bodeen and his men did this, and they're going to pay.
SEV00000628	It was the best part of the job when I had the chance to do it... which was rare. More often than not I was corralling drunks.
SEV00000629	Hard to think about right now. I've been so focused on this... sad part is that it's given me real purpose for the first time in years.
SEV00000630	Hell of a thing to admit... I've been a better husband to Jessica since she's been dead than I ever was while she was alive.
SEV00000631	Maybe... maybe I will start over. Figure some of these frontier towns can use a lawman. No point dreaming right now, though.
SEV00000632	You can still help people after all this is done. Go someplace new and start over.
SEV00000633	Yeah, outright giving up doesn't sit well with me. I just don't know what I'll do after this... if I'll be worth a damn at honest work.
SEV00000634	That's a problem for tomorrow, frankly. Right now let's focus on killing these bastards.
SEV00000635	I pictured you as more of a fighter. Don't see you giving up after this.
SEV00000636	Maybe. Maybe not. We'll see.
SEV00000637	Do it. I'm not sure if you can come back from something like that.
SEV00000638	Waiting for the next job. Gonna be guarding a caravan from here to the Mojave Outpost. Might get hairy. Good thing they have me watching them.
SEV00000639	Talk to Alice if you're looking for work. She's been fair with me from day one. Not too concerned about past employment, if you know what I mean.
SEV00000640	What are you doing here?
SEV00000641	Let's just say that you learn a lot about guarding caravans once you've... been on the other side of things.
SEV00000642	Nothing too crazy, certainly never hit Crimson Caravan or any of the other big players. Just small stuff. You learn what not to do.
SEV00000643	What kind of "Past Employment"?
SEV00000644	It was all outside NCR, way up in the Great Basin. Different world up there. Towns and warlords fighting, everyone is raiding each other.
SEV00000645	Look, I'm no angel, but I never got mixed up in hurting citizens... except maybe once. Part of the reason I'm down here.
SEV00000646	No, I figure it's best to leave that part of my life behind and play it straight for a while. Plenty of caps to be made down here.
SEV00000647	You seem pretty open about your past.
SEV00000648	Okay, I'm listening.
SEV00000649	I might have an interesting business proposal for you.
SEV00000650	Goddamn right I served. I was a combat culinary specialist. Basically infantry.
SEV00000651	I fought the Legion at Parker Dam. Killed a centurion in single combat. Would've gotten a battlefield commission... but I got fucked over.
SEV00000652	Just be aware... if we work together, sometimes I get flashbacks... and snap! I'm back there fighting!
SEV00000653	[He produces a knife and waves it erratically for several moments. This is an intensely-choreographed yet wholly unimpressive performance.]
SEV00000654	That's how I fucking do it, man. I just see fucking red and I go! Raiders won't fuck with us. Legion? Fuck no, they see me and they run.
SEV00000655	You're a veteran?
SEV00000656	Whoa, say what? Who you been talking to? What did they say?
SEV00000657	That's interesting. I heard a different story about your enlistment.
SEV00000658	[SUCCEEDED] Who... who the fuck told you that? I'm a hero, goddamn it! A hero! I'm not gonna take this shit!
SEV00000659	<Provoke.> I heard... you gargled your own piss and ate cigarettes so you could fake an illness.
SEV00000660	[FAILED] Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you for recognizing my sacrifices.
SEV00000661	Nevermind, thank you for your service.
SEV00000662	Okay, but you better not be fucking with me. It was goddamn Sergeant Parker, wasn't it? Fucking bully! Smoke me? I'll smoke you!
SEV00000663	I'll meet you outside. I'm gonna have words with whoever is spreading this bullshit!
SEV00000664	I can't say it here. Meet me outside and I'll tell you.
SEV00000665	Hey, put that shit away. Of course I'm interested. I'll buy it in bulk if you got it. Meet me outside. Fucking discretion, man.
SEV00000666	<Show Psycho> I got a strong supplier if you're in the market.
SEV00000667	Marvin? Don't know him. I can be your Marvin if you need. Got a homemade strap-on that I can lube up for you. Fifty caps and I'm yours, sugar.
SEV00000668	I'm looking for a guy named Marvin. You seen him?
SEV00000669	Yeah, it's some Da Vinci shit. Rebar core with a rubber exterior, firm and girthy. That's how you like it, don't you?
SEV00000670	[She thrusts her hips in a suggestive manner while licking her lips. You notice droplets of an unspecified bodily fluid on her clothing.]
SEV00000671	How about it, honey? You need mama to take care of you and your friends? They can play too, even the ghoul. I don't discriminate.
SEV00000672	A homemade strap-on?
SEV00000673	Don't be a stranger.
SEV00000674	No thanks.
SEV00000675	Silver wagons in the stars... bright... warm light. Then I was up there. They poked me! Put things in me! Nobody believes me! Do you believe me?
SEV00000676	They? Who are you talking about?
SEV00000677	Then you get it... maybe you've seen them. They're everywhere, you know... gotta have special glasses to see them. Magical glasses.
SEV00000678	I had 'em, but an invisible man stole 'em from me. Asked him his name. "Nobody," he said. Look out for an invisible man with sunglasses!
SEV00000679	Sure, I believe you.
SEV00000680	He knows too much... seen even more than me. He stays hidden so they can't catch him or probe him again. Wish I had those glasses...
SEV00000681	I'll do that.
SEV00000682	I knew a Marvin. We served together in Baja. Machine gunner. Funny guy, liked to tell jokes. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific.
SEV00000683	I'm looking for a guy named Marvin. Have you seen him?
SEV00000684	Don't know any Marvins in Freeside. I know an Al. Is that you, Al? It's been a long time, but I remember everything... I was there!
SEV00000685	I remember how you shot those kids and laughed... how you sang those songs. I'll never forget that laugh. I still hear it at night. I can't sleep.
SEV00000686	You thought I was gone, didn't you? I never left, Al. Just went away for a while... I'm... I'm just getting warmed up!
SEV00000687	Sorry about that. The Marvin I'm looking for is a young man, should be here in Freeside.
SEV00000688	Could be Al in disguise. He has many names, you know. Fancied himself a doctor at one point. Killed all his patients. Stay. Away. From. Al.
SEV00000689	If it ain't Al... the boy might know. Stays by the big gate with the robots. He's a survivor. Escaped a madman's dungeon, that's what I heard.
SEV00000690	I'm a survivor, too! Survived two enlistments! Why did I re-enlist? Because of brain damage, that's why! Used explosives. Broke my brain.
SEV00000691	So... you don't know Marvin?
SEV00000692	My pleasure. Have you ever seen what a shaped charge does to a child's skull? Perfect. Circle. That's what it does. It's a work of art.
SEV00000693	Saw Al do it, back when he had the full team. Amazing chemistry. Killed a lot of bad men. Women and children, too. Those were the days.
SEV00000694	I lost my way, Al. I wandered far and wide. Saw things you can't imagine. I found myself out there... something snapped in me.
SEV00000695	I had to come back... back to Vegas. I'll never leave... not until I'm dead or the sky wagons snatch me... or I get recalled to active duty.
SEV00000696	Thanks for the information. I should be going.
SEV00000697	Because it's time. They thought we were finished. Nothing is finished. Find them, bring them back. You'll need them all!
SEV00000698	I had a vision up in that sky wagon... I saw the future. There's gonna be enough blood for ten lifetimes, Al! You'll need everyone!
SEV00000699	They told me to leave this town, called me crazy. Said I was old, done, washed up. I won't do it, Al. By God, I'm gonna light this town on fire!
SEV00000700	Why are you telling me this?
SEV00000701	[He gulps down a clear liquid from a liquor bottle.]
SEV00000702	That's my help. Know why? It's water. Pure, high-quality H20! I gave up drinking, Al! It's a miracle! I'm renewed... effervescent!
SEV00000703	They thought I was crazy before... I was just drunk. You're gonna see both barrels filled with batshit crazy soon. Mark my words, Al.
SEV00000704	I think you should get some help.
SEV00000705	Oh, you gonna fucking make me? I'll talk how I want to any roaming cockwagon in this town, got it? I'm gonna run Freeside one day!
SEV00000706	High and mighty ass... I just had radroach for dinner! You gonna preach about cussing when I'm missing meals? Being hungry fucking sucks!
SEV00000707	And don't give me that do-good bullshit about "Profanity is a sign of bad character." Last night a hobo tried to molest me! That's bad character!
SEV00000708	You should watch your mouth.
SEV00000709	Relax? I don't think so. Know what I've had to do to survive up here? I fucking escaped a dungeon. A fucking crazy man locked me in his dungeon.
SEV00000710	Me and a bunch of other kids, all locked up. Enslaved. Think I survived by talking pretty and being polite? Fuck that. Bet your ass I'm mean.
SEV00000711	Next asshole who tries to throw me in a dungeon is getting it, and I'm talking about next-level shit!
SEV00000712	[He demonstrates his ability with the knife by performing a series of swift yet smooth slicing motions. He is clearly adept with the blade.]
SEV00000713	Relax, I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just trying to find Marvin.
SEV00000714	Oh, you're one of those types. Listen up, perverts. Any of you try to touch me and I'll stab you right in the feminine artery.
SEV00000715	You might get me in a rush, but one of you is gonna bleed out here. You wanna fucking try me? C'mon! Let's go!
SEV00000716	I'm looking for a guy named Marvin. You know him?
SEV00000717	Wait, you're just here to kill people? Shit, why didn't you say so? One hundred caps or three cartons of smokes. That's the going rate.
SEV00000718	Whoa, it's not like that! We're trying to track down Marvin's boss so we can settle a score.
SEV00000719	Caps or smokes. What's it gonna be?
SEV00000720	I'd like to get information on Marvin's whereabouts.
SEV00000721	Smooth and mild, just how my clients like 'em. Gonna get a nice return on these. Marvin likes to camp out by the old watchtower back there.
SEV00000722	Obvious ruse, offering sandwiches and candy. Just... hurt him for me, okay? He took one of my friends who was hungry. Make him bleed.
SEV00000723	<Give three cartons of cigarettes> Here you go.
SEV00000724	Nice doing business with you. Marvin likes to camp out by the old watchtower. Paid off some of the Kings and guards, slips in and out at night.
SEV00000725	Obvious scam, offering food and candy. Just... hurt him for me, okay? He took one of my friends who was hungry. Make him bleed.
SEV00000726	<Pay 100 caps> Here's the caps.
SEV00000727	Hey, thanks. I practice everyday. This little baby has saved my hide... and other things... more than once.
SEV00000728	Tell you what... out of professional courtesy, I'm gonna hand you Marvin. He likes to camp out by the old watchtower back there.
SEV00000729	Obvious ruse, offering sandwiches and candy. Just... hurt him for me, okay? He took one of my friends who was hungry. Make him bleed.
SEV00000730	Not bad. You've got real talent.
SEV00000731	"It looks sharp." That's more than I can say for you, dumbass. Better believe I keep it sharp. Saved me more than once.
SEV00000732	Creepy-ass old man says, "Come here, little boy. I got a present for you." Tries to grab me... Pow! Right through the Antilles tendon!
SEV00000733	So, yeah... knives are good. Sharp knives are gooder. Got it? Good.
SEV00000734	That looks sharp. You should be careful.
SEV00000735	Wait, you want me to play some raggedy-ass victim? "Mister, I'm so hungry, of course I'll follow you into the dark alley." Like that?
SEV00000736	Look, I support what you're doing, so I'll give you a discount: two hundred caps. I'm a professional, and you get what you pay for.
SEV00000737	We need you to act like a captive so we can break into a dungeon and kill a guy.
SEV00000738	Finally come around? Not a lot of willing or able actors of my caliber wandering around Freeside. Let's see the caps.
SEV00000739	I'd like to discuss hiring you to act as a captive.
SEV00000740	Don't mention it. Beats hunting rats and stabbing bums. Guess it's back to the old routine in Freeside.
SEV00000741	This little outing got me thinking... might be fun to see some other places. What do you think?
SEV00000742	Thanks for all your help, but I think it's time for you to go home.
SEV00000743	Remember, kids - I'll have more food for you tomorrow. I might even have some chocolate, so bring your friends!
SEV00000744	Fowler? I don't know any Fowler. I'm a local, see. I'm just here to help out these kids.
SEV00000745	I'm looking for information on your boss, Fowler.
SEV00000746	[He recoils from the blow and then doubles over, unable to breath. It takes him several moments to compose himself.]
SEV00000747	Okay, okay! He... he's at the hideout by the Northern Passage. Calls it "The Junction". Ships most of their kids up north.
SEV00000748	Wait! You'll need me to get in. I have to escort you... unless you've got a kid to sell. Give me a moment and I'll take you there.
SEV00000749	<Punch him in the liver> This is just a taste of the pain I can dish out. Give me Fowler.
SEV00000750	Uh, uh, uh... he, he's at a place. It's called "The Junction". By the Northern Passage. All the kids are there. Ships them north. Lots of buyers.
SEV00000751	Need me to get in, unless you're bringing a kid to sell. Can't get in if you kill me, okay? Please don't hurt me. I'm just doing my job!
SEV00000752	Give me Fowler or I'll hang you from that overpass and empty your guts out for the rats to eat.
SEV00000753	Hey, that's a serious accusation! You are way off-base. I'm a resident of New Vegas. I'm taking time out of my day to help these kids.
SEV00000754	This... this is a paranoid delusion. Go play vigilante with someone else. I wouldn't hurt anyone.
SEV00000755	I know you're taking kids to Fowler. Tell us where he is and you might live to see tomorrow.
SEV00000756	Then you understand. We're just meeting the desires of our clients, nothing more. Who's to say that one desire is worse than the others?
SEV00000757	Fowler runs a hidden pleasure den to the north, "The Junction". We keep the property there before shipping most of them up north.
SEV00000758	You'll have to have me escort you if you want to get in. Otherwise you have to bring captives to sell. Only children. Extra for redheads...
SEV00000759	We all have our hidden urges. I just want to talk business with Fowler, nothing more.
SEV00000760	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, okay. Can't be too careful with all these do-gooders around. Bad enough I have to pay off these local hoodlums.
SEV00000761	Fowler runs a joint called "The Junction" up by the Northern Passage. It's well-hidden. Entrance is very secure.
SEV00000762	You'll need me to escort you unless you're bringing a live captive. We can head that way as soon as you're ready.
SEV00000763	<Lie> Marvin, it's okay. We're not here to hurt anybody. We just want to talk business.
SEV00000764	[FAILED] Uh, I don't know what you're talking about... furthermore, your argument is... flawed.
SEV00000765	Kids these days are lazy. Spending time in slavery will instill a strong work ethic.
SEV00000766	Born here, fucker. Mom left me with the Followers and they did their best. I'm just too much of a badass for those nerds.
SEV00000767	Got enslaved for a bit but eventually escaped. Seen a lot of my friends get snatched up over the years. They just disappear.
SEV00000768	How'd you end up in Freeside?
SEV00000769	Yeah, more or less. Weren't no collars or chains but that's what it was. Called it indented certitude or something... but it's slavery.
SEV00000770	Head honcho guy was easily distracted, so I slipped away first chance I got. Some others might've gotten out, too. Heard shotgun blasts as I ran.
SEV00000771	Funny... the thing I remember is the singing. Whenever I stab a hobo... I imagine it's him. It makes the voices quiet for a little while.
SEV00000772	You were enslaved?
SEV00000773	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, okay. Never let it be said that Ronaldo doesn't help his friends, okay? They won't suspect a thing, I promise.
SEV00000774	The world is minus one Marvin thanks to us. How about a gesture of friendship?
SEV00000775	[FAILED] Hell no, most of those little bastards are my competition! I'm scrapping day and night just to get a piece of rat.
SEV00000776	Don't you want to help save your friends?
SEV00000777	I'm a fucking bargain, you'll see. "Mister, I'm so lonely. Please take me back to your dark dungeon." Then we'll butcher those perverts!
SEV00000778	<Pay 200 caps> Here's the caps. You better be worth it.
SEV00000779	I like your moxy. Gonna kill my margins, but since it's for a good cause... fine, I'm in. Now let's go stab some perverts!
SEV00000780	I know you want to knife these bastards. You should be paying me. Make it a hundred.
SEV00000781	Most of these kids are idiots or downright feral. Good luck catching them, much less having a conversation.
SEV00000782	Yeah, go ahead with that. Try the crier twerp. He pisses all over himself when he's nervous, not to mention he shrieks. High quality.
SEV00000783	I bet one of these other kids would do it for less. Fifty caps is my final offer.
SEV00000784	Not a redhead, so it's standard rates. Special client likes the gingers. We got booze and chems, so make yourself at home...
SEV00000785	Get ready to bleed, perverts!
SEV00000786	Why in the sweet cinnamon fuck would I do that? I'd be bored out of my mind sitting around in that crappy, old fort.
SEV00000787	I think you should join the Followers and get an education.
SEV00000788	I, uh... yes, yes! I'll do it! I'll hit the books, no acting up! I swear on my mama's grave!
SEV00000789	Start studying with the Followers or I'll beat your ass like I was your daddy.
SEV00000790	I, uh... yes, yes! I'll do it! I'll hit the books, no acting up! I swear on my mama's grave!
SEV00000791	Start studying with the Followers or I'll beat your ass like I was your momma.
SEV00000792	[SUCCEEDED] Well... okay, I'll give them another shot. I'll try to be... less bad. I won't stab anyone, but no promises on fistfights!
SEV00000793	Stay hard and keep killing perverts for me.
SEV00000794	Freeside is a dead end. The Followers are your best ticket out of there.
SEV00000795	[FAILED] Bullshit. Virtue is not a reward. Rewards are the damn rewards! I want caps! Dinner that isn't roaches or rats! That's a fucking reward!
SEV00000796	The Followers will help you lead a virtuous life, and that is its own reward.
SEV00000797	Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks for the advice. Never pictured myself tied to one place anyway. Don't go getting soft. No mercy to perverts.
SEV00000798	The world is a lot bigger than Freeside. Hit the road and don't look back. You'll be fine.
SEV00000799	Well... thanks? Fuck it, I had fun. Good luck with your killing spree. See you around.
SEV00000800	Not my problem, kid. Do what you want.
SEV00000801	Lee, is that you? What are you doing here?
SEV00000802	Anne, I... just didn't expect to run into you. I'm... uh, I'm helping a friend.
SEV00000803	Really? Well, I... that's good to hear. As for me... I got caught trying to bust these kids out. Thanks for freeing them... and me.
SEV00000804	Couldn't get the Kings or anyone from NCR to lift a finger, so you know me... had to do something. Not as sneaky as I used to be.
SEV00000805	Kids have been going missing for months. It's tough. We could sure use your help back in Freeside. You were always a good teacher, Patrick.
SEV00000806	I... I, uh... there's no chance, Anne. Not after all I've done. You don't even know the half of it. Can't go back to it.
SEV00000807	I know you're not an angel, Patrick. Most of that was so long ago that the smoothies wouldn't remember. I know you aren't all bad inside.
SEV00000808	Whatever you've done, I'd certainly be willing to forgive you if you started clean. You ain't Edward Sallow, honey. Help others and you'll heal.
SEV00000809	I... I wasn't ready for this. To see you, to hear this. Truth is... hard to forgive myself, not sure if I could do it.
SEV00000810	Even if... I got pressing business with these folks. Probably won't see you again, Anne. Please stay safe... and don't do this again.
SEV00000811	Forgive as the Lord forgave you, Patrick. Don't forget it. I... I still think of you. Stay safe.
SEV00000812	Goodbye, Anne.
SEV00000813	I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention that conversation to anyone, especially Walker.
SEV00000814	Anne, a scientist I worked with... closely. She was at the dig site when I got exposed... nursed me as I inched ever so closely to death.
SEV00000815	She brought me back, convinced me to keep living even after the change. I... I cared about her. Goddamn, I wish I hadn't seen her.
SEV00000816	It's as if I accidently opened the page on an old book I'd closed long ago... looked right into a life I left behind. She saw right through me.
SEV00000817	I'd rather tap dance through the Divide than have to look her in the eyes again. Damn it all to hell.
SEV00000818	Who was she?
SEV00000819	No. You don't come back from this, from what I've done. I made my choices, I own it. But... maybe... can't afford to think about it.
SEV00000820	We got no time for this navel-gazing nonsense. There's a job to do, and only two of us are walking away from it.
SEV00000821	She's right. Behind all the bluster and bravado there's still good in you. I can see it.
SEV00000822	Don't I know it. What's the line? “You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.”
SEV00000823	That's goddamn right, and I plan to keep it that way.
SEV00000824	I damn sure won't be trusting you. Once an outlaw, always an outlaw.
SEV00000825	Right as ever. There's more blood to spill and a pot of gold waiting at the end of this journey. Lead on.
SEV00000826	I'll respect your privacy. In the meantime, we need to focus on the task at hand.
SEV00000827	Thick, powerful strokes. Full bodies in motion. Quivering sinews. Violence. Beauty. God. It's all there.
SEV00000828	Are you a thief or an assassin?
SEV00000829	How droll. A thief and a murderer. I suspect you didn't come here of your own volition. I'm hardly a known item. No, someone sent you.
SEV00000830	Long list of potential sponsors. The Peeps? Too cheap. Bodeen? No, you're not one of his usual toadies. Walker? No. He was broken.
SEV00000831	[He takes a moment to scan your face. His expression twists into a sardonic grin when he makes his conclusion.]
SEV00000832	It is Walker. Pure vengeance made manifest. I love it. I suspect you want to avoid trouble with Marcus. Commendable. Take me to Walker, now.
SEV00000833	Yes?
SEV00000834	These are all reprints, sadly. Why here? Why me? There is nothing of value... no, I can smell the lies from here.
SEV00000835	The question is which of my old employers wants to do away with me now? Robert is long gone, along with Richter. Not Bodeen. Too soon.
SEV00000836	This isn't about money... it's pure, cold-blooded revenge. Walker, I suspect. Justifiable. He'll be direct, brutal. I can't wait. Take me to him.
SEV00000837	<Lie> Thief.
SEV00000838	"But when a god sends harm, no man can sidestep it, no matter how strong he may be." I won't shirk a fight to the death. I welcome it.
SEV00000839	But you... you're not acting alone. Who's the puppeteer? The Booths? Dead. Richter? Dead. Gray? No, I'm too valuable. This isn't about money.
SEV00000840	Either you're a suicidal maniac... or you're helping Walker. He would do it, wouldn't he? And he'd be right. I look forward to it. Take me to him.
SEV00000841	Assassin.
SEV00000842	<Laughter>
SEV00000843	You... you are as much an art dealer as I'm president. God, I needed that. Thank you. So, you're here to kill me, I presume?
SEV00000844	Let me guess... The brothers? No. El Reloj? Too far. Dickman? Possible, but not her style. The others are dead or gone east. No, this is personal.
SEV00000845	That narrows it down. Walker. An avenging angel in the flesh. He must be impressive now, reborn in pure rage. I have to see it. Take me to him.
SEV00000846	<Lie> Neither. I'm an art dealer.
SEV00000847	Attempted assassinations are routine for me. I've ripped off barons, senators and warlords from here to Tacoma.
SEV00000848	I stole an eagle from the Legion garrison in Kingman. A frumentarius tracked me down. I plucked out his eyes and sent him back. Like Basil.
SEV00000849	Their hit squads still harass me from time to time when I'm travelling. Once butchered an entire caravan I was accompanying. Poor souls.
SEV00000850	There's also a wealth of psychopathic employers who'd love to have me erased. I can blackmail them all, of course. Very unforgiving people.
SEV00000851	You seem unsurprised that someone is here to kill you.
SEV00000852	Recovering and preserving art is my great passion, at least since I left the Master's service so long ago. I steal it if necessary.
SEV00000853	Often you can find these reprints and other antiquities adorning the musty lodge of an illiterate warlord. Even the simplest minds recognize beauty.
SEV00000854	I simply pluck them away to safety. I have a great collection in safe keeping. These are just my personal favorites from decades of... acquisition.
SEV00000855	I hope to pass this collection to the Followers or some other responsible entity after I'm gone. Beauty will save the world.
SEV00000856	How'd you manage to collect all those paintings?
SEV00000857	Ah, Peter. My closest friend. I found him as a wandering, half-starved pup after his mother perished. Oh, he was a pitiful sight then.
SEV00000858	An unruly indigent wanted to eat him. I smashed his head with a rock and let Peter feast on his brains. I believe it enhanced his cognition.
SEV00000859	He's utterly loyal and a good companion, though combat is not his forte. More of a spectator than participant. Good nose, though.
SEV00000860	What's with the coyote?
SEV00000861	I enjoy stealing things. The challenge of remaining unseen... taking what I want with none the wiser... it's indescribably gratifying.
SEV00000862	Bodeen may look the mindless thug, but he's a shrewd organizer and he pays well. He's also loyal, at least by criminal standards.
SEV00000863	He hired me for my expertise and honored the deal. Even paid a bonus. Fair man, though he could be... intemperate. Sensitive to criticism.
SEV00000864	I suspect that's why he shot Walker's wife. God, what a battle axe. Cursed the man in English and Spanish so badly that it made me blush.
SEV00000865	Some men would've ignored it... but Bodeen... well, I estimate he viewed it as an affront to his delicate ego. Childish in hindsight.
SEV00000866	Walker's entitled to kill all the robbers, of course. I'll make no excuses. I was there. That's the life we chose, with its uncaring consequences.
SEV00000867	How'd you get mixed up with Bodeen?
SEV00000868	Many of them are deceased or wandered away, reduced to myth. Take Robert, for example. Charming man, blessed with a green thumb.
SEV00000869	I worked for his organization sporadically, made a good sum. They just... collapsed one day. Rumors abound. Probably infighting.
SEV00000870	That's the thing with these criminal groups. All the furtive conspiracies and profiteering can be undone in an instant when egos collide.
SEV00000871	I hear stories, though. The strangest... is that Robert escaped the calamity and walked east, only to be enslaved. Terrible fate. I hope he's well.
SEV00000872	Who were some of the past employers you mentioned?
SEV00000873	Tonya Dickman, another member of Robert's organization. Vile harpy, that one. I'd rather gargle magma than be in a room with that witch.
SEV00000874	Gray, the mercenary. That was only one job. Hard man, but fair. No complaints. Mercenaries are overly maligned, I think.
SEV00000875	Everything else was far beyond the Mojave, and usually short-term. I've forgotten most of them, save the Master. Impossible to forget.
SEV00000876	Any other employers of note?
SEV00000877	Surely you jest. No? Very well. [He takes a deep breath in anticipation.]
SEV00000878	He was a master. Not just a master, but criminally underappreciated. Unjustly maligned due to his association with the Counter-Reformation, too.
SEV00000879	He captured the energy, the movement of life, all our passions. Lust. Hate. Raw menace pumping through muscles. Life is not still.
SEV00000880	Take The Massacre of the Innocents. Bared breasts, bloody swords. Dead Babies. Piles of dead babies. It's our beautiful, hideous reality.
SEV00000881	Yes, the world is a fine place and worth fighting for... but sometimes you have to step over dead babies. That's the lesson!
SEV00000882	I have to ask - why Rubens?
SEV00000883	After the Master's demise I was... well, lost. I wandered into a ghost town and found a pre-war bank with its vault intact. I became obsessed.
SEV00000884	It was the challenge... that's it. There's power in accessing something that's forbidden or sealed away. Many of them are time capsules.
SEV00000885	Soft hands are the key. You have to listen with your fingertips. My personal best is cracking a Gruffudder in under five minutes.
SEV00000886	How'd you get started as a safecracker?
SEV00000887	I'll continue wandering with Peter at my side, steal... er, recovering art when I find it. I'll be more selective about my employers, though.
SEV00000888	My time in Jacobstown has been brief, but I've enjoyed it immensely. I'd like to rest there in between my travels.
SEV00000889	Permit me to inquire - what will you do? Any grand schemes for a wanderer like yourself?
SEV00000890	What are you going to do after all of this?
SEV00000891	Good to see you, Walker. I'm sorry... Lee? Why? You fool, I'll have to kill you now. I rather liked you. What are you doing with Walker?
SEV00000892	Some insults have to be repaid with interest. As for being with Walker... that was not the plan. Not at all. Couldn't exactly refuse his offer.
SEV00000893	Fuck it. "All is for the best in the best of possible worlds." Right?
SEV00000894	Fuck it. "All is for the best in the best of possible worlds." Right?
SEV00000895	Indeed it is. What about you, Walker? Any grim words to offer before we begin our pas de deux... or more accurately, pas de quatre?
SEV00000896	You talk too much.
SEV00000897	Come, Peter. Battle awaits.
SEV00000898	I... I yield. I'd understand if you want to finish me off. I won't beg. I'll accept terms if you offer them, though. I can be an ally to you.
SEV00000899	More than fair. I know the way to his home up in Arrow Canyon. It can be a perilous route if you don't know the area. I can help.
SEV00000900	Terms? How about you help us take down Bodeen, for starters.
SEV00000901	Understood. I am at your mercy.
SEV00000902	I'll talk to Walker, but I make no promises.
SEV00000903	So be it. I only ask that you spare Peter. He's a good boy and wholly innocent.
SEV00000904	Time to lift the veil and see the other side.
SEV00000905	<Attack> You have to pay, Sam. Can't talk your way out of this.
SEV00000906	He was... he was still part of it. I... yeah, you're right. God knows I'm paying for my mistakes. He can pay for his, too.
SEV00000907	He's a thief, not a trigger-puller. He didn't kill anyone in Silver Springs. Give him a chance.
SEV00000908	Sorry? Sorry won't bring my wife back! He can say "Sorry" in hell for all I care!
SEV00000909	I think he's sorry for what he did.
SEV00000910	I do like the idea of travelling at night. It still doesn't sit right with me, but I'll trust your judgment. You've done right by me so far.
SEV00000911	Sam and I work well in the dark. With the two of us scouting we could move better at night.
SEV00000912	You're the guide, so I'll trust your judgment. You're responsible for him, though. He sneaks off or double-crosses us.. you're paying for it.
SEV00000913	Lee mentioned that Bodeen is in Arrow Canyon. I don't know that area. We should bring Sam.
SEV00000914	A stealthy brahmin... of all the dumbass reasons... you know what? Fine. He's your responsibility. He fucks up, it's on you.
SEV00000915	I know all about the difficulties of long trips. He'd be like a stealthy pack brahmin.
SEV00000916	Grim work, but it's gotta be done.
SEV00000917	<Attack Sam> Very well, let's get this over with.
SEV00000918	All right, Sam. You'll guide us to Bodeen and help us kill him. Do all that, keep your word... and you're free. You owe this courier your life.
SEV00000919	Thank you, Walker. I give you my word. You're a good man. For what it's worth, I'm sorry about what happened to Jessica. Wasn't right.
SEV00000920	Don't you say her fucking name. Not ever. You're on thin ice, mutant. Don't push it.
SEV00000921	Sam, I know you're a Francophone, so let me put it to you in the language of King Louis: shut the fuck up... at least until Bodeen is dead.
SEV00000922	Je comprends. Merci.
SEV00000923	He's lurking around here somewhere. Probably picking cactus fruit. Wait, here he comes.
SEV00000924	Have you seen Sam?
SEV00000925	The three of us should be able to handle Bodeen. After... well, Walker is just a bit too much for me alone. However... the two of us could manage.
SEV00000926	We'll square up with him once Bodeen is dead. No guarantees, but it's worth the risk. We'll split the entire haul, fifty-fifty. How about it?
SEV00000927	What did you have in mind?
SEV00000928	Fine. Nobility is a nice luxury to have when your pockets are full.
SEV00000929	I want no part in whatever you're planning.
SEV00000930	I figured as much. Little shit-stirring snake, that's what he is. I wish he would try it. Wipe that smarmy grin right off his rotten face.
SEV00000931	Keep up the act with him. Hell, boost his confidence. When he throws down... the two of us will make short work of him.
SEV00000932	You should know that Lee is planning to kill you once Bodeen is dead.
SEV00000933	You do that. You should also think about the blood and sweat you're spilling for this man. Five percent is not enough. Not by a long shot.
SEV00000934	Besides, he's got a deathwish. He's saving the last bullet for himself once he returns that money. Let's put him out of his misery. Think on it.
SEV00000935	I'll think about it.
SEV00000936	I knew you still had some brains knocking around up there. This is a good deal for all of us, including Walker. Man needs to be put to rest.
SEV00000937	You'll know when the time comes. Of course... Bodeen could kill us all, so what the hell. At least we have a plan, though.
SEV00000938	Fifty-fifty split? Count me in.
SEV00000939	I'm drinking in the wild air, friend. I'm intoxicated by nature, truly. So long as it's not devilishly hot, I enjoy my time outdoors.
SEV00000940	It's a lot of caps... could live the quiet life for a few decades. Been stuck in this loop of chems, debt and outlaw shit for a long time.
SEV00000941	What do you think? Any chance that an old crook like me could get a clean slate?
SEV00000942	How are you holding up?
SEV00000943	Yes, for once I am putting aside the snark and chicanery. We've been watching each other's backs for a while now. I... sort of trust you.
SEV00000944	So how about it? You think I can live in civilization again? Be a taxpaying, do-good citizen?
SEV00000945	Are you pulling my leg or really asking for my opinion?
SEV00000946	We move at dawn. Reminds me of an operation I pulled outside Topaz Lake. We pushed out those raider scum with extreme prejudice.
SEV00000947	I'm not sure how much action you've seen, but it should be a serious fight. Bodeen's probably managed to build up a small army by this point.
SEV00000948	We'll move in quickly, clear the buildings one by one. He'll make his presence known soon enough. I reckon he'll have family with him.
SEV00000949	What happens now?
SEV00000950	Yeah, cousins and such. Scumbag family is spread all over creation. I know Juan will be here. Mean as a deathclaw, that one.
SEV00000951	Ramon will be the one to watch for. A demon with the rifle by all accounts. If he's here... well, it'll be interesting.
SEV00000952	As for the rest, no idea. Those are the only two who are known to run with him on the regular. They're free to die with him, I suppose.
SEV00000953	Family?
SEV00000954	Alone... it would be touch and go. Been in enough fights to know that luck is a factor. It's an uncomfortable truth, but that's the way it is.
SEV00000955	With you and Lee backing me up... yes. Anything can happen, but I'd take those odds. Gonna be bloody no matter what.
SEV00000956	On the level - you think you can beat Bodeen?
SEV00000957	Yeah, I kind of sensed that about you. Some folks just got it, you know? Glad it was you that came through that door at the outpost.
SEV00000958	Good thing you brought me, then.
SEV00000959	Zip-a-dee-doo-dah zip-a-dee-a, I'm gonna be rich tomorrow-ay.
SEV00000960	That what you think? Decent chance we'll both be dead. Even if we do take out Bodeen... you're getting a slice, nothing more.
SEV00000961	You're really gonna pack up those caps and haul them all the way back to Silver Springs? That's a fool's errand and you know it.
SEV00000962	I mean... holy shit, you might as well saddle up Rocinante and call me Sancho. It's madness, Walker... pure farce.
SEV00000963	You can dress it up all you want. There's no romance or righteous justice here. We're killing a lot of people for some greasy caps. That's it.
SEV00000964	You know damn well I'm not doing this for the money. You might be... well, I suppose it's also your fragile ego.
SEV00000965	You're a lot like him... both walking grenades with no fuze, no safety. One spark and you destroy everything around you.
SEV00000966	At least Bodeen wore a charming mask. You? You're covered in death. It's all you have now, isn't it? I almost pity you.
SEV00000967	That might hurt if it came from a real criminal. You're a fraud, Lee. Bodeen saw right through you. So do I.
SEV00000968	We'll find out tomorrow, won't we? Only one thing standing between me and that money, Walker. You.
SEV00000969	I for one think this would be a fine time for a ghost story. Have you heard the tale of the talking dog?
SEV00000970	I hate it already. Fine, tell your story.
SEV00000971	Our story begins with a duster-clad adventurer who wanders from town to town assisting denizens of the wasteland. He is brave. He is noble.
SEV00000972	He happens upon a village. An ominous cloud lingers over the poorly-built shanties. The inhabitants are sickly and timid, saying nary a word.
SEV00000973	Even the children cast their eyes downward. All is silent save the shifting sheet metal and creaking wood. The adventurer is on guard.
SEV00000974	Let me guess... Goodsprings.
SEV00000975	Quiet. The adventurer nervously fondles his magnificent moustache. His hand is on his pistol, ready to draw... when a dog strolls into the square.
SEV00000976	The adventurer sighs in relief. He reaches to pet the beast, but recoils when he hears a deep, otherworldly voice say, "I have a secret."
SEV00000977	Stunned, the adventurer blurts out, "But you're a dog!" The canine calmly replies, "That's the secret. I talk."
SEV00000978	The adventurer's apprehension begins to melt away as he scans the dog. He is utterly normal, save his heterochromia.
SEV00000979	Hetero-fucking-what?
SEV00000980	Eyes are different color. Now shut up. The dog's eye's twitch with nervous energy. The adventurer begins to think he's found a new friend.
SEV00000981	He imagines the possibilities... a talking dog is a potent ally. It is at this moment that he notices the dog's gaze is fixated on his groin.
SEV00000982	The townspeople begin to crowd around the duo. They are chanting in a strange language. The dog licks his chops. The adventurer shudders.
SEV00000983	He nervously sputters out, "So, uh... what's your name?" The chanting grows louder. Thunder erupts overhead. The sky turns red.
SEV00000984	<Gulp>
SEV00000985	The dog grins and says, "Balls. You want to know why?" The adventurer's face is pallid. He is stiff with fear. Urine begins to pool around his feet.
SEV00000986	He wills his quaking lips to form the words. "W-w-why?" The dog inhales deeply. His eyes dance with excitement. The chants are now a deafening roar.
SEV00000987	"Because it's the first thing I bite," the dog says. In a flash, he rips off the adventurer's scrotum. A geyser of blood erupts.
SEV00000988	The adventurer slumps over in shock and screams in agony. The townspeople dance and scream, "Hail Satan!" The adventurer perishes.
SEV00000989	The hell hound is sated... temporarily. They say he still walks the wastes, always searching for a fresh sacrifice. Only two items will satisfy him.
SEV00000990	A knife... preferably with blood on it... or warm testicles torn from a living body. Beware of strange dogs. Beware... of Balls.
SEV00000991	The end. Good night, everyone. Sweet dreams!
SEV00000992	He wills his quaking lips to form the words. "W-w-why?" The dog inhales deeply. His eyes dance with excitement. The chants are now a deafening roar.
SEV00000993	Yeah, I try to imagine how they'll look, who they'll take after. Picture me with a grandson on my knee, telling stories on the front porch.
SEV00000994	Oh, and if you ever call me grandpa... I'll kill you.
SEV00000995	So you're a grandfather?
SEV00000996	Yeah, it is. Might as well get back to it.
SEV00000997	It's all in the past now. No point dwelling on it.
SEV00000998	She doesn't want anything to do with me, especially after what happened to Jessica. Reckon I'll stay away if that's what she wants.
SEV00000999	You ever thought about contacting her?
SEV00001000	There's more to it. She saw... the anger. Just before she ran off, she saw something that... well, something I regret every day.
SEV00001001	I, uh... well, Jessica was threatening to leave me a few years back. The hours, my inability to... turn off the anger after work.
SEV00001002	We were trying to make it work, thought we'd turned a corner. I found out Jessica had gotten pregnant... then got an abortion without me knowing.
SEV00001003	I confronted her... and she threw it right in my face, said she did it to spite me. Said she didn't want to raise a boy around me. So I hit her.
SEV00001004	Just one time, but there's no excusing it. Makes me sick to think about it. Sicker still that Hannah saw it. Now you know why she hates me.
SEV00001005	That was a long time ago. Maybe you can mend the relationship.
SEV00001006	I won't argue with you. Can't undo what I did, damn sure won't dance around it or make excuses. All I want... is to do one thing right for her.
SEV00001007	I may be a piece of shit, but I've still got a job to do. All I ask is that you help me see it through to the finish. Let's get moving.
SEV00001008	You're garbage.
SEV00001009	It wasn't good, to be honest. Not long after I was kicked out of office, then turned into a loafer. Don't know why she put up with me.
SEV00001010	I like to think she saw a better version of me than what was in front of her, maybe hoping I'd shed that skin and turn out good.
SEV00001011	That's what burns me up... that I didn't do that for her before she was killed. Best I can do is get justice for her. Let's... let's get moving.
SEV00001012	How'd you make the marriage work after that?
SEV00001013	Absolutely. Seen enough wife beaters in my day to know the excuses, the rationalizing bullshit that comes out of their mouths.
SEV00001014	I did wrong. All I can do now is try to get that woman a small slice of justice for all the hell I put her through while she was alive. Let's go.
SEV00001015	It only happened once?
SEV00001016	Pretty much. Even if we could talk, I wouldn't. I want to make sure this place stays dead when we're done with Bodeen. Let the buzzards have it.
SEV00001017	It's a moot point in the end. This isn't a town, it's an armed camp full of predators. Reckon they're keeping slaves, so... no mercy.
SEV00001018	With that said... use judgment. There are liable to be a few noncombatants running around. Don't be a maniac.
SEV00001019	So there's no chance of talking our way in there? We just go in guns blazing?
SEV00001020	I know that, but you better learn. You start gunning down slaves and such... you'll be squaring up with me long before we meet Bodeen.
SEV00001021	Discretion is not my strong suit.
SEV00001022	Same for me. Good night.
SEV00001023	I better rest up, then. Good night.
SEV00001024	I'm not sure yet. I'll be returning the bulk of the money to Silver Springs, obviously. After that? Haven't made up my mind.
SEV00001025	We've been working together for a while... so I wouldn't mind your input. Any thoughts?
SEV00001026	And what happens after all this?
SEV00001027	[SUCCEEDED] Even if I swallow my pride and make the attempt, who's to say she'd want anything to do with me? Stubborn, just like her mother.
SEV00001028	I think you should seek out your daughter and make amends. You still have a family.
SEV00001029	[FAILED] No, not happening. I know her too well. She doesn't want to see my face. I'll be lucky if she'll take money that I send her.
SEV00001030	I think you should seek out your daughter and make amends. You still have a family.
SEV00001031	Really? Badge will feel a little heavier this time around, I think. Well, I just don't know. I'll think about it.
SEV00001032	I think you should go back to being a lawman.
SEV00001033	It's been a ride. Won't lie... it's been satisfying to catch up with these men. Wouldn't mind doing it again if I manage to survive.
SEV00001034	Money ain't bad, either. The seven agencies pay well from what I hear. I could send my earnings to my daughter, make a trust for my grandkids.
SEV00001035	That... that could work. More useful than what I had planned. Thank you.
SEV00001036	You seem to have a knack for hunting down bad guys. Might try bounty hunting.
SEV00001037	Yeah, I suppose it is. Won't put that burden on anyone else. I'll handle it.
SEV00001038	It's your call.
SEV00001039	[SUCCEEDED] Jesus, I wish that conversation with Anne never happened. Dredged up old feelings... old memories I'd buried.
SEV00001040	Even if I did... it would be a slap in the face to all the... the truly good people like Anne. No, I can't.
SEV00001041	I can see myself retiring or starting over... but going back to the Followers? Never gonna happen. I won't live a lie. I need a real option.
SEV00001042	You should go back to the Followers, like Anne said. Put this behind you and help others.
SEV00001043	[FAILED] No, I'm not falling for that insipid crap. I need a real plan.
SEV00001044	Like they say at the Sierra Madre: "Begin Again."
SEV00001045	What, go east? I mean... I can pass through Caesar's territory easy enough. Just have to be... well, not a criminal. I could do that, I guess.
SEV00001046	I'd like to see Texas, though. Heard some of the other ghouls mention it in passing. Wild stories trickle in sometimes. Yeah, why not?
SEV00001047	Appreciate your input. Get some rest, friend.
SEV00001048	It's possible. I'd recommend you leave the Mojave, though.
SEV00001049	You're the voice of my gut. Too set in my ways, like an old hound dog. It has its moments, you know? Living wild in a wild place. You should try it.
SEV00001050	You've been all right to me, so let me give you a fair warning... as a friend... don't get between me and those caps. I need them.
SEV00001051	Now it's time to dance with Morpheus and forget all these troubles for a brief moment. Good night.
SEV00001052	You wanted to live free, right? Stick the life you know and stop second-guessing yourself.
SEV00001053	[SUCCEEDED] I... I... maybe. I need to sleep on this. Yeah. Thank you... for everything. Didn't expect this from a fellow wanderer. Life is funny.
SEV00001054	Let's all get some rest. All this banter is for naught if we die tomorrow, anyway. Good night.
SEV00001055	Every saint starts as a sinner. I believe you can be a good man again, Lee.
SEV00001056	[FAILED] Uh, yes it is. Are you damaged in the head or something? C'mon, give me a real option here.
SEV00001057	It's not a lie if you believe it.
SEV00001058	Educate the mind and the heart, huh? "Kids, don't be a murdering shitbag." Something like that? Might prevent another Edward Sallow.
SEV00001059	Maybe. I need to sleep on this. You need to sleep, too. All this speculation will be for naught if we die. Good night.
SEV00001060	With your experience you can impart knowledge and wisdom. That's a rare gift. Don't waste it.
SEV00001061	Lord, this is gonna be rough. Assuming we do make it through tomorrow... I... yeah, I'll do it. I'll look her in the eyes and apologize.
SEV00001062	Eating a bullet sounds better than that... but I'll do it. God as my witness, I'll do it. Now let's get some sleep and pray we survive.
SEV00001063	You won't know for sure until you meet her in person. Never give up on your family.
SEV00001064	Ain't that simple and you know it. No, sending her money will be enough.
SEV00001065	Just tell her you're really sorry.
SEV00001066	Well, when you put it like that... sound like my old grandpappy. Might not have been a walking thesaurus like Lee, but he had a way with words.
SEV00001067	I'll do it. No more whining or excuses. I'll look her right in the eyes and tell her I'm wrong. Then I'll know.
SEV00001068	A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
SEV00001069	Damn, straight at me... okay, fair enough. So it's a question of nerves? I know what it's like to fail... I don't want to feel that again.
SEV00001070	You've got enough nerves to handle yourself in a shootout. Surely you can talk to your daughter.
SEV00001071	And what a battle it will be. I'd like to see it depicted with oil on canvas, in the style of... The Death of Decius Mus. Very appropriate.
SEV00001072	May fortune favor you in your endeavors. I for one believe you will stop the barbarian horde. Ils ne passeront pas!
SEV00001073	I'll probably wander from job to job until things kick off at Hoover Dam.
SEV00001074	Fortuitous that you should mention that... rumor has it that William Gray may be opening a new branch in town. If so, do look him up.
SEV00001075	I wouldn't be surprised if House had a hand in his move to Vegas. War is profitable. War on behalf of Robert House would be very profitable.
SEV00001076	So many opportunities. Hope you sleep well. We may all be knocking on heaven's door tomorrow. Good night.
SEV00001077	I'm thinking of working as a mercenary for a spell.
SEV00001078	Now there's a business that won't ever go out of style. Agencies are flourishing these days. Lots of bounties up in the basin.
SEV00001079	Just be careful when you get up in the wild places. Stay away from Mount Irish, whatever you do. Bad mojo, as they say. Very bad.
SEV00001080	However, if you're in need of an Enkidu to assist your Gilgamesh, I'm more than happy to help take on the monsters of our world.
SEV00001081	Might even recover some art while we're at it. Anything is possible on the open road. Now... now it is time to rest my weary bones.
SEV00001082	Bounty hunting is always an option.
SEV00001083	A veritable vacquero, that's what you are. Keep your powder dry, then. I sense grim tidings... dark days may be ahead. Stay sharp.
SEV00001084	Oh, and if we should survive this bloody fracas, do look me up in Jacobstown. I can be an extra hand on your great cattle drive through the Mojave.
SEV00001085	Us cowpokes, we take it as it comes.
SEV00001086	Thank you, you as well.
SEV00001087	Good night to you and Peter. Hope you both sleep well.
SEV00001088	There is evil... and there is evil. Whatever is stirring in those mountains is the latter. It's malignant in essence, not just some passing devilry.
SEV00001089	I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Brotherhood ships on fire off Rushmore. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Gateway...
SEV00001090	All these images are nothing compared what I've heard about Mount Irish. Blood sacrifices... ancient rituals... a Red Prince on a throne.
SEV00001091	Avoid it at all costs... or if the opportunity arises, use a nuclear warhead. Give it the Old Testament treatment. That would do nicely.
SEV00001092	Anyway, lots to think about. Good night.
SEV00001093	What's the deal with Mount Irish?
SEV00001094	Well, Walker... you got me. See why you didn't start shooting off the bat. Wanted your gun-hand to back you up. Well played.
SEV00001095	Was it really worth it? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm impressed... but all that killing... just to get me?
SEV00001096	To look you in the eyes... to tell you I'm gonna kill you? Goddamn right it was worth it. I'd kill every man in this valley twice for that chance.
SEV00001097	Bodeen, you and Walker should take a trip together. You both love misery and killing everything around you.
SEV00001098	Lee, whatever happens here... you're getting the first bullet, you rat fuck.
SEV00001099	Walker... I'm not keen on all this talking. You want speeches, go chat with the Booth boys. Pull that Roscoe when the mood hits you. I'm game.
SEV00001100	Lee, whatever happens here... you're getting the first bullet, you rat fuck. Sam, you're second. Should've stayed away.
SEV00001101	Walker... I'm not keen on all this talking. You want speeches, go chat with the Booth boys. Pull that Roscoe when the mood hits you. I'm game.
SEV00001102	Let's dance.
SEV00001103	And you... what's your part in this? Why in the fiddler's fuck would you help Walker with this suicide mission?
SEV00001104	Yeah, I'm a little fucking dyspeptic after you destroyed everything I worked so hard to build. You could say I'm in a mood.
SEV00001105	You know how hard it was to get this place up and running? My mentor, Roy... the sacrifices he made... you got no idea.
SEV00001106	Think we're bad? Should've seen the crew that was here before us. Roy buried them. Then came the goddamn Dog Pecker Flies!
SEV00001107	A swarm straight from the pits of hell... and Roy beat them. We were on the verge of greatness... and you just shit on our world. Upset? Yeah.
SEV00001108	You seem upset.
SEV00001109	Caps? You did it for the caps? Lord knows that Walker isn't giving you much. Different circumstances I might make a counter-offer.
SEV00001110	But after what you pulled... the men you killed... they were loyal to me. I took care of them, cared about them. Even the Cram guy.
SEV00001111	You killed them like they were dumb animals. Reap what you sow, cocksucker.
SEV00001112	I'm in it for the caps.
SEV00001113	I earned it. Took a slug from Ranger McCall before I ripped it off his corpse. Toughest bastard I ever fought. Tougher than any of you, anyway.
SEV00001114	Much as I appreciate the compliment, I'd like to stick to the point - what the hell are you doing here?
SEV00001115	Nice outfit. Where'd you get it?
SEV00001116	You're gonna have to earn it, boy.
SEV00001117	You don't rate that armor. I'm taking it back.
SEV00001118	You're gonna have to earn it, bitch.
SEV00001119	You don't rate that armor. I'm taking it back.
SEV00001120	See, Ramon... that's the kind of honesty I can respect. Damn shame how this has to go down. I could've used someone like you.
SEV00001121	No point putting it off any more. Let's find out who got right with Jesus this morning.
SEV00001122	I was bored.
SEV00001123	That's all you got? I'm right and you're wrong? Know how many kill-crazy maniacs have thrown that at me? You really believe it. Hell fire.
SEV00001124	Highfalutin little fuck-nugget... preaching at me while you're killing half of creation. I mean... look around you! You're the grim reaper!
SEV00001125	Good chance most of us are about to meet our maker here in a moment, so let me ask one last question - you got any remorse?
SEV00001126	It was the right thing to do.
SEV00001127	Not yet.
SEV00001128	You got no right to throw that at me. You're a raider. A slaver. A murderer. It ends now.
SEV00001129	A wise choice, friend. Think fast!
SEV00001130	Well, you can't blame me for trying. Now... let's see if you can catch lightning.
SEV00001131	No thanks.
SEV00001132	They weren't angels, but great things aren't built by moral men. We made the hard choices, laid the foundation for something better.
SEV00001133	I can say it now... I regret killing Walker's wife. Happened in a flash. Woman told me... well, it was bad. Couldn't lose face, you know?
SEV00001134	Figure I'll pay for it at some point. Maybe it's today. Walker ain't the first to come after me, though. I'll take my chances.
SEV00001135	I have plenty of regrets, but cleaning out this canyon isn't one of them.
SEV00001136	Well ain't you something. Ice cold to the core. Let's see if you flinch.
SEV00001137	No.
SEV00001138	You're gonna feel regret when I nail your skin to the walls, motherfucker.
SEV00001139	My only regret is not killing you before you had a chance to speak.
SEV00001140	Nothing like that click, is there? So satisfying. Bodeen proposed using a thermal lance at the Silver Springs bank. I refused.
SEV00001141	You know... I'm something of a safecracker myself.
SEV00001142	It's done, Lee. Take your share and go home.
SEV00001143	They say revenge is the sweetest morsel cooked in hell. A bag of stolen money is a close second in my book.
SEV00001144	Lee... you did your part. Take your share and walk while you can. I'm losing my patience.
SEV00001145	That! That's why I won't go. "Losing my patience." Like you're the noble father figure of the wastes. You're a bully, Walker. Same as Bodeen.
SEV00001146	Don't you... don't you say that again. This is your last warning, Lee.
SEV00001147	You're alone for a reason. You'll always be alone. I'm ready when you are, sheriff.
SEV00001148	<Whistling.>
SEV00001149	[SUCCEEDED] Yes... yes, it is. All right, my fellow masochist... let's hear it.
SEV00001150	I've been with you every step of this journey. That's worth something, isn't it?
SEV00001151	[FAILED] Oh, you want chivalry? Fine, we'll handle it like Hamilton and Burr!
SEV00001152	Can't you two work this out like gentlemen?
SEV00001153	Hell yes! You ready to back me up?
SEV00001154	Remember your plan to split the caps?
SEV00001155	Good. No hesitation!
SEV00001156	<Attack Walker.> I'm in. Let's do this.
SEV00001157	You fucking snake. "Go thou, and fill another room in hell!"
SEV00001158	<Attack> You overplayed your hand, Lee. Can't let you do this.
SEV00001159	Oh, it's about to be final. You hear that, Walker? Fine. Spit it out, quickly.
SEV00001160	Easy, let's talk this out before things get... final.
SEV00001161	Oh, the master of rhetoric makes an appeal to reason! Well, out with it!
SEV00001162	Calm the fuck down and listen to me unless you want to end up dead.
SEV00001163	Damn... there's pulling out the big guns... and then there's pulling out the nuclear howitzer and aiming it right at my face. Fuck me.
SEV00001164	Fine... off into the sunset I go. Walker... from the bottom of my heart, I hope to never see you again.
SEV00001165	And as for you... thank you. Doubt I'll see you again, but who knows. Got a feeling your life is about to be a lot more interesting than mine.
SEV00001166	And you know what? I'm okay with that. Farewell and safe travels.
SEV00001167	Remember what Anne told you - there's still a place for you in the Followers.
SEV00001168	[SUCCEEDED] Damn it! Yeah... you're right. Play it cool, play it smart. Got greedy with Bodeen and look what happened. Yeah, time to cash out.
SEV00001169	Fine... off into the sunset I go. Walker... from the bottom of my heart, I hope to never see you again.
SEV00001170	And as for you... thank you. Doubt I'll see you again, but who knows. Got a feeling your life is about to be a lot more interesting than mine.
SEV00001171	And you know what? I'm okay with that. Farewell and safe travels.
SEV00001172	You're a survivor. Taking crazy risks isn't how you've made it this far. Play the long game.
SEV00001173	[FAILED] Your conscious is just a moral lookout, not a guide. Yeah, I've heard enough.
SEV00001174	Let your conscience be your guide!
SEV00001175	Never tell me the odds.
SEV00001176	Math was not my strong suit... clearly. You're right. Put so much into getting those caps I didn't want to fold.
SEV00001177	You're right. I'll take my share and make new opportunities in a more... civilized place.
SEV00001178	I know I'm normally the loquacious sort, but... I think it's best if I just left now. Good luck to you, friend.
SEV00001179	The possibility of surviving this shootout is approximately 3,720 to 1.
SEV00001180	What? Here at the moment of decision and you want to quibble? We're talking about a killing, not haggling over fucking fruit!
SEV00001181	I think it would be a mistake. Hear me out for a moment.
SEV00001182	Just had to take a sledgehammer straight to my ego, huh? I mean... I wasn't planning on dying, but I get your point.
SEV00001183	You can argue that pride isn't worth it. Fine. But caps? There's a price for everyone... and this is mine.
SEV00001184	Walker is better and you know it. I never took you as someone who'd die for pride.
SEV00001185	No, not really.
SEV00001186	Aren't you tired of shooting people?
SEV00001187	I regret telling you that... part of a life that's long gone. But yes... I still respect the Followers, and that carries weight. Say your piece.
SEV00001188	[Followers of the Apocalypse] You're a learned man, Lee. You know this is wrong.
SEV00001189	Of all the people... and to do it like this... goddamn you. Goddamn you. Hope you like spending these caps in hell, you rat fuck.
SEV00001190	<Attack.> I didn't come here for a slice. I want the whole pie.
SEV00001191	[He reciprocates with a firm handshake.]
SEV00001192	Goodbye, friend. Safe travels.
SEV00001193	<Shake his hand.> Goodbye, Walker.
SEV00001194	Never change. See you down the line.
SEV00001195	Glad this shit is over. Just pay me and be on your way.
SEV00001196	That... that's the gun that killed my wife. No, I never want to touch it. I'd like to think it will be a force for good in your hands.
SEV00001197	I have a strong feeling that you're going to be putting it to a lot of use soon. Just be faster than Bodeen and you'll be all right.
SEV00001198	Hope to see you again in a time and place where we don't have to pack pistols. Goodbye.
SEV00001199	[Uncaring Consequences] I picked up Bodeen's pistol. Hope you don't mind if I keep it.
SEV00001200	Our mustachioed nemesis lies defeated and the aim of your quest will soon be in hand. I have honored my end of the arrangement.
SEV00001201	Unless you object, I will make my exit. I sense that today's carnage may not be at an end, and I want no further involvement.
SEV00001202	North. Before our... encounter... I heard whispers that the mad warlord Requin is hoarding precious art in his squalid stick-fort.
SEV00001203	He must be... relieved of these antiquities. It's a matter of good taste. My course is charted, I must follow it.
SEV00001204	After that... back to the Mojave. Seek me out at my cabin. Perhaps we can conduct a joint rescue of the arts.
SEV00001205	Where will you go?
SEV00001206	We're all the wrong people. Some are just more wrong than others. None is more wrong than that sadistic madman. Oh, and steal? Dirty word.
SEV00001207	No, I'm nothing if not cautious. Remember... I served in the Master's Army. These trifling dirt kings of the Basin are a parody of real rulers.
SEV00001208	I'd like that. Just be careful you don't steal from the wrong people.
SEV00001209	No, no. It was a matter of honor, not caps. I've stolen enough caps to last me ten human lifetimes. But a Rubens? I'd hug you to death. Literally.
SEV00001210	It would please me if you took that sum and donated it to the Followers. Most factions are rife with vicious machinations, but not them.
SEV00001211	Sure, they produce an oddball dictator every now and then, but nobody's perfect. Help them in my name, please.
SEV00001212	<Pay him 200 caps.> Thank you, Sam. Here's something for your trouble.
SEV00001213	And you as well. Great trials await you, young hero. Just remember to stop and enjoy the beauty of this world between the bursts of carnage.
SEV00001214	Do not rage, do not regret. Stay in the present, and do as the writer instructed: "Live to the point of tears." Adieu!
SEV00001215	Goodbye, Sam. Stay safe.
SEV00001216	I'll consider that an amicable jab born out of mutual respect. I wish you good fortune in the coming struggles... I fear they will be plentiful.
SEV00001217	Beat it, mutant.
SEV00001218	Fair question. I despise half-measures, bargains or settlements in their many forms. It's a reminder of the indignities I swallowed in my old life.
SEV00001219	My former wife humiliated me... carped and nagged... belittled... it took this transformation to shake me from my stupor.
SEV00001220	Never again. The spoils go to the victor, and I've won. Walker is dead and I'm not. I have no quarrel with you... not yet.
SEV00001221	Why are you doing this?
SEV00001222	No, I'm an academic!
SEV00001223	The first thing I'm cutting off is your lying tongue. Then I start between your legs.
SEV00001224	A wise choice. This concludes our business. If I see you again... well, I'll assume the worst and start shooting. You understand. Farewell.
SEV00001225	<Give him the caps.> I'm not going to fight you over caps, Lee.
SEV00001226	Oh, I will.
SEV00001227	<Attack.> You want the caps? Come and take them.
SEV00001228	Thanks to the Courier's involvement, the journey to avenge Walker's wife and recover the stolen caps was concluded.
SEV00001229	Before leaving Arrow Canyon, the Courier paused to reflect on the events that had unfolded... and pondered the consequences of his actions.
SEV00001230	Thanks to the Courier's involvement, the journey to avenge Walker's wife and recover the stolen caps was concluded.
SEV00001231	Before leaving Arrow Canyon, the Courier paused to reflect on the events that had unfolded... and pondered the consequences of her actions.
SEV00001232	During the walk back to the Mojave, the Courier took satisfaction in his accomplishments, but also believed that his greatest struggles lay ahead.
SEV00001233	And with that, the Courier walked out of Arrow Canyon and back to the Mojave Wasteland, where new challenges awaited him.
SEV00001234	During the walk back to the Mojave, the Courier took satisfaction in her accomplishments, but also believed that her greatest struggles lay ahead.
SEV00001235	And with that, the Courier walked out of Arrow Canyon and back to the Mojave Wasteland, where new challenges awaited her.
SEV00001236	Though many considered Jed's death justified, his wife's demise was widely considered to be an act of cold-blooded murder.
SEV00001237	Accounts of Bethany's death would soon reach her family, the Vegas. Rumors swirled that a large posse was forming to avenge her death.
SEV00001238	Grateful for Walker's mercy, Jed and Bethany Phillips would leave the Mojave Wasteland and establish a small farm outside Prescott, Arizona.
SEV00001239	While their homestead initially thrived due to the peace and security provided by the Legion, Jed's good fortune soon ended.
SEV00001240	When the local centurion demanded a number of their herd, Jed loudly scoffed at what he considered to be an unfair offer by the official.
SEV00001241	Jed was summarily crucified and his entire family enslaved.
SEV00001242	Ronaldo eagerly resumed his illicit activities in Freeside. He would ruthlessly employ violence and intimidation to expand his criminal empire.
SEV00001243	In time, Ronaldo would corner a sizeable portion of the Freeside chem trade. However, his brutality would spur his enemies to conspire against him.
SEV00001244	In a dramatic twist, Ronaldo's subordinates would turn on him en masse and kill him in the very manner he so often utilized - by stabbing.
SEV00001245	Taking the Courier's advice to heart, Ronaldo soon departed New Vegas and took up the bounty hunter trade.
SEV00001246	His expertise with edged weapons would soon earn him the moniker of "The Knife". Unsurprisingly, Ronaldo rarely brought back his targets alive.
SEV00001247	Eventually, Ronaldo drifted north into the Great Basin and was never seen again.
SEV00001248	Ronaldo reluctantly joined the Followers of the Apocalypse. While initially a lackluster pupil, he hit his stride when he discovered medicine.
SEV00001249	With an unquenchable thirst for knowledge about anatomy and a zeal for dissection, Ronaldo would eventually find his place as a surgeon.
SEV00001250	Short on empathy and long on expertise, he would go on to distinguish himself as the premiere trauma surgeon in the Followers.
SEV00001251	Rats and feral children would soon descend upon Jimmy's corpse and pick it clean. His rancid flesh would sate the appetites of countless children.
SEV00001252	However, Jimmy's body was an unholy reservoir of chems and moonshine. Any man or beast that consumed his flesh was soon gripped by madness.
SEV00001253	Soon thereafter the Followers would begin treating an outbreak of endless babbling they dubbed, "The Jimmies."
SEV00001254	Jimmy continued raving at anyone within earshot until the Kings finally ejected him from Freeside. He then argued with himself outside the gate.
SEV00001255	Soon thereafter, Jimmy vanished. His disappearance coincided with sightings of strange lights north of town. His exact fate remains unknown.
SEV00001256	Though Sam's time at Jacobstown had been brief, he had already developed strong bonds of friendship with his fellow supermutants.
SEV00001257	After burying his remains, they would mourn his passing with a small service, with the eulogy delivered in French. Several observers wept.
SEV00001258	Sam and Peter merrily bounded across the high deserts of the Great Basin, stealthily "recovering" artifacts and antiquities at multiple sites.
SEV00001259	During his travels, Sam was pleased to hear of the Courier's new adventures. He smiled at accounts of strange companions and distant journeys.
SEV00001260	Wars in the Sonoran desert, raids into Arizona, grand battles to defend towns, flying saucers... all these rumors piqued his interest.
SEV00001261	Unsure what could be fact or exaggeration, he only hoped that the Courier remained safe, happy and grounded in a code of honor.
SEV00001262	Not long after, Sam and Peter were last seen crossing into the territory of Requin, the most feared warlord of the Great Basin.
SEV00001263	With his head held low, Lee would quietly re-enter service in the Followers of the Apocalypse. However, he would soon find fulfillment as a teacher.
SEV00001264	Working side-by-side with Anne, Lee would come to relish his role as a professor of Classics. In time, his wanderlust and greed would fade.
SEV00001265	For the first time in his life, Lee found himself truly happy. He hoped to see the Courier again, if only to extend his heartfelt thanks.
SEV00001266	When he heard the stories of the Courier's travels and travails, he was jealous for a fleeting moment, then locked eyes with Anne.
SEV00001267	Lee would smile and put the thoughts aside. He had found love and purpose, and that was enough.
SEV00001268	Taking the Courier's advice to heart, Lee turned east after departing Arrow Canyon. He had made up his mind to reach a strange, unknown land: Texas.
SEV00001269	During his trip through Legion territory, Lee chuckled at the stories of the Courier's exploits that trickled through the caravan lines.
SEV00001270	He was last seen crossing out of Legion territory somewhere near Cloudcroft. Caravaneers claimed he was headed for Fort Davis, Texas.
SEV00001271	With a pocketful of caps and newfound pride from his recent victory, Lee set out for the Great Basin, determined to make his mark as an outlaw.
SEV00001272	He soon assembled a motley assortment of rogues and hired guns to assist him in his efforts. He was on the verge of becoming a true warlord.
SEV00001273	However, he soon ran afoul of El Reloj in a territorial dispute. In what was supposed to be a peaceful parley, Lee insulted the veteran bandito.
SEV00001274	Before Lee could touch his pistol, El Reloj drew and shot him between the eyes. His body would be unceremoniously dumped in a ditch and burned.
SEV00001275	Lee would die forgotten, outside a handful of Followers who remembered him in his former life.
SEV00001276	In time, his bloated corpse would serve as fodder for the burgeoning swarm of insects inside Arrow Canyon.
SEV00001277	Word of Walker's death would eventually reach his estranged daughter. Though conflicted, she acknowledged his effort to avenge her mother.
SEV00001278	She would hold a small memorial service for Walker, then erect a tombstone next to her mother's grave.
SEV00001279	Walker would make the long trek back to Silver Springs, carefully safeguarding the bank haul every step of the way.
SEV00001280	Many of the townspeople were stunned at his appearance; they were positively shocked at the return of most of the stolen caps.
SEV00001281	Several of the town leaders extended an opportunity for Walker to return as acting sheriff, but he politely refused.
SEV00001282	Instead, he strolled over to his wife's grave, drew his pistol and shot himself. He would be buried with full honors beside her.
SEV00001283	Instead, Walker began serving as sheriff in the remote mining town of Rochester. There he upheld the law without succumbing to anger.
SEV00001284	The townspeople would grow to admire their sheriff and dismiss stories of his past brutality. Raiders would still avoid the town, however.
SEV00001285	Instead, he headed south and took up the bounty hunting trade. He would pride himself on bringing most of his marks in alive.
SEV00001286	Some time later he went south in search of the mutant Ares, reputed to be active in the Altar Desert. Walker was never seen again.
SEV00001287	Instead, Walker sought out his estranged daughter. When he knocked, his grandson would answer the door, prompting Walker to break down in tears.
SEV00001288	He would soon reconcile with his daughter and live out his days as a bailiff, content to mentor his grandson and keep his family safe.
SEV00001289	Depopulated and dilapidated, Arrow Canyon was soon visited by another predatory swarm of Dog Pecker Flies.
SEV00001290	Without the strong leadership of Bodeen or Roy Bee to oppose them, the rapacious insects set about infesting every corner of the canyon at will.
SEV00001291	The flies would flourish in the canyon, and periodically great swarms would spring forth and terrorize neighboring towns and highways.
SEV00001292	In time, travellers would refer to the site as "Dog Pecker Canyon" out of recognition for the insects' mastery of the location.
SEV00001293	Then that wraps up this grand misadventure. Too bad for Walker, but good for us, right? Don't spend your half too quickly.
SEV00001294	I... will be out of sight and out of mind. Lot of dead bodies in your future, if I were a betting man. Pardon me if I keep my distance.
SEV00001295	Good luck out there.
SEV00001296	That works for me.
SEV00001297	You rat fuck. All right... see if you can.
SEV00001298	<Attack.> Wrong. I'm taking it all.
SEV00001299	Oh, a David! I remember selling this to him. Well, he won't be needing it now.
SEV00001300	Oh, I know this director! A real pioneer in the "Singing, homicidal cowboy" style. Lots of fatalities on set. Filmmaking is a dangerous business.
SEV00001301	Now that's a leader I'd follow to the ends of the earth.
SEV00001302	I find that forgiving yourself for your own mistakes is the hardest act in life.
SEV00001303	A short film, so I hear. A simple delivery job.
SEV00001304	There's nothing more repugnant than a fence-sitter. We all have to pick sides at some point.
SEV00001305	If war is hell then war in the desert is a special hell.
SEV00001306	Ha! So that's what the Enclave thinks of us! "Yes, humans, we carry bayonets stained with infant blood. We will eat your babies!"
SEV00001307	It saddens me to think America's legacy is reduced to the Enclave. All the trappings and symbols but none of the dignity or freedom.
SEV00001308	They just need better leadership... like George Washington. I had the pleasure of speaking with him once in Utah. Never met a nobler hound.
SEV00001309	Delivery.
SEV00001310	Thought you could get away with it, didn't you? Killing my sister in cold blood. Bethany didn't deserve that. She was the best of us.
SEV00001311	I never approved of her running off with that dipshit, but he made her happy. Good enough for me. You had no right.
SEV00001312	I didn't survive three tours to have my kid sister gunned down like a rat by some wandering, fuckboot mailman. Die in fear and pain, cocksucker.
SEV00001313	Cocksure and steadfast, I like it. Yeah, it was right. Wasn't necessarily clean, but we settled it.
SEV00001314	Seen a lot of evil men get away with it, live out lives in peace and abundance... I'd like to think we pushed the scales back towards justice.
SEV00001315	Absolutely.
SEV00001316	It always comes down to that, doesn't it? I didn't expect to survive, honestly. Still... well, still dealing with it. Strange feeling.
SEV00001317	I'm glad it's done, but I don't revel in it. No celebration. Just... did our duty. Wish it could've been cleaner, but it's an imperfect world.
SEV00001318	It was him or us.
SEV00001319	Any one of them would've faced a trial in NCR. I guess that's what gives me pause... knowing we bypassed due process and the rest of it.
SEV00001320	I'm glad it's done, but I don't revel in it. No celebration. Just... did our duty. Wish it could've been cleaner, but it's an imperfect world.
SEV00001321	It's a little late for second thoughts since we just wiped out the entire town.
SEV00001322	Yep. Make a decision and stick with it, see it through to the brutal finish. We settled the score. Now we just got to live with it.
SEV00001323	A man oughta do what he thinks is best.
SEV00001324	We'll get you taken care of. Just stand still...
SEV00001325	<Pay 50 caps.> Patch me up, doc.
SEV00001326	Of course. How can I help you?
SEV00001327	I need medical treatment.
SEV00001328	Here's what I have.
SEV00001329	I'd like to buy some medical supplies.
SEV00001330	Here's what I have. Full discount, of course.
SEV00001331	I'd like to buy some medical supplies.
SEV00001332	It happens to the best of us. Just one moment and I'll get you cleaned up.
SEV00001333	<Pay 50 caps> I'd like for you to cure my addiction, please.
SEV00001334	I know the nausea is awful. We'll take care of that in a jiffy.
SEV00001335	<Pay 50 caps> Can you take care of my radiation poisoning?
SEV00001336	Sam... he's gone? That breaks my heart. I... I knew him in Reno. Good soul. A thief, yes... but had a pure heart in his chest.
SEV00001337	We had some lean years up there in Reno, but we could always count on Sam to help see us through the tough times. Oh, that breaks my heart.
SEV00001338	Oh, you mentioned a will... what did he leave?
SEV00001339	I wanted to let you know that Sam died. He left you some things in his will.
SEV00001340	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm easily distracted. It's just west of the Thorn. Should be open in less than a week. Please come visit.
SEV00001341	Where exactly are you building the clinic?
SEV00001342	Just got here from Reno. Wanted a change of scenery. This place has its challenges, but I think we can make a difference once the funding picks up.
SEV00001343	I haven't seen you here before. What brings you to New Vegas?
SEV00001344	It's just rotten. Crime is rampant, corruption everywhere. Even seeps into the Followers sometimes. I couldn't stand it.
SEV00001345	Got tired of losing friends and patients out in the Great Basin, too. It's a wilderness... just devours people, even the strong ones.
SEV00001346	People are hopelessly naive about settling in wild places like that. Everything is against you... raiders, wild animals... even the weather.
SEV00001347	But it's the brutality more than anything... even the good people go bad when they get hungry. Yeah, I'm glad I left.
SEV00001348	Why'd you want to leave Reno?
SEV00001349	Oh, okay.
SEV00001350	Nevermind, let's talk about something else.
SEV00001351	This... this is incredible! God bless you, Sam. I promise you it will be put to good use. We'll begin construction immediately!
SEV00001352	Was there anything else?
SEV00001353	<Give 5,000 caps> Sam wanted the Followers to have this. It's his life savings.
SEV00001354	This was one of Sam's favorites. A Rubens, of course. Never hurts to have the goddess of health on our side.
SEV00001355	Thank you for doing this. I know Sam thanks you, too. I hope to see you at the new clinic!
SEV00001356	<Give painting> He also wanted you to have this painting.
SEV00001357	Okay, that does it. We have the funding to finally get some real medical care in Westside. Thank you for doing this. I'm sure Sam thanks you, too.
SEV00001358	<Lie> No, that's everything.
SEV00001359	Then lay on, wretch.
SEV00001360	<Attack> I'm not here for conversation. Shall we?
SEV00001361	"Because it's the first thing I bite," the dog says. In a flash, he rips off the adventurer's scrotum. A geyser of blood erupts.
SEV00001362	The adventurer slumps over in shock and screams in agony. The townspeople dance and scream, "Hail Satan!" The adventurer perishes.
SEV00001363	The hell hound is sated... temporarily. They say he still walks the wastes, always searching for a fresh sacrifice. Only two items will satisfy him.
SEV00001364	A knife... preferably with blood on it... or warm testicles torn from a living body. Beware of strange dogs. Beware... of Balls.
SEV00001365	The end. Good night, everyone. Sweet dreams!
SEV00001366	I was hoping for something simple like The Golden Arm, but you had to conjure up images of Satan in canine form. Wait, what was that?
SEV00001367	It's frightening Peter. He suffers from anxiety... I don't want to exacerbate his condition. Besides, it's a grisly tale, not fit for the young.
SEV00001368	Why didn't you finish your story?
SEV00001369	Oh, all right. I'll try not to butcher the conclusion. Nothing worse than a lackluster final act.
SEV00001370	I think we'd all like to hear the ending.
SEV00001371	Oh, then I'll trust you. Stay strong, Peter. The world is full of horrors and you must learn to face them!
SEV00001372	A story like this could help Peter develop resiliency.
SEV00001373	At once!
SEV00001374	Fear can be instructive. Finish the story.
SEV00001375	I see. Yes, I'll finish the puppy story for you. Listen closely!
SEV00001376	Want puppy story!
SEV00001377	<Fearful Whimper>
SEV00001378	<Fearful Whimper>
SEV00001379	<Fearful Whimper>
SEV00001380	On behalf of Peter, thank you. Sleep well.
SEV00001381	You're right. We'll finish the story another time.

SEV00001466	After waiting quietly for several hours, you notice a group of Powder Gangers creeping towards the ambush site.
SEV00001467	"Roy Bee, Founder."
SEV00001468	Lee collects his share and quietly strolls toward the exit of Arrow Canyon. Near the canyon's end he turns around and delivers a half-hearted wave. Soon after he disappears into the shadowy narrows of a gorge. It is uncertain if your paths will cross again in the future.
SEV00001469	Farewell
SEV00001470	Rumors reach you that a gruff man at the Mojave Outpost is seeking to hire an experienced guide for the region. His appearance is supposedly connected to the recent bank robbery in Silver Springs. Speak to Walker to learn details of the job offer.

SEV00001480	Walker stuffs the bulk of the caps into his duffle and then slowly climbs up the northern cliffs. He pauses to recover near the top of the ascent. After catching his breath, he looks back and gives you a subtle nod. Soon thereafter he disappears over the ridgeline. It is uncertain if your paths will cross again in the future.

SEV00001554	You were absolutely right about Boudreaux. Hot damn, can that ghoul make magic in the kitchen! I can't understand most of what he says, but I'm getting the gist of it. The guy can perform miracles with the worst meats, even the bugs. He was made something called Étouffée, and holy shit I almost cried it was so good.
SEV00001555	Only downside is that he's a cranky old bastard, on top of the language barrier. You said he was a good friend of Bobby, right? Figures he'd be upset after what went down. Damn shame.
SEV00001556	Hope you're doing all right with the business up there with Bodeen. Might make my way up there eventually.

SEV00001560	We got the shipment of merchandise last week without any hiccups. A lot of clients are dishing out serious caps for these kids. 80s and the smaller gangs always like fresh recruits to indoctrinate, but the biggest client is that group up at Mount Irish. Something weird about those guys. Seen my share of cults, but something is off. If you've got business up here, keep your distance from that place.
SEV00001561	Otherwise, keep them coming. We're growing fast, been poaching muscle from the Vipers, 80s and other gangs. Not much other news from the north. El Reloj and Requin are still active, but that's all past 93, not in my territory. 
SEV00001562	One last thing - if you have spare manpower, send a crew to scout out the Sheep Range. Pretty sure some of the runaways are organizing a town up there. Need to nip that in the bud before it becomes a problem. Thanks again.
SEV00001563	Best,
SEV00001564	Bodeen
SEV00001565	Recipes - Blackened Radroach
SEV00001566	This recipe allows you to make Blackened Radroach.
SEV00001567	While I'm Away
SEV00001568	Cynthia, here are some notes for while I'm away:
SEV00001569	- Don't budge on the no-contact order for Steve and Oliver. They're both good earners, and I don't want their personal animosity causing a rift in the town. Keep the peace best as you can and threaten them in my name if need be. NO POISONING OF STEVE'S ROACHES!
SEV00001570	- Crack the whip any time you hear gossip about Nurse Wilkes. It was hard enough to get a medical professional out here, I don't want these whiners undermining her with smartass remarks or hearsay. She came highly recommended. I believe her bedside manner will improve in time.
SEV00001571	- Ramsay is not permitted to own slaves of any kind. Do not fall for his charms. We tried it once and it was a disaster. Armfield has threatened to shoot him for "destruction of property" on multiple occasions.
SEV00001572	- Tell Armfield if he impregnates another slave that he'll be a slave.
SEV00001573	- Cram. Remember that he's special. Don't let him speak at the town hall. He'll babble until the others start bullying him, then he'll get worked up and threaten to unleash that collection of freaks he keeps in the store. Speak softly and don't look him in the eyes for extended periods. He's a brilliant scavenger but he's simply off in the head. Also, be sure to compliment his posters. It helps his self-esteem.
SEV00001574	- Tell Todd to keep his singing to a minimum. In his shop, he can do whatever he wants, but singing in public places always causes friction. NO KILLING OF CLIENTS! WE'RE LIVING IN A SOCIETY! Yell if necessary.
SEV00001575	- Ensure Pietro pays his full rent. He's constantly inventing excuses, but don't accept them. He's just a cheapskate.
SEV00001576	Me and the cousins will be gone for a few weeks for a recruiting drive. There's a group of 80s who are planning to join up. Possibly some tribals, too. Gonna meet them on the road outside Mount Irish. Not too close to that place, hopefully. Let me reiterate - while I'm gone, you are the acting boss. Don't take any shit and use the cattle prod liberally. If anyone crosses you they'll answer to me. I have full faith in you.
SEV00001577	- Bodeen
SEV00001578	Dear Thief
SEV00001579	Dear Thief,
SEV00001580	I can only assume that I've long since passed out of this realm, so permit me to whisper a few humble requests from the grave.
SEV00001581	Do whatever you wish with the Legion tender. Few things have boosted my spirits like pilfering the vaults of those skirt-wearing savages, and it would delight my ghost if that coin was used for merriment, feasting and fornication. Defy the Legion by enjoying life's pleasures, I say.
SEV00001582	Please deliver the caps (all 5,000) and the reprint of Hygeia to Doctor Tyler at the Mormon Fort. She's a fine physician and a trusted friend, and this windfall should silence her excuses about building the clinic in Westside. Please resist the impulse to indulge in short-term profiteering. You will net a tidy sum from the other oddities in my safe. Please stifle your greed for one moment and assist the one worthwhile faction in this sandy pit.
SEV00001583	If by some chance you are my friend, Robert - I hope you and your hounds are healthy, and you are no longer living life in the shadows. You can always start over. Put down the gun. Find Lydia. Learn to love again. Eat your biscuits in peace.
SEV00001584	For all others - live long, live free and embrace the beauty of our world. Adieu!
SEV00001585	Regarding Sam
SEV00001586	&PCName;,
SEV00001587	I captured Sam when he tried to steal my favorite painting. My only painting, in fact. A Rembrandt. He killed five of my men before he succumbed to his injuries.
SEV00001588	I tortured him for six days. Very strong, even for a mutant. It was an impressive display of willpower. We held a number of extended discussions in that chamber. I was surprised to learn that he had only one friend aside from that mangy coyote - you. That's right. Blinded, flayed and bleeding from every pore, he only claimed you as a trusted compatriot.
SEV00001589	On that note, I'm informing you that your friend is dead, along with his coyote. He bequeathed you his house and all his ill-gotten belongings. Passing this message was the least I could do in light of his bravery.
SEV00001590	If the mood strikes you, seek me out at Ruby Lake. We'll have a grand old time.
SEV00001591	Sincerely,
SEV00001592	Requin
SEV00001593	Competiton
SEV00001594	A competitor has arrived in town. "Sly Oliver", he calls himself. A puffed-up, preening buffoon of a man, grinning like a chem-addled mutant, offering discounts and gambling to every fool in town!
SEV00001595	Gambling? What's gambling compared to the finest food and beer in town? 
SEV00001596	POSTERS? No one west of the Colorado has this collection of vintage ads, not even Joe Briggs. Oliver has one ugly Enclave poster! People don't even like the Enclave. More importantly, why in the hell is George Washington a dog? It's sub-kitsch, that's what it is.
SEV00001597	Atmosphere? People have a great time here. Every day they tell me the roaches are adorable! Oliver calls this place "Roach-infested"! I say it's "Roach-Blessed!" Uppity bastard better not insult Junior to my face.
SEV00001598	Oh, and the damn discounts. He's taking a loss right now, I know it. Bastard is probably fresh off some score and can float his charity bar for a while. He can keep the dregs and hobos who don't appreciate a fine establishment. We will perservere!
SEV00001599	MURDER
SEV00001600	OLIVER. POISONED. MY. ROACHES.
SEV00001601	Foul, unspeakable murder! Bodeen insists it could've been anyone, but I know it was Oliver. That sleazy circus performer can strut around in a pimp suit, acting like he's the emperor of commerce in the canyon, but I see him for what he is - a cold-blooded murderer!
SEV00001602	There will be a memorial service held tonight with incense and candles. Cram will provide Cram for attendees. I'm expecting a large turnout. I intend to lead a public procession down main street in order to shame that maniac. OPEN CASKET! Let everyone behold the senseless brutality of Oliver!
SEV00001603	I will make a formal appeal to Bodeen after the funeral. I'll invoke Roy Bee's name if I have to! I was here at the beginning! I stood beside Roy against the flies! I've bled for this canyon! Surely my babies are entitled to fair justice. Public hanging would be proportional.
SEV00001604	No Justice
SEV00001605	Bodeen has failed me.
SEV00001606	He dismissed my allegations against Oliver, citing "Lack of evidence". Where is the justice in Arrow Canyon? 
SEV00001607	I remember the days when we had order in this canyon, back when Roy Bee ran this town. Yes, we were an arnarchistic collection of slave-owning raiders, but by God we had a code! Roy was swift with his judgments. Impartial? Not necessarily, but he was decisive!
SEV00001608	If Bodeen can't provide justice, then I'll just make my own. It would be a damn shame if Oliver's joint was suddenly hit with a radroach infestation...
SEV00001609	Scouting Report: Alamo and Others
SEV00001610	Alamo is growing. Got a strong-willed sheriff from the look of it. Still have some slaves but they're transitioning over to the law-and-order stuff like Caliente. Could be a problem if they keep growing. Good water source and they're actively mining. Might be worth a look for infiltration.
SEV00001611	Went up to Tikaboo Peak since Garth told us there was a camp up there. Whoever was living there is gone now. Had a small settlement started from the look of things, but they all up and left. No signs of struggle or theft, everything was right where they left it. Just some strange burn marks left in the vegetation. Got an uneasy feeling so we left before sundown.
SEV00001612	Boss Red-Knife runs Crystal Springs now. Remains to be seen if he's as tough as his father. They're still loyal to the 80s. Collect plenty of tolls and slaves from the roads. Good location.
SEV00001613	- Mikey
SEV00001614	A New Beginning
SEV00001615	We are now open for business!
SEV00001616	What a turn of events. Ostracized and cursed in Alamo, pushed into the wilds with hardly a cap to my name, and here I am... reborn! This canyon has been slandered for too long - it is not the bug-infested, criminal cesspit as described by glib travellers! No, it is an oasis. A new Eden - or better yet, a new America!
SEV00001617	No taxation. No oppressive governments. No goddamn sheriff. Just a growing population of eager, free-spirited patrons with full pockets.
SEV00001618	I will make something special here. Those fools at Alamo will rue the day they cast me out of their stinking town. Damn that sheriff and his minions. Vengeance will be mine.
SEV00001619	The first step in my long, bloody road to justice - cupcakes. I will hold an open house with free drinks and chocolate cupcakes. Some have mocked this method, but I aver that it has never failed me. Even the most sinister, blood-spattered savage enjoys a cupcake. Yes, the bloody path starts with baked goods and beer. My vision is clear... now I will make it reality!
SEV00001620	Insulted
SEV00001621	The grand opening was a delight for almost everyone. Bodeen delivered a moving speech, Rinn complimented the construction (which he aided - at a cost), and Armfield's slaves danced for our amusement. Even Cram's monotone babbling about preservatives contained an odd kernel of charming factuality. It was perfect - until the roach-hugger spoke.
SEV00001622	Steve pointed out minor flaws in my slot machines. Pardon me, I hauled them across miles of arid wasteland. They're going to be a little weathered. Everyone else was pleased with them.
SEV00001623	Then he questioned the CO2 content in my beer. He opined that he was, "something of a beer snob" and could "taste the difference". Well, pardon my primitive brew, beermaster McRoach! At least I don't serve FUCKING ROACH MEAT! "Blackened" radroach? He's charring bugs with gunpowder and acting like it's the main course at the Ultra-Luxe! Insanity!
SEV00001624	Even those slights were forgiveable - but he crossed the line with his comment on my poster. No, I don't have a hodgepodge of low-budget film posters collected from every beshitted ruin in the wasteland. I have one poster - a pristine testament to the glory of the Enclave. He had the gall to snicker at the majesty of President Washington! I politely informed him that my grandfather served in the Enclave. He asked if my grandfather was a dog, too. It took all my willpower to refrain from stabbing him to death then and there! This will not stand!
SEV00001625	Curious thing, roaches. Very tough, but susceptable to poisoning. A little pest control is in order, I think.
SEV00001626	Slander
SEV00001627	Steve is mad. Nurse Wilkes should examine him (preferably with her sledgehammer) for signs of insanity. He's publically accused me of "murdering" his roaches.
SEV00001628	Murder. Of. Roaches.
SEV00001629	And I'm the suspect! Ridiculous!
SEV00001630	The mere accusation prompted more than a few guffaws from observers, only fueling his childish tantrum. A child, yes. Surrounded by silly posters, pet bugs and a dwindling number of patrons. He's desperate. It's no surprise that my roach-free business is gaining a greater share of the market.
SEV00001631	Later he held a funeral procession for his dead bugs. I once saw a mentally handicapped child hold a service for the charred remains of his pet squirrel. That had more dignity than Steve's cartoonish parade through the streets. It was an insult to this town, and to human decency as a whole. First, it's funerals for roaches. Next there's incest and bestiality. These are dark times for Arrow Canyon.
SEV00001632	Update On Kids
SEV00001633	Boss,
SEV00001634	I spoke with that trader who meets with the tribals at Quinn Canyon. He said your kids are healthy and fully invested in the tribal life. As you requested, they have no contact with the outside world and seem to be happy. That little group is pretty well isolated up in those mountains and only a handful of traders make contact with them, much less know they exist. If anything changes I'll let you know.
SEV00001635	- Mikey
SEV00001636	P.S. The boy is real hellraiser. Must take after his daddy.
SEV00001637	Scouting Report: Conclusion
SEV00001638	Saw Mount Irish from a distance. Had a few caravans coming in and out, looked peaceful at first. Then we watched a boy walk out on a cliff, cut his own tongue off, then jump off without blinking. I'm guessing we meet their slave trader far outside the town for a reason. I couldn't convince the boys to go in for a closer look, so we moved on.
SEV00001639	Scout from the 80s said Majors Place has a new Major. Mines are still cranking out metal but they're burning through slaves in the process.
SEV00001640	Commercial traffic is picking up out of Ghouldom. They're trading more with St. Thomas. It's still pretty poor, but they're getting more organized. Walls and militia now. Can't confirm, but the Legion may have a presence on the north shore now. Could be a problem.
SEV00001641	I did like you asked and did a thorough sweep of the Sheep Range. Weather was rough, lots of snow and poor visibility. Cobb is our best tracker and he didn't find anything. Just an abandoned church and some cabin. If there are any slaves up there, they're scattered and starving. All evidence suggests that San Salvador is a myth.
SEV00001642	Went further west to Saddle Mountain. Hills are teeming with Fire Ants. I heard rumors about a new settlement, but I didn't see signs of development.
SEV00001643	That concluded the survey. Lost two to Cazadors and one to Fire Ants. Otherwise it went smoothly.
SEV00001644	- Mikey
SEV00001645	Scouting Report: Moapa
SEV00001646	The warlord called Delicious is based out of a small compound outside Moapa. They're mostly nomadic, hence the small fort. He's strong, charismatic and determined. The rumors about mass cannibalism are not unfounded. He and his boys haul a giant barbecue pit with them everyone and turn every raid into a massive cookout. I won't lie - it smelled amazing. I swear most of that crew sticks around just to eat his cooking.
SEV00001647	His chief rival is King Coffee, who's affiliated with the Vipers. They have a larger compound up by Mormon Peak that supports some primitive agriculture. They're only part-time raiders from the look of them, plenty of women and children running around. Have some slaves that are carrying Armfield's brand.
SEV00001648	- Mikey
SEV00001649	Beauty will save the world.
SEV00001650	The Wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept.
SEV00001651	Without Sam's guidance, your party takes several days to reach the outskirts of Arrow Canyon. Your companions arrive exhausted, and will not be in peak condition for the coming fight. 
SEV00001652	Before making your approach, you elect to camp in a narrow gorge some distance from the canyon entrance. This is an opportune moment to confer with the other party members before the final confrontation with Bodeen.
SEV00001653	Campsite
SEV00001654	Walker takes a breath and then instructs Jed to leave. The Phillips soon make a hasty departure out of view. It is uncertain if your paths will cross again.
SEV00001655	Mercy
SEV00001656	There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.
SEV00001657	After waiting quietly for several hours, you notice a group of Powder Gangers creeping towards the ambush site.
SEV00001658	First in raids, first in building bridges and first in destroying bugs.
SEV00001659	As a leader, he bridged a gap between distant communities and led the way in building new infrastructure.
SEV00001660	As a warrior, he crushed our enemies, drove them before us and laughed at the lamentations of their women.
SEV00001661	As a mayor, he bravely led the fight against the marauding swarm of Dog Pecker Flies which almost destroyed our beloved town. Though he perished in the effort, Arrow Canyon endures and is buoyed by his indomitable spirit.
SEV00001662	Dedicated in 2279.
SEV00001663	Roy Bee, Founder.
SEV00001664	Lee collects his share and quietly strolls toward the exit of Arrow Canyon. Near the canyon's end he turns around and delivers a half-hearted wave. Soon after he disappears into the shadowy narrows of a gorge. It is uncertain if your paths will cross again in the future.
SEV00001665	Farewell
SEV00001666	Rumors reach you that a gruff man at the Mojave Outpost is seeking to hire an experienced guide for the region. His appearance is supposedly connected to the recent bank robbery in Silver Springs. Speak to Walker to learn details of the job offer.
SEV00001667	Seven Graves From Now

SEV00001671	After a night of restless sleep, you stir before dawn and gather your belongings. You and your fellow travellers swiftly make your way through the gorge into Arrow Canyon.
SEV00001672	Walker peers over a nearby ridge with binoculars and then returns with a grim expression on his face. He reports that the site is occupied by a large number of well-armed raiders. You are in for a lengthy fight.

SEV00001676	Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
SEV00001677	Cram.
SEV00001678	Walker stuffs the bulk of the caps into his duffle and then slowly climbs up the northern cliffs. He pauses to recover near the top of the ascent. After catching his breath, he looks back and gives you a subtle nod. Soon thereafter he disappears over the ridgeline. It is uncertain if your paths will cross again in the future.

SEV00001705	Before making your approach, you elect to camp in a narrow gorge some distance from the canyon entrance. This is an opportune moment to confer with the other party members before the final confrontation with Bodeen.
