WIL00000012	GREETING
WIL00000013	Hi there.
WIL00000014	How ya doin'?
WIL00000015	Yeah.
WIL00000016	Yeah, what is it?
WIL00000017	How ya doin?
WIL00000018	Let's go.
WIL00000019	So you're definitely going to work against the NCR?
WIL00000020	Are you planning to ally with the NCR, is that why you're running these errands for them?
WIL00000021	Mr. House isn't asking for much is he?  Just kill the entire BOS.  I think he's been a machine for so long he's forgotten what it's like to be human.
WIL00000022	I know you like Caesar, but did you have to fix his howitzer for him?
WIL00000023	I don't think bombing the monorail is going to send the NCR running back to California, do you?
WIL00000024	I hope you had fun.  I'm still mad at you.  And it'll be a couple of days before I'm done being mad at you.
WIL00000025	Boone's story about his wife is so sad.  I'm glad you're helping him.
WIL00000026	Are we going to have a drink?
WIL00000027	Do you have my drink?
WIL00000028	It's depressing here, isn't it?
WIL00000029	I wish there was something we could do to help out around here.
WIL00000030	I'm glad we're helping these guys out.
WIL00000031	Hey there.
WIL00000032	These guys don't seem so bad, huh?  They aren't high on chems. They aren't  trying to eat us. It could be a lot worse.
WIL00000033	This place is so big.
WIL00000034	What's up?
WIL00000035	The legion made quite a mess here, didn't they?
WIL00000036	Ugh! Radiation!  Are you set for chems?  I might have some extras in my scavenged stuff.
WIL00000037	Radiation. Always good for a few laughs, huh?
WIL00000038	This place is a mess.  You doin' okay? Think there's enough radiation around here?
WIL00000039	NCR as far as the eye can see.  You know, I feel right at home here.
WIL00000040	What's up?
WIL00000041	I can't believe what they did to this town.
WIL00000042	It's such a waste.  The whole town just gone.
WIL00000043	Hey there.
WIL00000044	I like it up here. It reminds me of home.
WIL00000045	It's beautiful up here, isn't it?
WIL00000046	What's up?
WIL00000047	Can we leave soon? I'll be a lot happier when we get out of here.
WIL00000048	Hey there.
WIL00000049	These guys make me nervous.  Stay close, okay?
WIL00000050	Hey there.
WIL00000051	The Nightkin are amazing!  The way they sneak...it gives them such an advantage.
WIL00000052	This place is kind of weird.
WIL00000053	So, we're back here again.
WIL00000054	So, how's Lucy today?
WIL00000055	Hey there.
WIL00000056	Hey, we got a lead on the guy in the checkered coat!  That was a good break, huh?
WIL00000057	Good job killing that Nipton-destroying Legion scum. I hope you took his stupid hat.
WIL00000058	Hi! Can I do something for you...or to you?
WIL00000059	My brother, Chuck, wanted to fight for the NCR.
WIL00000060	I feel like we're walking around inside a tin can in here.
WIL00000061	You're wearing the suit.  He's dead isn't he?  Good.  He deserved it.
WIL00000062	So Benny's dead.  I'm glad. He deserved it.
WIL00000063	You did it!  You killed Caesar!
WIL00000064	Whatever you did for Boone at Bitter Springs, it was good.  He seems much better now.
WIL00000065	I'm not sure what you did to Boone at Bitter Springs, but he seems worse than ever.  Weren't we trying to help him?
WIL00000066	What do you want?
WIL00000067	Hi, have you been missing me?
WIL00000068	You've never said anything about it. Do you like the presents I've been giving you in the mailbox?
WIL00000069	Hey! How's it going?
WIL00000070	<Yawn>
WIL00000071	I am so hungry!  Can we make that meal now?
WIL00000072	Hope you didn't mind the big kiss.
WIL00000073	Wow, that was wonderful. You were wonderful. I hope we can do that again sometime.
WIL00000074	Do you have a minute? I have something I want to talk to you about.
WIL00000075	Hi! Can I do something for you...or to you?
WIL00000076	Hey there.
WIL00000077	What's up?
WIL00000078	What's up?
WIL00000079	Sorry!
WIL00000080	What do you want?
WIL00000081	What's up?
WIL00000082	Are you ready?
WIL00000083	Hey there.
WIL00000084	Hey, you've got a plan, don't you?
WIL00000085	Tell me what you want and I'll do it.
WIL00000086	What's next?  A little gambling?  A little drinking?
WIL00000087	What's next?  Gambling? A show? A drink?
WIL00000088	I wouldn't mind leaving soon.  It's kind of quiet up here.
WIL00000089	This is quite a show isn't it?
WIL00000090	Pfft!  It's hot!
WIL00000091	What's up?
WIL00000092	Do you need something?
WIL00000093	Hi there, handsome!
WIL00000094	Don't you look gorgeous?
WIL00000095	Hey, Bud. What's up?
WIL00000096	Hey, Hon. What's up?
WIL00000097	Did you see that?
WIL00000098	Hi lover, need something?
WIL00000099	Hi! Can I do something for you...or to you?
WIL00000100	You bastards.
WIL00000101	I don't know if you know, but since Jeannie May passed, I've been keeping an eye on her properties for her.
WIL00000102	Bark
WIL00000103	Hi, Sarah.  I'm crashing the party.  I think we'll have a lot of fun.
WIL00000104	Veronica, we have to do something about your outfit.  It's tragic. You look like a potato with a face.
WIL00000105	I haven't been doing it very long, but I like to punch stuff too.  Maybe not as much as you do, but it is fun.
WIL00000106	Veronica, I've heard you guys can shoot lasers from your eyes, is it true?
WIL00000107	You haven't answered me about the eye lasers.  Can you? Can you shoot things with your eyes?
WIL00000108	Veronica, about the eye lasers. Come on, tell me about them.  Please?
WIL00000109	Veronica! I've got it! The eye lasers are weapons you carry or wear like helmets! They aren't IN your eyes; that was just dumb.
WIL00000110	Hi, my name's Willow. What do you do around here?
WIL00000111	Hi, I'm Willow. It looks like we're going to be spending a lot of time together.  I hope we can be friends.
WIL00000112	I was very sorry to hear about your wife, Boone.  If you ever feel like talking to someone or ever need anything I'd love to help.
WIL00000113	Boone, I was born and raised in the NCR; in Klamath.  I'm guessing you're going to keep quiet and not tell me anything about yourself. Right?
WIL00000114	You're awful good, Boone. I can see why they wanted you in the 1st Recon. Maybe if we get a chance sometime you could give me some tips?
WIL00000115	Okay, Boone, you are just too quiet.  If I confess to you that I hate Caesar and his legion will you talk to me?  Because it's true. I do hate him.
WIL00000116	Boone, tell me about Carla.  Where did you meet her?
WIL00000117	Hi!
WIL00000118	You doin okay?
WIL00000119	Um, I like you a lot, Boone.  I was hoping that maybe after we're out of this mess we could get to know each other a lot better.  What do you say?
WIL00000120	Boone, you can't blame yourself for Bitter Springs. You aren't responsible for what happened there. You're only one man and you're a good man.
WIL00000121	Boone, have you figured out yet how I feel about you?
WIL00000122	Boone, you were very brave to do what you did for Carla.  I admire you for it. Not every man could have done that. You're a true hero.
WIL00000123	Hey there.
WIL00000124	Nng. Hi.
WIL00000125	How's it goin?
WIL00000126	Careful! They got spies all over!
WIL00000127	Hi, there.
WIL00000128	Hi, there.
WIL00000129	Hi, there.
WIL00000130	Hi, there.
WIL00000131	Hi, there.
WIL00000132	What's up?
WIL00000133	What's up?
WIL00000134	What's up?
WIL00000135	What's up?
WIL00000136	Hi there, miss.
WIL00000137	How's it goin?
WIL00000138	What's up?
WIL00000139	Hey.
WIL00000140	The new Slave girls are quite beautiful.
WIL00000141	Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
WIL00000142	You aren't trusted here profligate.
WIL00000143	Keep barking and I'll feed you to a dog.
WIL00000144	What's up?
WIL00000145	Ooh, got any juicy gossip?
WIL00000146	Am I punching too much? I get carried away.
WIL00000147	I want...a dress.
WIL00000148	Where'd you come from?
WIL00000149	Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California.
WIL00000150	Hey.
WIL00000151	Hey.
WIL00000152	Hey.
WIL00000153	Hey.
WIL00000154	Hey.
WIL00000155	What is it?
WIL00000156	Goodbye.
WIL00000157	See ya, later.
WIL00000158	Those ferals are tough!
WIL00000159	Radiation!  Great.
WIL00000160	You doing okay?  Radiation!  What a pain.
WIL00000161	Okay, I have a question.  Am I starting to glow?
WIL00000162	I always wondered what it would feel like to be a ghoul...I think we might find out soon.
WIL00000163	I hate Deathclaws.  I peed my pants!
WIL00000164	Hmm....Deathclaws.
WIL00000165	It's okay, you can do this.
WIL00000166	*nervous humming*
WIL00000167	It's kinda dreary up here.
WIL00000168	Hey, does that robot cook for us?
WIL00000169	We should be ready for anything in here, you know?
WIL00000170	*nervous humming*
WIL00000171	You are going to think I'm such a coward right now, but I am very scared. This place is so spooky.
WIL00000172	*Screams* What was that?  Did you hear that?  Sorry, I am so jumpy. I do not like it in here.
WIL00000173	I am so glad you're with me.  I'd hate to be in here alone.
WIL00000174	I am so glad you're with me.  I'd hate to be in here alone.
WIL00000175	I hate vaults.  They are so creepy.
WIL00000176	Of all the places you've taken me, this, well, not my favorite.
WIL00000177	This place seems kind of cruel if you ask me.  Well, I'll make an exception for geckos and Deathclaws.
WIL00000178	How could any woman run a place like this? It's so barbaric?
WIL00000179	Have you noticed Lucy's voice?  It's so deep. I wonder if maybe she's really a boy dressed as a girl? That'd be a big surprise for someone, huh?
WIL00000180	How old do you think Lucy is?  Doesn't she seem old to you?  She seems old to me.
WIL00000181	Lucy's hair is a funny color. It doesn't look real to me. I wonder if she puts color on it somehow. I bet she has gray hair because she's so old.
WIL00000182	I will be so happy when we're done running these errands for Lucy.
WIL00000183	Deathclaw eggs!  She doesn't want much, does she?
WIL00000184	I used to hate ferals until one day I found one with a teddy bear.  Now I feel sorry for them. Although, I still hate to get into a fight with them.
WIL00000185	There are a lot of dead ghouls in here.  Hey, you don't think the ferals killed them, do you?
WIL00000186	This place hasn't been totally picked over. There's still some good stuff left to take out of here.
WIL00000187	I hope our mystery man turns out to be worth all of this.
WIL00000188	*nervous humming*
WIL00000189	That Haversham is crazy.  Who'd want to be a ghoul?
WIL00000190	That Haversham is crazy.  Who'd want to be a ghoul? Ah!  Oh, Raul, I'm so sorry!
WIL00000191	Bright is nuts too.  It's like we've stumbled into crazy town and he's the mayor.
WIL00000192	Remember those guys that took my stuff?  This is the place Stan talked about in his note.
WIL00000193	Maybe it's just me, but don't you want to walk right up to the Nightkin and stare right at them to see what they'll do?
WIL00000194	I hope Dr. Henry can fix Rex.
WIL00000195	Dr. Henry is an interesting guy, isn't he?
WIL00000196	Do you ever wonder what it was like to come to a place like this before The Great War?
WIL00000197	Invisible Nightstalkers. I wonder if that could ever happen to a human?
WIL00000198	I've got nothing against the girls.  But I think, if someone has a girl of their own, they don't belong with a prostitute.
WIL00000199	I like these guys.
WIL00000200	This is not a gift shop.
WIL00000201	Worst gift shop ever.
WIL00000202	Hmpf.  Who does she think she's impressing with this place? I'm not impressed.  You're not, are you?
WIL00000203	Hmpf.
WIL00000204	I always imagined a vault would be a terrible place to live. You know, cuz deserted vaults are so creepy.
WIL00000205	It's really nice in here.  Way better than I'd imagined a vault could be.
WIL00000206	This place is enormous.
WIL00000207	I know I shouldn't scavenge here, but I'm not promising anything.  If I see something good I might have to sneak it out with me.
WIL00000208	It's great to be among NCR folks again.  I feel right at home.
WIL00000209	This is a twitchy bunch. I don't trust them.
WIL00000210	Looks like everyone of these guys uses chems. Look at their eyes, their really messed up.
WIL00000211	Fiends, ugh.  I thought they smelled bad outside.
WIL00000212	I don't like vaults.  Even when they're crowded like this one.
WIL00000213	I've got nothing against the girls.  But I think, if someone has a girl of their own, they don't belong with a prostitute.
WIL00000214	I've got nothing against the girls.  But I think, if someone has a girl of their own, they don't belong with a prostitute.
WIL00000215	So this is home, huh? I can see why you like to get out.
WIL00000216	I can't believe you stuck one of us in that freezer.  That was heartless.  I hope I don't have to worry about what you'll do to me.
WIL00000217	I wonder what happened here. They must have set up all these traps for a reason.
WIL00000218	Robots, traps...I wonder what else we'll find in here?  Ooh! Maybe we'll find a safe filled with some really great loot!
WIL00000219	This is quite a show, isn't it?
WIL00000220	Ever heard of toilet wine?  Inmates make it.  I wonder if anyone makes it here?
WIL00000221	I hope you think it's okay to scavenge for stuff in a prison.  Don't give me away if I grab something, okay?
WIL00000222	I can't wait to see what we'll find. Do you think it's the treasure?
WIL00000223	I wonder what it will be?  Something really exciting I'm sure.  Why else would it have been hidden for so long?
WIL00000224	You know what this place needs?  More Sunset Sarsaparilla lamps.
WIL00000225	The robot, game thing?  He gives me the creeps.
WIL00000226	They were thorough.  It sure  looks like everyone's been wiped out.
WIL00000227	Should we be searching for survivors?  Maybe somebody managed to hide somewhere.
WIL00000228	We haven't seen any kids. Do you think they took them?
WIL00000229	You know, I don't think I'll ever forget this place.
WIL00000230	Eh, poor guy.
WIL00000231	Did you see the car over there on display?  It's on display because it has bullet holes in it.  My hat has bullet holes in it.
WIL00000232	I'm in love with that cowboy robot.
WIL00000233	Oof.  It's cold in here.
WIL00000234	Oof.  It's cold in here.
WIL00000235	I'll take a cave over a vault any day.  Caves usually have critters, which are not creepy.  Vaults...creepy.
WIL00000236	I'll take a cave over a vault any day.  Caves usually have critters, which are not creepy.  Vaults...creepy.
WIL00000237	Lakelurks!  That sound they make is incredible.  Does it vibrate through your whole head, too?
WIL00000238	Attack
WIL00000239	Holy Shit!
WIL00000240	Holy Shit!
WIL00000241	Damn it!
WIL00000242	Stop shooting at me, damn it!
WIL00000243	Ah!  You guys are making me so mad!
WIL00000244	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.  Ha! Eat that!
WIL00000245	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.  Ha! Eat that!
WIL00000246	Ants!
WIL00000247	Shit!  Do you need a hand over there?
WIL00000248	Deathclaws!
WIL00000249	Raul, we're up!
WIL00000250	Hey, Boone!  I bet I can take out more of these guys than you can!
WIL00000251	Sunny, it's geckos!
WIL00000252	I see red!
WIL00000253	Uniforms! You don't see that everyday!
WIL00000254	Ugh! Die already!
WIL00000255	Damn it! Ferals!
WIL00000256	Looks like we're having gecko for dinner tonight!
WIL00000257	I've got you now!  You're not getting away from me!
WIL00000258	Ya, take this you bitch!
WIL00000259	Bring it!
WIL00000260	Damn it!
WIL00000261	I've got your back!
WIL00000262	Damn it!
WIL00000263	Yeah, yeah, come on!
WIL00000264	.
WIL00000265	.
WIL00000266	Oh!
WIL00000267	Ow!
WIL00000268	Flee
WIL00000269	No, no, no, no, no. I..I'm out of here!
WIL00000270	No, I...I don't want to die, I don't want to die!
WIL00000271	Fine. Don't do it again.
WIL00000272	Hey, take it easy.
WIL00000273	Assault
WIL00000274	What the fuck?
WIL00000275	Hey! What is wrong with you?
WIL00000276	Watch it!
WIL00000277	Nice.
WIL00000278	Holy shit!
WIL00000279	Get down!
WIL00000280	Watch it!
WIL00000281	Glad that's over.
WIL00000282	Did you see that?
WIL00000283	Whoa! That was a workout, wasn't it?
WIL00000284	I hate it when you get beat up like that during a fight.
WIL00000285	I thought for sure one of us was gonna die back there.
WIL00000286	Damn legion!
WIL00000287	Wait here.
WIL00000288	Okay.  I'll see you later.
WIL00000289	Okay!  I'll keep myself busy while you're gone.
WIL00000290	Okay! I love you. See you soon.
WIL00000291	Okay. I'll be right here. Waiting. For you.
WIL00000292	<sigh> Why do I have to miss all the fun.
WIL00000293	You're leaving me here alone? I'm sure there's something we can do together.
WIL00000294	Bark!
WIL00000295	Let's trade equipment.
WIL00000296	Thank you!
WIL00000297	Yeah, of course.
WIL00000298	Okay, sure.
WIL00000299	Trade? Ha! You wanna give me something heavy to carry, don't ya?
WIL00000300	No, I won't trade with you. <laughs> Gotcha.
WIL00000301	Pant, pant.
WIL00000302	Enough about tactics.
WIL00000303	Great.
WIL00000304	Bark, bark!
WIL00000305	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
WIL00000306	Oh, flank, flank, flank.  I hate it back there. You're just so far away.
WIL00000307	Alright, if that's what you want.
WIL00000308	Okay.
WIL00000309	Bark, bark!
WIL00000310	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
WIL00000311	I'm ready.
WIL00000312	Pant, pant
WIL00000313	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
WIL00000314	Sure, what do you want to talk about?
WIL00000315	Pant, pant.
WIL00000316	Stay close to me.
WIL00000317	Great.  I like the company.
WIL00000318	Okay.
WIL00000319	Bark!
WIL00000320	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
WIL00000321	Sure.  Do you want me to get really, really close?
WIL00000322	Sure.
WIL00000323	Bark!
WIL00000324	I want you to use ranged weapons.
WIL00000325	Great. I love, love my gun.
WIL00000326	Great idea.  I love it.
WIL00000327	Switch to a melee weapon.
WIL00000328	Okay, sure.
WIL00000329	Sorry,  I'm not gonna do it. Remember? We talked about it?
WIL00000330	Bark, bark!
WIL00000331	Let's talk about something else.
WIL00000332	Whatever you say.
WIL00000333	Pant, pant.
WIL00000334	That's all. Let's get going.
WIL00000335	Let's get outta here.
WIL00000336	Pant, pant
WIL00000337	I want you to change your combat style.
WIL00000338	I'm all ears.  What's the plan.
WIL00000339	Bark, bark!
WIL00000340	Let's talk about your tactics.
WIL00000341	Okay.
WIL00000342	Bark, bark!
WIL00000343	Let's get going.
WIL00000344	Yeah, let's go.
WIL00000345	Hey, I'm glad you're back.
WIL00000346	Boy am I glad to see you. I have been so bored.
WIL00000347	I hope you had some fun while you were gone.
WIL00000348	Hey, I'm glad you're back.
WIL00000349	I missed you.
WIL00000350	Bark!
WIL00000351	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
WIL00000352	Great!  I'll just sit back and take it easy.
WIL00000353	<Whine>
WIL00000354	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
WIL00000355	Okay, but I do not like being Deathclaw bait.
WIL00000356	Bark!
WIL00000357	Hey, I could use a hand over here!
WIL00000358	Wake
WIL00000359	Damn Deathclaws!
WIL00000360	Uh, dammit.
WIL00000361	Uh.  My head.
WIL00000362	Well, that was a nice nap.  Now what?
WIL00000363	Groan.
WIL00000364	Uh!
WIL00000365	Ugh!  Dammit!  That...really....hurts!
WIL00000366	What are you doing out here all by yourself?
WIL00000367	I have my reasons. I'm not thrilled about being alone, but I wasn't going to sit around in the Mojave Outpost because of it.
WIL00000368	I'd like you to carry this for me. Please don't use it.
WIL00000369	Fine.  I won't touch it. I promise.
WIL00000370	Why don't you relax here for awhile.  I'll be back for you later.
WIL00000371	Alright, I'll just wander around here and find something to do.
WIL00000372	I'd like you to consider this your home and a place to stay here in the Mojave.
WIL00000373	No one has ever offered me a home before. Thank you.
WIL00000374	Would you mind going back to the house?  I'll catch up with you later.
WIL00000375	Alright.  I'll see you there later.
WIL00000376	Sure I can't talk you into coming with me? It's going to be really lonely without you.
WIL00000377	Please come with me? I think we can think of something to do while we're there.
WIL00000378	No offense, but you don't seem injured and you still have your gear. Is this some kind of scam?
WIL00000379	I used all my medical supplies on my leg.  That's why I'm moving around so well, but it's still sore.
WIL00000380	And it's impossible for me to prove I've been robbed. You'll just have to believe me.  I am telling the truth.
WIL00000381	Oh, wait.  I found this.  They dropped it.  The thieves dropped it.
WIL00000382	Maybe you should have stayed put. Sounds like things didn't work out like you planned.
WIL00000383	No. I didn't plan to lose my favorite rifle, run out of ammo and get injured.   I have never been this unlucky on the road before.
WIL00000384	I suppose you'd like me to help you fix your problem?  Give you a weapon and ammo or caps maybe?
WIL00000385	No, I don't need caps, but my pistol is currently useless to me. So, I do need ammo or a different weapon to go after them.
WIL00000386	Don't look at me. I have my own problems to handle. It was nice meeting you, but I'm leaving now.
WIL00000387	Wait!  I have a pistol, but no ammo and I'm still injured.
WIL00000388	Is there something I can do to help you out of this situation?
WIL00000389	Yes! Look at this. One of them dropped it. I think they'll be going to one of these places.  I want to start looking for them at the closest one.
WIL00000390	However, I have a problem.  I have a pistol, but no ammo.  That's gone too.
WIL00000391	Are you thinking of chasing these guys down alone?
WIL00000392	I'd rather not do it alone, but I will.  I want my stuff back.
WIL00000393	I'm not going to GIVE you anything.  But maybe we could work out a deal if you want my help.
WIL00000394	I have no caps to pay you, so how about this? After we get my stuff back I'll travel with you for awhile.
WIL00000395	I'm a great shot. I started hunting with my Dad was I was a little kid. Plus, I'm a lot of fun to have around.
WIL00000396	Sorry.  I'm out of here.
WIL00000397	Please. I need to go after my stuff.  Maybe I could trade you something for your help.
WIL00000398	Have you been traveling for a long time?
WIL00000399	Nearly two years. Usually I talk my way out of any problems, but these guys jumped me from behind. I didn't get the chance.
WIL00000400	Maybe I can help you get your rifle back...for a price.
WIL00000401	I have no caps to pay you, so how about this? After we get my stuff back I travel with you for a while.
WIL00000402	You're in a really tough spot. What can I do to help you out of this?
WIL00000403	I want to go after the guys who took my stuff. They dropped this. Will you come with me?  Maybe give me some ammo or a different weapon?
WIL00000404	So you want me to supply you for this little adventure and come with you?
WIL00000405	I'd love it if you came with. As for ammo I'll say this: I'm crap with a knife and I'm only a little better with my fists. So, it's up to you.
WIL00000406	But I'm willing to earn what you give me.  I'll travel with you for awhile if you like.  I'm a great shot and I'm great company.  What do you say?
WIL00000407	No, I didn't see anyone.  Are you alright?
WIL00000408	No, I'm not alright. They took my favorite rifle and some other stuff. I do have a pistol with me, but I've got no ammo for it and my leg is hurt.
WIL00000409	Hey, did you see a couple of guys on the road just now?  They robbed me!  Bastards.
WIL00000410	Alright.  That sounds good.  Let's get the equipment all sorted out and then we can leave.
WIL00000411	Okay, and thank you so much. My name's Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you. But, please do hurry.  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL00000412	How about this?  You sleep with me and then I'll do whatever you need to get your stuff back?
WIL00000413	How about this?  No and goodbye.
WIL00000414	Okay.  Sleep with me and I'll help you.
WIL00000415	No. I'll go back to the Mojave Outpost and find someone there.  I wanted to do this right now and not waste all that time.  But, no and goodbye.
WIL00000416	If you agree to travel with me for awhile I'll help you out. I could use the company on the road.
WIL00000417	Travel with you?  Okay, after we get my rifle back, I agree to travel with you for awhile.
WIL00000418	You're telling me the truth aren't you? Okay, I'll help you. But I want something in return.
WIL00000419	I have no caps to pay you. So how about this?  After we get my stuff back I'll travel with you for awhile.
WIL00000420	I'm a great shot. I started hunting with my Dad was I was a little kid. Plus, I'm a lot of fun to have around.
WIL00000421	You sound awfully confident.  What if we don't find your stuff?  How will you repay me?
WIL00000422	What if I agree to travel with you for awhile whether we find my rifle or not. I'm a great shot and I'm a lot of fun to have around.
WIL00000423	You need me to supply you in order to follow these guys?  Do you also want me to come with you?
WIL00000424	Yes!  I would be so grateful.  Maybe I could repay you some way.  I don't have caps, but would you be interested in some company on the road?
WIL00000425	I'd be willing to travel with you for awhile, take night watch, kill critters, stuff like that.  I'm fun to have around. What do you say?
WIL00000426	Okay, I'll do it. Let's get ready to go.
WIL00000427	I'm Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you.  And thank you so much.  This means the world to me.
WIL00000428	I'll agree to that.  But what if we don't find your stuff? Then what?
WIL00000429	I don't want to consider that possibility. But I'll travel with you for awhile whether we find my stuff or not.  That seems fair.
WIL00000430	Okay, I'll agree to that.  Let's get organized and then we'll get going.
WIL00000431	Thank you so much.  My name's Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you.  And, can we hurry?  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL00000432	And here. You should see this. They dropped it. I'm guessing it's where they're headed. I want to start looking at the closest location.
WIL00000433	What if we don't find your stuff?  I want your word that you will travel with me either way.
WIL00000434	I don't want to think about that possiblity.  But, alright, yes, you have my word.  I'll travel with you either way.
WIL00000435	I want your word that you will travel with me whether we find your rifle or not.
WIL00000436	I don't even want to think about that possibility, but, yes, I agree to travel with you whether we find my rifle or not.
WIL00000437	Let's get going.
WIL00000438	Great!  Listen! I want to tell you exactly what I lost so you'll know what to look for, okay?
WIL00000439	You know about my rifle, Beauty.  That's what I call her. And there are two other things. Chester, a teddy bear I've had forever, and Moira, a doll.
WIL00000440	I hope we find the toys. I'm embarrassed to admit this and know it sounds stupid, but I do love them.
WIL00000441	I need to see that pistol of yours. I don't know if I have ammo for it or not.
WIL00000442	Oh, sure, of course.
WIL00000443	You're angry.  I'm sorry.  Can we start over?
WIL00000444	Yeah, I am angry. You were an ass.  But since you've apologized and you seem sincere enough, sure we can start over.
WIL00000445	So, here's the deal.  I found this.  I've lost a bunch of stuff, including my favorite rifle and I want to chase down these guys and get it back.
WIL00000446	I need ammo, if you have it, for the pistol I'm carrying and backup if you're interested. So, what do you say? Oh, and my name's Willow, by the way.
WIL00000447	I'll do it...if you sleep with me. <huge laugh> I'm just kidding. Let's go get your stuff back.
WIL00000448	Seriously?  And you don't want anything in return from me?
WIL00000449	No, I don't want anything from you. I feel really bad about what I said to you.
WIL00000450	Thank you.  That's very sweet of you. I appreciate it very much.  I'd love to leave as soon as possible.
WIL00000451	I won't lie.  I think you're very attractive.  But I don't want anything from you for this.
WIL00000452	Oh, thank you. Your not so bad yourself. Do you think we could leave as soon as possible?
WIL00000453	I do want something from you.  But not as payment.  Let's just see how things go.
WIL00000454	Oh, well, uh, alright.  We'll just see how things go, then. Can we leave as soon as possible?  I'm anxious to get my stuff.
WIL00000455	Okay.  I'll help you.  Let's go get your stuff.  And don't worry about paying me back.
WIL00000456	Why are you being so generous?  This is a lot to do for someone you don't know for nothing in return. Not that I'm not grateful.
WIL00000457	I acted like an ass earlier.  I'd like to make that up to you.
WIL00000458	Thank you.  I appreciate that very much.  Can we leave soon?  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL00000459	I like you and I'd like to spend more time with you.  Even if it does involve chasing criminals.
WIL00000460	Well, thank you, you're not so bad yourself.  Can we start chasing those criminals soon?  I'd really like to get outta here.
WIL00000461	I do want something from you, but not as payment for anything. We'll just have to see how things go.
WIL00000462	Thanks for helping me, but, yeah, we'll just have to see what happens. And do you think we could leave soon?  I'm anxious to get out of here.
WIL00000463	Would you stay here and wait for me?  I'll be back for you later.
WIL00000464	Alright, if that's what you want. But don't leave me here long, okay?
WIL00000465	Can I look at what you're carrying right now?
WIL00000466	Um, sure.
WIL00000467	Would you wait here for me? I'll be back for you soon.
WIL00000468	I will, but please hurry.
WIL00000469	Let's go.
WIL00000470	Yeah, let's go.
WIL00000471	I had fun with you and Red Lucy, but I still don't want you to pay too much attention to her, okay?
WIL00000472	Wow, Sarah is bad at sex!  She's as bad at sex as she is with giftshops.
WIL00000473	I'm sure Caesar is going to be very proud of you for killing Kimball.  I hope he rewards you well.  Better than when you saved his life.
WIL00000474	I will be so happy when we're done running these errands for Lucy.
WIL00000475	Deathclaw eggs!  She doesn't want much, does she?
WIL00000476	Exploding ants aren't as much fun as I thought they'd be.
WIL00000477	So, you're passing bad Intel to the NCR from the legion? Hmpf.
WIL00000478	Poor Kimball.  It's too bad the solution had to be so final.
WIL00000479	Lucy's hair is a funny color. It doesn't look real to me. I wonder if she puts color on it somehow. I bet she has gray hair because she's so old.
WIL00000480	How old do you think Lucy is?  Doesn't she seem old to you?  She seems old to me.
WIL00000481	Have you noticed Lucy's voice?  It's so deep. I wonder if maybe she's really a boy dressed as a girl? That'd be a big surprise for someone, huh?
WIL00000482	The Nightkin are amazing when they sneak, aren't they?
WIL00000483	You know, sometimes I really miss Boone.
WIL00000484	Ears for the guy at Camp Forlorn Hope. Heads for the guy at McCarran.  The NCR is more bloodthirsty that I thought!
WIL00000485	I can't believe we're getting ears for that guy at Camp Forlorn Hope. It's disgusting.  I don't want to carry 'em, you know.
WIL00000486	It's so cool up here. It's a nice break from the heat.
WIL00000487	Maybe after I've seen the Mojave I'll go back to Novac to live. Wouldn't it be fun to stay in one of those little bungalows at the motel?
WIL00000488	A guy at the Mojave Outpost told me there's some horrible nest of Deathclaws near a place called Sloan.  We're not going there are we?
WIL00000489	I wonder if those ants at Boomtown really explode.  If it's true, that'd be worth seeing, don't you think?
WIL00000490	Raising that plane off the bottom of the lake was one of the neatest things I've ever seen.  Whoosh!
WIL00000491	It's too bad the Fiends are such assholes.  I like those scary helmets they wear.  I'd love to wear one.
WIL00000492	Why don't you do right, like some other men do. Get out of here, give me some money too.
WIL00000493	*sings with no words*
WIL00000494	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.
WIL00000495	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed him and he kissed me.
WIL00000496	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed her and she kissed me.
WIL00000497	*sings with no words*
WIL00000498	I'm so blue without you, thought our love was true, then you found someone new.
WIL00000499	Waiting, watching the stars above. Hoping that I could win back your love.
WIL00000500	You loved me so, but let me go. Now I'll never know how our love will grow.
WIL00000501	Blue moon you saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.
WIL00000502	*sings with no words*
WIL00000503	*sings with no words*
WIL00000504	Why don't you do right, like some other men do.  Get out of here, give me some money too.
WIL00000505	*hums*
WIL00000506	*hums*
WIL00000507	*yawns*
WIL00000508	I'm starving.
WIL00000509	I'm hungry.  Oh, that's all I talk about, huh?   Food.  I guess I should talk about something else once in awhile.  But, I like food a lot.
WIL00000510	Thanks again for my present. I'm snacking on it right now.
WIL00000511	I'm going to eat the present you gave me.  Thanks again for being so sweet to me.
WIL00000512	I'm gonna have a Dog Biscuit, do you want one too?
WIL00000513	Hold up.  I'm thirsty and want a drink. I can't keep up the pace and drink at the same time.  I'll fall flat on my face.
WIL00000514	Hold up.  I'm thirsty and want a drink.  You look like you could use one too.
WIL00000515	I'm famished.  Do you think we could stop for a campfire and a proper meal?
WIL00000516	Yawn,  I sure could go for some coffee.
WIL00000517	I'm sleepy.  Are we going to stay out all night?
WIL00000518	I know you're carrying dogmeat on you. I sure hope you don't expect me to cook that for you.  Eww, or watch you eat it.
WIL00000519	Hey, if we run into any geckos I could use some meat. For cooking.
WIL00000520	I hate being stung by those stupid things. It ruins my whole day.
WIL00000521	Did you hear that?  Huh. Maybe I imagined it.
WIL00000522	Do you smell that? Ugh, it's awful!
WIL00000523	Have I told you about the time that...wait do you hear that?
WIL00000524	I'm getting soaked back here! Were you thinking maybe we'd take a break inside, somewhere? Sometime? While it's raining, maybe?
WIL00000525	I sure miss Big George sometimes. He was such a great dog.
WIL00000526	Did you see that?  I have never seen two of anything doing that before.  Wow.
WIL00000527	Ow!  Dammit!
WIL00000528	Oof.  It's hot.
WIL00000529	You know I want to learn to box, right? Well, I have 4 older brothers who used to beat me up as a kid. I'd love to pay them back when I get home.
WIL00000530	I only have brothers. Five brothers.  Four older ones and a baby brother who's five years younger than me. I always wanted a sister.
WIL00000531	Do you eat Pre-War food? I don't trust most of it, but I can't resist Fancy Lad Snack cakes, or gumdrops, or Junk Food, ooh but Salisbury Steak? Ugh.
WIL00000532	I'm sneaking up behind a gecko, right? And I'm about to break cover when suddenly a Deathclaw runs up and grabs it. I swear I peed my pants.
WIL00000533	I told you about the motel my parents own, right? My mom does most of the cooking for the guests. She's the one that taught me how to cook.
WIL00000534	One time, when I was out exploring with one of my brothers, we found some Pre-war dog toys. A couple of them still squeaked.
WIL00000535	My mom, Coleen, makes the best coffee I've ever tasted. Everybody loves it, not just me. I try to make it, but it's never as good as hers.
WIL00000536	I love to collect things. You should see my room back home. It's so stuffed with junk I can't get to my bed. My mom is always complaining about it.
WIL00000537	Have I ever told you about the time my dog, Big George, cornered a baby molerat and its mom got so mad she nearly killed us both?  I sure miss him.
WIL00000538	My oldest brother, Val, is a doctor.  He tried to teach me some doctoring, but I just couldn't get the hang of it.  He says I'm all thumbs.
WIL00000539	My brothers, Sam and Dean, once hunted down a giant Gecko that was terrorizing the Grazing Grounds in Klamath.  They got a big reward for it.
WIL00000540	So, one day this lady runs into Val's clinic yelling her head off that her baby's sick. Val unwraps the blanket and inside he finds a baby Molerat!
WIL00000541	Chuck told me that he once kicked a guy so hard in the head that his helmet flew up in to the top of a 50 foot tree and got stuck there.
WIL00000542	Someday when I have kids I want to have five or six.  I love my big family.  There's always so much going on. It's never boring.
WIL00000543	When my friend Bethie and I were little we used to go visit this old lady named, Madame Zelda.  She lived with nine molerats!
WIL00000544	Madame Zelda made potions and she would read our palms and tell our fortunes.  Her predictions came true a lot!
WIL00000545	Madame Zelda once told me that I'd travel to New Vegas and meet the love of my life there.  Interesting, huh?
WIL00000546	Did I tell you that Brian played the guitar? Because Madame Zelda once told us that Bethie would marry a guitar player.
WIL00000547	It's quiet in the Mojave.You know, some places you go it's noisy; there's more birds, plants, animals and they all make noise. I like the peace here.
WIL00000548	What is it? Do you see something?
WIL00000549	What's going on?
WIL00000550	Bring it on!
WIL00000551	I have Moira.
WIL00000552	I'm thrilled to have Moira back, but I'd still like to find Chester.
WIL00000553	I don't know where Chester is, we've followed the trail we had. Do you have any ideas?
WIL00000554	Uh, well, yeah, I do, actually.  It's kind of embarrassing. I think the guy I was traveling with might have him.  He was helping me carry my stuff.
WIL00000555	We parted ways at the Mojave Outpost.  He was the big, strong quiet type.  Great for carrying stuff, but not a lot of fun. He didn't talk much.
WIL00000556	I have an idea where we might find him.  He wouldn't say much about himself, but he did talk a little bit about where he was going.
WIL00000557	We didn't go to both places listed on the note. We can keep going if you'd like.
WIL00000558	That's a good idea. But, I've been thinking about it, and, although, this is very embarrassing to admit, I don't think I had Chester with me.
WIL00000559	I think the guy I was traveling with might have him. He was carrying some of my stuff for me. We parted ways at the Mojave Outpost.
WIL00000560	He's the big, strong quiet type. Not much fun, but great for carrying stuff. I didn't get many details out of him, but I think I know where he is.
WIL00000561	I'm sorry about Chester, but I need to get on with my business now. Maybe we can look again later.
WIL00000562	You might not be interested, but there's something I want to tell you.  I don't think I had Chester with me when I was robbed.
WIL00000563	I think I left him with the guy I'd been traveling with. I put Chester in with his stuff. It was a joke. I think I forgot him there.
WIL00000564	I feel stupid I made such a mistake and do still want to find Chester. If you ever change your mind I'll be ready.
WIL00000565	Are you suggesting we track him down to get Chester?
WIL00000566	Well, yeah, I am. If you decide you're interested, I'll tell you everything I know about where he may be.
WIL00000567	So maybe we shouldn't bother looking anymore and just find this guy?
WIL00000568	I can't swear he has Chester, but he was carrying him at one point. It was a joke and then I forgot he had him. I just can't remember for sure.
WIL00000569	You sound so uncertain.  I'll think about it.
WIL00000570	Okay, but I'm willing to talk about it again at any time.  I still want to find Chester very much.
WIL00000571	I think we should try looking at the other location and then decide what to do.
WIL00000572	Okay.
WIL00000573	Tell me about Chester.  Where is this guy you were traveling with?
WIL00000574	He wouldn't say much. Mostly when I asked him something all he'd say was,"Not your business." But, I did get a few details out of him.
WIL00000575	Apparently he has a brother, or maybe it's a friend, who's a ghoul, who came here to join some cult.  The Bright Followers or something.  Near Novac.
WIL00000576	He's going there to find the brother, or friend, to take him home again, I guess. That was all I could get out of him.  He wasn't much of a talker.
WIL00000577	[Lie] I don't have Moira.  I'm sorry.
WIL00000578	I don't believe you. I think you have her.  We will not be traveling together long if you plan on lying to me very often.
WIL00000579	Um, okay. You caught me. I do have her.  Sorry about that.
WIL00000580	You were an ass earlier and now you've lied to me. Lie to anyone else, but not me. I don't like traveling with someone I can't trust.
WIL00000581	And for now, while we are traveling together, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to keep looking for Chester.  I've had him since I was a little girl.
WIL00000582	Please don't lie to me.  Lie to anybody else, but not me. I want to be able to trust the person I'm traveling with, okay?
WIL00000583	And I'm still very interested in looking for Chester.  Can we make time for that in our travels?  I've had him since I was a little girl.
WIL00000584	[Lie] No, really, I don't have her.  You're wrong.  I wouldn't lie to you.
WIL00000585	Alright, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  But if you do have her, and I find out for sure, I won't just forgive and forget.
WIL00000586	Hey! Give her back! I can't believe you took Moira from me!
WIL00000587	You're welcome, Willow.
WIL00000588	I promised I would travel with you if we found Beauty. So, should we talk about this?  Iron out some details?
WIL00000589	Talk?  What is there to talk about?  You're going to follow me around and do whatever I say, right?
WIL00000590	Um, no.  I have no intention of doing that. We definitely need to talk.
WIL00000591	Oh, your teasing me, aren't you?  That was a good one. Yeah, you got me. Right? That was a joke.
WIL00000592	Yeah, sure.  Whatever you want.
WIL00000593	Hey, I'm trying to be serious here. We should probably get some things cleared up before we hit the road.  I want us to get along.
WIL00000594	Yes, let's do this.  I'd like to be very clear about how we're going to do things.
WIL00000595	Oh, good.
WIL00000596	Is there anything in particular you want to talk about?
WIL00000597	Yes!  I can't fight with anything other than a gun. I'm lousy at anything else.  Okay, I can fight with my fists if I'm cornered... by a radroach.
WIL00000598	I'd love to learn more, and would be willing to study, but for now I'm pretty useless. I just wanted to be really clear about that.
WIL00000599	So, don't expect me to fight with anything other than a gun. Okay?  I won't do it.  Not with my skills the way they are now.
WIL00000600	Okay.  What if we trained you somehow?  Is that possible?
WIL00000601	Yeah, I read books and magazines about Boxing to learn what I can. But, they're hard to find.  I've only ever found a couple.
WIL00000602	But if I can read enough of them I figure eventually I'll get good enough to be able to use better weapons and kick some ass in a fight.
WIL00000603	Oh! Oh, oh, oh!  You know what would be even better?  If we found someone to train me! Are you any good with your fists?
WIL00000604	No problem.  I don't really care.  I prefer guns myself.
WIL00000605	Oh, I'm glad you don't mind.
WIL00000606	I read books and magazines about Boxing to learn what I can. But, they're hard to find.  I've only ever found a couple.
WIL00000607	But if I can read enough of them I figure eventually I'll get good enough to be able to use better weapons and kick some ass in a fight.
WIL00000608	Oh! Oh, oh, oh!  You know what would be even better?  If we found someone to train me! Are you any good with your fists?
WIL00000609	I'm not happy about this, Willow. What else won't you do?
WIL00000610	Hmm, what seems like the best plan? I could fight with my fists if you asked me to, probably getting really hurt in the process and doing you no good
WIL00000611	or since I'm a great shot, I can use a gun, and effectively protect myself and you. It seems silly for me to use anything but a gun right now.
WIL00000612	But, if you only travel with people who can use a knife or their fists then, yeah, I'm not your girl. Unless you're willing to train me up.
WIL00000613	Train you?  How would I do that?
WIL00000614	Just give me any books or magazines you find about boxing I'll read them.
WIL00000615	Eventually I figure I'll learn enough to use better weapons and be able to hold my own in a fight.
WIL00000616	Oh! Oh, oh, oh!  You know what would be even better?  If we found someone to train me! Are you any good with your fists?
WIL00000617	No, I don't want to worry about training.
WIL00000618	Fine, forget I said anything about it. But I won't fight with anything but a gun.
WIL00000619	I've found Beauty.
WIL00000620	Thank you!
WIL00000621	I have Chester.
WIL00000622	Thank you for helping me.  It means the world to me that you took the time to do this.
WIL00000623	Did you find Moira or Chester?
WIL00000624	I have something to tell you. I will ask you to carry items I don't want you to use or touch.
WIL00000625	Well, that's no fun, I can look at them can't I? Alright,  I'm willing to do that.
WIL00000626	Do you have anything else?
WIL00000627	I have something for you.  It's a radio.  My dad got them for me.  One for me and one for whoever I was traveling with.
WIL00000628	He was worried about me going out on my own and thought this might make me that much safer.
WIL00000629	They're broken now and can only receive messages, but since you have that computer with you we'll be able to use them.
WIL00000630	You'll be able to talk to me because of it. I met someone else with one of those and it worked great.
WIL00000631	Alright, if that's everything I guess we should consider ourselves partners on the road for awhile.
WIL00000632	I can't think of anything else, let's go.
WIL00000633	Forget it. I don't want you back that much.
WIL00000634	Yeah, I figured as much.
WIL00000635	Yes, let's go.
WIL00000636	No.  I'm not coming back with you.  You sent me away and said you didn't want to be with me any more.
WIL00000637	So, if you want me back you're going to have to do something to prove to me you want me back.
WIL00000638	No, sorry I can't train you.  I don't have the skills.
WIL00000639	Oh.  Well, maybe we'll find someone else who can.
WIL00000640	Yes, I do have the skills.
WIL00000641	Oh, that's great news!
WIL00000642	I found Beauty and you helped me so much! Thank you.
WIL00000643	Is there something else?
WIL00000644	I forgot to ask.  What's your name?
WIL00000645	Let's go.
WIL00000646	No. I'm good. Thanks.
WIL00000647	I'm done.  Do you have anything to talk about?
WIL00000648	Yeah, let's go.
WIL00000649	Alright. Let's go.
WIL00000650	Yeah, let's go.
WIL00000651	I'm ready. Let's go.
WIL00000652	Let's hit the road.
WIL00000653	Whatever you say, boss.
WIL00000654	Alright. See ya later.
WIL00000655	Bye!
WIL00000656	Can I talk to you about something for a minute...
WIL00000657	Sure.
WIL00000658	I'm done. Is there anything you want to talk to me about?
WIL00000659	No.  I'm good.  Thanks.
WIL00000660	Are you still interested in me giving you some hand-to-hand combat training?
WIL00000661	Yes! Can we do it now?
WIL00000662	Let's do that training now.  Are you ready?
WIL00000663	Yes! Absolutely!
WIL00000664	Sorry, we'll have to do it later.
WIL00000665	Oh, alright. But don't forget.
WIL00000666	Okay, sure, we can do it now.
WIL00000667	Great.
WIL00000668	Yes, Willow?  You want to talk about Unarmed training?
WIL00000669	You know how you've been helping me learn to fight better with my fists?  Well, I think I'm good enough to do it for real now.
WIL00000670	And look what I've been saving to use someday.  So, I can fight now, any time with them.  Pretty exciting, huh?
WIL00000671	I have a boxing magazine. Do you want to read it?
WIL00000672	Yes, I do.  Thank you.
WIL00000673	I found a book about boxing. Do you want to read it?
WIL00000674	Yes, I do.  Thank you.
WIL00000675	Give me what you've stolen from Willow and I'll let you walk away from here.
WIL00000676	Get lost!
WIL00000677	Stopping to talk to me was a big mistake...it makes you a better target.
WIL00000678	Come on!
WIL00000679	It's the guys who took my stuff!
WIL00000680	I might have. What did they look like?
WIL00000681	I don't know.  They looked like regular guys. There were two of them. One had very bright red hair and the other one was wearing some kind of helmet.
WIL00000682	Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
WIL00000683	I think we should stop traveling together.
WIL00000684	Seriously?  You want to stop traveling with me?
WIL00000685	Oh, no, that sounds very final, doesn't it. Forget I said anything. Stay with me.
WIL00000686	Okay, I will. Are you messing with me?
WIL00000687	Yes, I want you to leave. It's not you. It's me. I need my space.
WIL00000688	Fine. I'll go find someone else to travel with..are you sure this is what you want?
WIL00000689	Fine. I'll go find somebody else to travel with..I don't need you.  Are you sure this is what you really want?
WIL00000690	Yes, I want you to leave. It's not you. It's me. I need my space.
WIL00000691	Would you please go back to the Suite at the Lucky 38 and wait for me there?
WIL00000692	Without you?  Alright, but it won't be any fun. I don't like it there.
WIL00000693	Give me what you've stolen from Willow and I'll let you walk away from here.
WIL00000694	Nevermind.
WIL00000695	Oh, okay.
WIL00000696	Oh!  Do you see that giant, uh, gecko, whatever that is, over there?  Can we go see that? I bet you can go inside.
WIL00000697	Here you go, it's a Sunset Sarsaparilla mug.  Do you like it?
WIL00000698	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00000699	Would you mind keeping watch here for awhile?
WIL00000700	Yeah, I can do that. No problem.
WIL00000701	I've heard about the ghouls outside of Novac.  I know where they are.
WIL00000702	You have?  That's great.  Can we go there?
WIL00000703	The Bright Followers aren't there any more.  Well, most of them that I know about anyway.
WIL00000704	I don't think that matters.  It doesn't mean that he hasn't gone there looking for his friend.
WIL00000705	Let's go find your friend. What's his name?
WIL00000706	His name.  Yeah, well, I just call him The Big Guy.  He never told me his name in all the time we were together. Weird, isn't it?
WIL00000707	So, I guess you'll need his description. He's very tall, and he wears a cowboy hat with a feather.  Oh, and he's a ghoul.
WIL00000708	Thanks for filling me in.  We'll check it out if I get the time to do it.
WIL00000709	Oh, alright.  I hope there's something to find when we finally get there.
WIL00000710	Yes.  We can go there and look for Chester.
WIL00000711	We can? Right now? Well, let's go.
WIL00000712	Oh, and you'll want to know who you're looking for, right?  He's a big, tall ghoul and he always wears a cowboy hat with a feather in it.
WIL00000713	I don't know his name, if you can believe it.  I just called him The Big Guy the whole time we were together. He has a dog with him named J.T.
WIL00000714	Eventually.  We'll get there when we get there.
WIL00000715	Okay, I understand.  I'll try to be patient.
WIL00000716	I agree.  I think we should go there now.
WIL00000717	Great.  Let's go.
WIL00000718	Oh, and you'll want to know who you're looking for, right?  He's a big, tall ghoul and he always wears a cowboy hat with a feather in it.
WIL00000719	I don't know his name, if you can believe it.  I just called him The Big Guy the whole time we were together. He has a dog with him named J.T.
WIL00000720	It's true.  But he's probably left by now.  There's no need for us to rush to get there.
WIL00000721	Fine.  I sure hope there's some trace of him when we finally get there.
WIL00000722	I'm no threat.  I'm not feral.
WIL00000723	Yes, I can see that.
WIL00000724	Why are you here?
WIL00000725	Great. Can you answer some questions for me?  Wow, you have unusual hair for a ghoul.
WIL00000726	I take great care of my appearance. I was a performer on The Strip for quite a long time before I came her to be with Jason and the Followers.
WIL00000727	Back then, my looks kept me employed...and busy...and near the bright lights and interesting people...but I shouldn't go on about that.
WIL00000728	I'll just say, thank you, as a lady should.  I really think it's my best asset after my smile.  Don't you agree?
WIL00000729	Oh, yes, absolutely.  I'm looking for someone.  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL00000730	<laughs nervously>  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL00000731	I'd say your hair is your best asset, since you're asking. I don't see the charm in rotting teeth.
WIL00000732	Well, your manners aren't the best, but you're honest.  What can I do for you?
WIL00000733	You mean Jefferson isn't here?
WIL00000734	I told him that Jefferson had gone out into the Mojave, as other Followers have done before him, but that he had never returned.
WIL00000735	We assumed he had died.
WIL00000736	Do you know why he keeps coming back everyday if Jefferson is dead?
WIL00000737	No, I don't know why he keeps coming back.  But, I like seeing him so I haven't tried to make him stop.
WIL00000738	When do you expect him today?
WIL00000739	I really don't know. Some days I don't see him until three or four in the afternoon.
WIL00000740	I do know he stays out at that camp by the gate.  There's a bed. He sleeps there.
WIL00000741	Ok, thanks.  Why are you here?  Why didn't you go off in the rockets with Jason and the others?
WIL00000742	I missed the launch.  I was away in the Wasteland and I don't know, really, what to do with myself...now.
WIL00000743	I'd like to go with him.
WIL00000744	But I don't know if he'll take me.  I haven't the courage to ask him.
WIL00000745	Ok, thanks. What is this place?  Why are you here?
WIL00000746	This is the home of the Bright Followers.  Jason Bright is the leader.
WIL00000747	I'm tired of Jason, and this place, and the Followers and would love to run away with him.
WIL00000748	But, I don't know if he'll take me I haven't the courage to ask him.
WIL00000749	Ok, thanks.  Bye.
WIL00000750	See ya later.
WIL00000751	I'm looking for someone.  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL00000752	Yes, he comes by everyday to see me.  Well, not me, he's looking for that Jefferson fellow.
WIL00000753	But I like to think he's looking for me. I have such a crush on him. He's so big and tall and handsome.
WIL00000754	I'm looking for someone.  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL00000755	Would you like me to talk to him for you? I can ask him to take you with him when he leaves.
WIL00000756	Yes, that would be wonderful.
WIL00000757	Thanks for your help. Goodbye.
WIL00000758	See ya later.
WIL00000759	Oh, what's your name?  I'll be sure to ask him when I speak to him.
WIL00000760	It's Jessica, and thank you for helping me.
WIL00000761	Goodbye.
WIL00000762	See ya later.
WIL00000763	Thank you so very much. I must get ready to go now.
WIL00000764	Ok, thanks. Why are you hanging around out here?
WIL00000765	I'm tired of Jason, and this place, and the Followers and would love to run away with him.
WIL00000766	But, I don't know if he'll take me I haven't the courage to ask him.
WIL00000767	Good dog!
WIL00000768	Bark, bark!
WIL00000769	You're a good looking fella, aren’t you?
WIL00000770	Pant, pant.
WIL00000771	Wish I had a dog biscuit for you, buddy.
WIL00000772	Pant, pant, pant.
WIL00000773	Whine!
WIL00000774	Would you like a dog biscuit, boy?
WIL00000775	Stupid mutt, you don't know what I'm saying, do you?
WIL00000776	growl...
WIL00000777	Good morning.
WIL00000778	Oh, there's nothing better than a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed.
WIL00000779	I could use some coffee.
WIL00000780	Do you have it?  Will you give it to me?
WIL00000781	Sure.
WIL00000782	You know that girl, Jessica, the Bright Follower? The one that waits to see you everyday?
WIL00000783	Sure.
WIL00000784	She's madly in love with you and wants to run away with you.
WIL00000785	Yeah, I know.
WIL00000786	You might want to consider asking her to go away with you.  I think she likes you.
WIL00000787	I suppose.
WIL00000788	She does! And she's so pretty. She's got that great smile and that hair! You should go for it.
WIL00000789	You're right. I should.
WIL00000790	So are you going to take her with you when you go?
WIL00000791	Yeah.
WIL00000792	I hear you're looking for a man named Jefferson.
WIL00000793	Yeah.
WIL00000794	But it's pretty certain he's dead, right?  So you must have a pretty good reason for staying here.
WIL00000795	Willow told me you wouldn't say much.  She was right.
WIL00000796	But, he's dead.  You're wasting your time. Are you going to keep standing here hoping he'll show up?
WIL00000797	Yeah, I am.  What of it?
WIL00000798	I saw the note. You must be desperate for the money to keep hanging around like this.
WIL00000799	Yeah.
WIL00000800	No, I wasn't wondering that. He would have been asking about ghoul activity in the area.
WIL00000801	Oh, that.  Lately there's been talk of ghouls just a bit west of Novac up in the mountains.
WIL00000802	Has a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat been in here asking questions?
WIL00000803	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs if that's what you're wondering.
WIL00000804	Did a big, tall ghoul in a cowboy hat come in asking about the ghouls up at REPCONN?
WIL00000805	Sure.
WIL00000806	Did a ghoul in a cowboy hat with a feather come and ask you some questions?
WIL00000807	Who sent you? I ain't talking. They tried to get me to talk before, but I didn't say nothing, and don't aim to now, by gum.
WIL00000808	I know I shouldn't scavenge here, but I'm not promising anything.  If I see something good I might have to sneak it out with me.
WIL00000809	*sings with no words*
WIL00000810	Hi, J.T. How ya doing, ya good dog?
WIL00000811	Pant, pant, pant
WIL00000812	Bark, bark!
WIL00000813	Alright.
WIL00000814	[Lie] She says the Bright Followers want you to leave here.  Now.
WIL00000815	I see.
WIL00000816	Leave.  It would be the best thing for everyone involved.
WIL00000817	Are you kidding me?
WIL00000818	They don't want you here. She doesn't want you here.
WIL00000819	I see.
WIL00000820	What is with you? Just give it up already. Jefferson's dead.
WIL00000821	You're probably right.
WIL00000822	Are you telling me you won't go? She's asked me to take care of you if you won't agree to leave.
WIL00000823	I won't.
WIL00000824	I think it's time for me to do something about you since you are being so uncooperative.
WIL00000825	Eat this.
WIL00000826	I'll give you some time to think about it.
WIL00000827	Sure.
WIL00000828	I know about the reward for taking him back, but he's dead. You're never going to see that money.
WIL00000829	Sure.
WIL00000830	You've given it your best shot. You've done everything you could. You should just leave now.
WIL00000831	You're right.  I should.
WIL00000832	I've talked to him.
WIL00000833	And?
WIL00000834	He's dead.
WIL00000835	You killed him?  Well, fuck you!
WIL00000836	He says he'll take you with him when he leaves.  Great news, huh?
WIL00000837	Thank you.
WIL00000838	Here, please, take this.  It's not much, but it's all I have.  I'd like to give it to you as a thank you for what you've done.
WIL00000839	Where are you two headed?
WIL00000840	We're headed back out to where he came from; some place in the NCR.  I hope everything turns out okay.
WIL00000841	I tried to talk him into going back to New Vegas with me or maybe settling down in the Mojave somewhere but he wasn't interested so off we go.
WIL00000842	On your bedroll.
WIL00000843	Okay.
WIL00000844	Hey.
WIL00000845	I didn't think we'd ever find you.  Do you still have Chester, my teddy bear?
WIL00000846	Yeah.
WIL00000847	That's quite an outfit you're wearing. Does that offer you much protection on the road?
WIL00000848	It's all I had when I left the Bright Followers.  It's one of the outfits I used to wear when I performed on The Strip.
WIL00000849	Besides, he likes the way I look in it and I've got him to keep me safe. What more does a girl need?
WIL00000850	What are you doing here?
WIL00000851	We're hanging out here for a little while before we move on.
WIL00000852	[Lie] He doesn't want anything to do with you. I tried to get him to change his mind. Sorry.
WIL00000853	Thanks for trying...can you leave me alone now? Just go away.
WIL00000854	Go back to sleep. Sorry I woke you up.
WIL00000855	<yawn> No problem.  See you in the morning.
WIL00000856	Come on, sleepyhead, let's go.
WIL00000857	<yawn>  I'm coming.
WIL00000858	Great!
WIL00000859	Oh, if you ever want to borrow Beauty from me, feel free, because I can use these.
WIL00000860	And, I've been thinking about it, you know, now that I'm trained to fight up close, I think I could handle a knife or a something like that.
WIL00000861	You bastards.
WIL00000862	I want a rocket souvenir too! For my collection!
WIL00000863	Can I borrow Beauty for a while, Willow?
WIL00000864	Yes, of course. Take good care of her.
WIL00000865	I would!  Thank you.
WIL00000866	Do you want Beauty back?  I'm done with her.
WIL00000867	Remember you promised to travel with me whether we found Beauty or not?
WIL00000868	I am traveling with you.
WIL00000869	I want to talk to you, again, about traveling with me, properly, without Beauty.
WIL00000870	I thought we covered this?  I am traveling with you.  What more is there to say.
WIL00000871	You still don't have Beauty and nothing's changed between us. We need to solve this.
WIL00000872	Fine. Let's solve it.
WIL00000873	No, I mean, really travel with me.  Working with me cooperatively and everything...
WIL00000874	I'm not being cooperative?
WIL00000875	You could be more cooperative. You promised you would be even if we didn't find your rifle.
WIL00000876	Are you even trying to find Beauty for me or did you just think since I agreed to come either way you wouldn't even try?
WIL00000877	I did say that, it's true.  But we haven't been looking all that long.  We can talk about this again soon.
WIL00000878	You could be more cooperative. You promised to work closely with me if we didn't find your rifle.
WIL00000879	Yes. You're fine. I just want you to know I'm looking forward to when that happens.
WIL00000880	To when what happens?
WIL00000881	To when we find Beauty and everything works really well between us.
WIL00000882	Oh, okay. Thanks.
WIL00000883	I know you don't have Beauty yet, but I'm not happy with our situation. I want more from you, now.
WIL00000884	I'm not ready to give up looking for Beauty. I think if you get what you want we won't look for her anymore. So, no. I won't.
WIL00000885	You promised me. It bothers me that you are breaking that promise.
WIL00000886	I'm sorry, but I have my reasons for acting this way. Just give me more time, okay?
WIL00000887	Can't we make this work for both of us?
WIL00000888	No, probably not.  Not unless you have Beauty behind your back and you're just playing games with me for some reason.
WIL00000889	So you have no intention of fulfilling your promise?
WIL00000890	I didn't say that. I just want to keep looking for a while longer before I commit myself to anything, that's all.
WIL00000891	I just want you to know that I understand why you are holding back right now.
WIL00000892	You do?
WIL00000893	Sure. You think if you give it all up right away I won't look for Beauty.  So, don't worry.
WIL00000894	Thanks.
WIL00000895	Something has to change. I'm very unhappy with this arrangement.
WIL00000896	I want to find Beauty, and, I want to find her more than I care about breaking my promise to you. Sorry.
WIL00000897	I'm not going to change the way things are without my rifle.  You can say what you like about me and my integrity.
WIL00000898	Okay, okay. We'll go find Beauty.
WIL00000899	We will?  You mean it? I didn't mean to lie when you first found me. I really meant what I said.
WIL00000900	I'm sorry if I've been terrible to you.
WIL00000901	Liar. I'm done with you. Go back to the Mojave Outpost and find somebody else to travel with.
WIL00000902	Fine. I will.
WIL00000903	Are you happy with the way things are between us?
WIL00000904	No, I'm not happy.  But I'm more unhappy that I don't have Beauty.
WIL00000905	You've mentioned that you have a collection. What do you collect?
WIL00000906	When I scavenge for stuff to sell I look for special little things that I might like to keep.  I have a collection of those things.
WIL00000907	I haven't shown them to you because, well, a girl likes to have some privacy, and besides, not everyone I've traveled with has understood.
WIL00000908	Can I ask you some personal questions?
WIL00000909	Sure, I don't mind.
WIL00000910	Why were you alone when I found you?
WIL00000911	I hadn't been in the Mojave long. I'd arrived at the Mojave Outpost a few days before and had already split up with my last travel companion.
WIL00000912	I tried to find a new companion but couldn't, so I packed up and headed out. It was very unlucky that I got into trouble.
WIL00000913	I've been on the road for almost two years now and that was about as bad as it's ever gotten for me.
WIL00000914	Although, I did lose my dog, Big George, on the trip. He was killed by geckos. That was my worst day.
WIL00000915	What got you interested in traveling?
WIL00000916	I grew up in Oregon. My family runs a motel that lots of caravans and sometimes travelers come through.
WIL00000917	So, I spent my childhood listening to stories of life on the road. I can't remember a time when I didn't want to leave and live out those stories.
WIL00000918	Are you from the Mojave?  Will you be able to fill me in on details as we travel around or are you a newcomer like me?
WIL00000919	How do you support yourself on the road?
WIL00000920	I learned a lot about trading and bargaining from the caravans and traders that stayed with us while I was growing up.
WIL00000921	I scavenge things of value as I go and when I meet someone to trade with I bargain for the best prices I can get. I do pretty well that way.
WIL00000922	What haven't they understood?
WIL00000923	That it's fun to find pretty or interesting things and keep them and a couple of the people I've traveled with have made fun of me for it.
WIL00000924	I don't collect anything, but why would I make fun of you for doing it?
WIL00000925	You don't keep anything? You don't even keep things like the glasses your favorite grandmother wore?
WIL00000926	Or maybe the outfit you wore during a significant event, or a cigarette lighter that somebody gave you?  Nothing?
WIL00000927	I like to collect things too.
WIL00000928	I'm so excited you collect stuff too. What's your favorite thing to collect?
WIL00000929	No, I just pick up stuff to sell.
WIL00000930	Hmm. Interesting.
WIL00000931	You have a collection of junk that you haul around with you?  What's the point?
WIL00000932	Great. Forget I said anything.
WIL00000933	Armor and weapons.
WIL00000934	I have some good stuff at home.  I don't pick those up on the road. They weigh too much.
WIL00000935	Teddy Bears and Toys.
WIL00000936	Oh, so you collect toys like I do.
WIL00000937	Miscellaneous Items.  You know, your basic junk.
WIL00000938	Junk?  I love junk. I have a spork in my collection and I love coffee mugs. I have to keep myself from picking them up.
WIL00000939	Things I think are special. If an item catches my eye and it interests me I'll keep it.
WIL00000940	Those are my favorites too.
WIL00000941	Now that you've asked me to pick I favorite I can't. I think I like to collect everything.
WIL00000942	That's funny. It must be hard for you to not get overloaded most of the time.
WIL00000943	Willow, now that we're friends, are you willing to change your clothes?
WIL00000944	What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
WIL00000945	Here's a Nuka-Cola for you.
WIL00000946	Thank you.
WIL00000947	No, I didn't get one.
WIL00000948	Okay, maybe next time.
WIL00000949	Can I see your collection again?
WIL00000950	Sure.
WIL00000951	I don't like the legion sitting here in Nelson.  It's too close to Novac.
WIL00000952	With the legion out of here, Novac should be safer, right?
WIL00000953	Is there any way to save the troopers? I felt terrible when we couldn't help the people in Nipton.
WIL00000954	Is there any way to save the troopers?
WIL00000955	Boone, I agree with you.  I want to save them too.
WIL00000956	Willow and I are traveling together and we've tracked you down to see if you have her teddy bear.
WIL00000957	Yeah.
WIL00000958	That was nice of you.
WIL00000959	Well, that settles that.  Mr. House is definitely not a computer.
WIL00000960	Yes, and not too fussy either.
WIL00000961	I'm really very boring.  You'd get better stories out of a Freeside junkie.
WIL00000962	I'm sure that's not true, but, maybe you'll feel more like talking if we meet again.
WIL00000963	Yeah, a good one!  Something elegant and classy, you know?  But still stylish.
WIL00000964	Sure, ya.
WIL00000965	Why does everyone always say that?
WIL00000966	Ya think?
WIL00000967	That bad, huh?
WIL00000968	Are you planning to sleep with her?
WIL00000969	Yes. I know you don't like her, but what if I wanted to? Would you have a problem with that?
WIL00000970	Yes.  I mean no. I mean...we're just friends, but I definitely don't want to watch you having sex with her. I'm going home. I'll see you there, okay?
WIL00000971	Yes, I'd have a problem with that!  What are you gonna do?
WIL00000972	Yes. I know you don't like her, but I want to do this. Are you going to have a problem with that?
WIL00000973	Um...no?
WIL00000974	Great!
WIL00000975	No!
WIL00000976	Oh!  I'm so glad to hear you say that!
WIL00000977	Oh, don't be like that honey.  What if we took her to bed together? I think you'd enjoy it.
WIL00000978	And you'd enjoy it. You wouldn't ignore me and just pay attention to her would you?
WIL00000979	[Lady Killer] I won't ignore you, I promise. But maybe you'd ignore me some, huh?  What do you say?
WIL00000980	Alright, you sweet talker, I'll do it.  This might turn out to be fun for both of us. I hope you know I'd only ever do something like this for you.
WIL00000981	[Cherchez LF] I love you Willow, how could I possibly ignore you for another girl?  Will you do it?
WIL00000982	Alright, you sweet talker, I'll do it.  This might turn out to be fun for both of us. I hope you know I'd only ever do something like this for you.
WIL00000983	Wait.  I don't want to.  Let's get out of here together.
WIL00000984	Okay.
WIL00000985	Alright.  I'll see you at home later.
WIL00000986	Okay.
WIL00000987	Willow, it's not like we're married.  I'm free to do what I want.
WIL00000988	Fine. You're right. We're not married. I understand now how things are. I thought you loved me, but I guess I was wrong. Have fun. I'm going home.
WIL00000989	I'm sorry. I didn't think about how you'd feel. Don't leave. I'll come with you.
WIL00000990	Oh!  I'm so glad to hear you say that!
WIL00000991	I want my freedom. I'm going to sleep with her. If you don't like it you should go home.
WIL00000992	Fine, I'm going home.
WIL00000993	Sarah wants to have sex with you!
WIL00000994	I think the NCR might be upset about a dead ambassador.
WIL00000995	Because it's true?
WIL00000996	We made it!
WIL00000997	That dam holds a lot of water.  More than I've ever seen in one place at one time.
WIL00000998	*nervous humming*
WIL00000999	singing in the shower
WIL00001000	Hi! How are you today?
WIL00001001	Hi!
WIL00001002	Did you say something about Star Bottle Caps?
WIL00001003	Yeah, Star Bottle Caps.  Do you believe in the treasure? I do and I think it's out there waiting for someone to find it.
WIL00001004	No, I don't think it's out there waiting to be found.  I think it's just a story.
WIL00001005	Really? But it could be something exciting that hasn't been seen since before The Great War.  I can't even imagine what that might be.
WIL00001006	Aren't you even a little curious?
WIL00001007	I don't know if it exists or not, but we can look for it together if you want.
WIL00001008	Woo-hoo!  We are huntin' for treasure!
WIL00001009	[Lie] I don't have her.  I really don't.
WIL00001010	And, since you don't have her, we'll keep looking for her then, right? And I want to keep looking for Chester too. I've had him since I was little.
WIL00001011	Alright, yes, I do have Moira.  You can have her.
WIL00001012	We're moving! This is our new house.  I thought it was time for a change.
WIL00001013	Sure, no problem.
WIL00001014	We're moving! This is our new house.  I thought it was time for a change.
WIL00001015	That's great news! I love the bungalow!
WIL00001016	It reminds me of home so much. I know I'll be very happy here.
WIL00001017	That's great news! I love the bungalow!
WIL00001018	Oh? I'll miss the bungalow. Is this a permanent move or will we go back to the bungalow someday?
WIL00001019	We're moving! This is our new house.  I thought it was time for a change.
WIL00001020	Yes, let's do that.
WIL00001021	Okay, I'll set it up right here.  You might want to back up a bit.
WIL00001022	Why don't you grab something you can eat while we're on the move. I don't want to stop right now.
WIL00001023	Alright.  I can do that.  Maybe we can do the big thing later?
WIL00001024	But, I don't have my favorite snack right now.  I guess I can make do or wait.
WIL00001025	Can you set up a campfire right here?  This is a good spot, don't you think?
WIL00001026	Yes, it's a great spot. I'll set it up right now. You might want to back up a bit.
WIL00001027	When I draw my weapon, draw yours, okay?
WIL00001028	Sure, no problem.
WIL00001029	Okay.
WIL00001030	You can stop taking your weapon out when I do.
WIL00001031	It's gorgeous here!  This may be the most beautiful place I've seen. In all my time on the road.
WIL00001032	These guys look tough...really tough.
WIL00001033	Just so you know, I plan to scavenge while we're here so don't give me away if you see me go for something.  Okay?
WIL00001034	*hums*
WIL00001035	*nervous humming*
WIL00001036	Legion and their slaves...this place gives me the creeps.  They have slave pens here.  Cages...for people!  Ugh!
WIL00001037	*hums*
WIL00001038	You loved me so, but let me go. Now I'll never know how our love will grow.
WIL00001039	Do you get homesick when you go into an NCR held location?  I sure do.
WIL00001040	Do you think we'll run into anyone you know while we're here?
WIL00001041	I was so glad to see the NCR troopers when I first got here.  I felt right at home.
WIL00001042	I was trying to figure out how they built those two giant statues. I can't even imagine how they did it.
WIL00001043	The view up here?  It's gorgeous!
WIL00001044	I know I shouldn't scavenge here, but I'm not promising anything.  If I see something good I might have to sneak it out with me.
WIL00001045	*hums*
WIL00001046	Waiting, watching the stars above. Hoping that I could win back your love.
WIL00001047	I don't think he likes me.
WIL00001048	You've got my back, right, if he tries anything?
WIL00001049	Hmpf.
WIL00001050	I hope your hungry.  I've made us something to eat and I've set the table.
WIL00001051	This place is horrible.  How can the NCR treat its troop like this?
WIL00001052	Hmpf.
WIL00001053	It's so depressing here.
WIL00001054	I'll keep my hands to myself while we're here.  Even if there was anything good to pick up, I couldn't do it.  They need everything they've got.
WIL00001055	I'm glad we're helping out around here.  This is one of the saddest places I've been.  The NCR has really let these guys down.
WIL00001056	I can't believe anyone would be so low that they'd steal medical supplies from the other troops here.
WIL00001057	I would so love to add a Dinky souvenir to my collection.
WIL00001058	I would so love to add a Dinky souvenir to my collection.
WIL00001059	Ooh, thanks!  That is a quality collectible.  I am stashing that somewhere safe.
WIL00001060	I have a Dinky the Dinosaur for you!
WIL00001061	Good news, Willow! I have one for you...
WIL00001062	Ooh, thanks!  That is a quality collectible.  I am stashing that somewhere safe.
WIL00001063	No, not really.  I won't stop you looking for it, but I'm not going to help either.
WIL00001064	Oh, well, be that way. I'm going to keep looking for it.
WIL00001065	Well, okay, maybe a little.  What if we look for it together?
WIL00001066	Yes, let's do that.
WIL00001067	Great!  I'd love to have a Nuka Cola.
WIL00001068	Great!  I could use a drink, but I don't want Nuka Cola, I want...whiskey!
WIL00001069	Great idea.
WIL00001070	I'll have my usual...whiskey.
WIL00001071	No, we don't have time right now.
WIL00001072	Okay, maybe next time.
WIL00001073	How about you sleep here?
WIL00001074	Okay, where exactly?
WIL00001075	We're here!  I'm so excited. This is the first time I've been to a trader since I was at the Mojave Outpost.
WIL00001076	You know, I keep magazines with me wherever I go. I have ones about trading or negotiating. You might find the ones about trading helpful.
WIL00001077	I don't read them much.  I mostly study the negotiating ones.  Here, you can have one of the trading ones.
WIL00001078	I should probably just sell the trading ones I have, since I don't read them, but I keep thinking I will and then I don't. Ya, know?
WIL00001079	This is the last one!  I've been trying to decide how to thank you for taking me to all the traders.
WIL00001080	I think it would be great if you could have a hat like mine.  You know, it brings me good luck with traders.
WIL00001081	I never have to bargain very hard to get great deals, it's really no work at all. It's my hat.
WIL00001082	Would you mind cooking something for me? (you use campfire crafting menu in dialogue)
WIL00001083	No, not at all. As long as you have the ingredients I can make whatever's on the menu.
WIL00001084	Let's do it. You have what you need, right?
WIL00001085	Would you mind cooking something for me? (you use campfire crafting menu in dialogue)
WIL00001086	Okay, I'm ready. May I see the menu?
WIL00001087	Yeah. I just need a minute to get my stuff together.  Hold on.
WIL00001088	I don't have everything I need, but I'll come back.
WIL00001089	Great.
WIL00001090	Do you want to talk about Mr. House?
WIL00001091	Yeah, what did you think? I don't like him. How do we even know he's human?
WIL00001092	What is going on with you and Red Lucy?
WIL00001093	I don't know what you mean.
WIL00001094	This bed seems like a good choice.
WIL00001095	Great. It looks good to me.
WIL00001096	Great. It looks good to me.
WIL00001097	Are you sending me off to bed alone?
WIL00001098	Here, in this bed. You can change into your nightwear, as well, if you'd like.
WIL00001099	Do you want to talk about Caesar?
WIL00001100	Yeah. I want to know what you think about him.
WIL00001101	No, I'm not really interested in putting any time into the bungalow.
WIL00001102	Oh, okay.
WIL00001103	The bungalow?  What about it?
WIL00001104	I love it, don't get me wrong, but it could use some improvements, don't you think?
WIL00001105	We could go collect some plants and transplant them into the planters.  Maybe go find a mailbox and put it by the door?
WIL00001106	Ooh, and maybe we could keep our eyes open for something special to put outside.  Are you interested?
WIL00001107	The legion wants to see you?  That's serious business. We need to be careful.
WIL00001108	The Ambassador, huh.  Think maybe we should go talk to him?
WIL00001109	Here's a Whiskey for you.
WIL00001110	Thank you.
WIL00001111	Lucky you!  I've never found a robot in a closet who offered to help me take over the world!
WIL00001112	That has got to be a wig!
WIL00001113	I've cooked something on the campfire if you want to share.
WIL00001114	Ugh.  Do I really have to wear this?
WIL00001115	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001116	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001117	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001118	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001119	blah
WIL00001120	blah
WIL00001121	That was fabulous!
WIL00001122	Are we going to celebrate? Do I get a present or something special from you?
WIL00001123	Yes, you do. So the first present is I made you a sweetroll to celebrate. But I'd also like to do something for you from now on as your friend.
WIL00001124	I can cook you for, you know?  Anything you want. You'll need to bring the ingredients, but I'll do the rest.  What do you think?
WIL00001125	You have some strong opinions about the Legion considering you just got here. Want to tell me why?
WIL00001126	You want the short answer to that or the story-of-my-life answer?
WIL00001127	Definitely the story of your life.
WIL00001128	Okay, so, I grew up in the motel that my parents run, right?  Well, my dad loves the guests.
WIL00001129	He sits around the fire at night with the caravaners and asks them for news from along their routes. He's always done it since I was a little girl.
WIL00001130	My mom and oldest brother, Val, they love it too and the three of them and the guests will sit up late into the night talking.
WIL00001131	And arguing.  They love to argue about the NCR and what it does or doesn't do and whether the legion is evil or not.
WIL00001132	They'll talk and argue about just about anything, but their favorite subject is politics.
WIL00001133	Did you ever get involved?
WIL00001134	I was there, but I didn't say too much. I just wanted to be close to my dad. As I got older I helped my mom more and more and saw him less and less.
WIL00001135	So if I wanted to be with my dad I'd have to grab time with him at night when he was with the guests.  I fell asleep more often than not.
WIL00001136	But, you know, I was awake often enough to learn that Caesar leads a group of brutal, killing slavers.
WIL00001137	I want the short version.
WIL00001138	My dad.  He and the caravaners would talk about news from along their routes and I heard what they said.
WIL00001139	They'd talk about Caesar and the legion so I've heard enough about them to know I don't trust them and I know they're brutal, murdering slavers.
WIL00001140	It seems like almost every time we go in there you say something snide about her.
WIL00001141	She's interested in you, I know it!  And I don't like her...at all!
WIL00001142	I don't really like what you're wearing and want you to wear something else.
WIL00001143	Oh, yeah?  Well, I like it. This jacket means a lot to me and I'm going to keep wearing it. For now anyway.
WIL00001144	Nothing, I just want to see you naked.
WIL00001145	What?  Did you really just say that to me? Go find a picture of a naked girl to look at. I'm not taking my clothes off for you.
WIL00001146	Please?
WIL00001147	Eh, maybe someday.  Not today.
WIL00001148	Nevermind
WIL00001149	Oh, okay.
WIL00001150	Wow!
WIL00001151	Of course he's human! Mr. House isn't just a man.  He's a great man.
WIL00001152	Alright, even if he is, he seems awfully full of himself.
WIL00001153	He's interesting that's for sure.
WIL00001154	It'd be interesting to know if he's human or not.
WIL00001155	We don't.  And without seeing him we can't be sure.
WIL00001156	Hmm.  Maybe we can do something about that.
WIL00001157	He's rich and powerful and he's been running things for a long time.
WIL00001158	So? Because he has a lot of money he gets to tell people how to live?  That doesn't seem fair.
WIL00001159	It's more than that. He's smart and he cares about New Vegas.
WIL00001160	He seems kind of like a bully to me.
WIL00001161	Willow!  I respect Mr. House!
WIL00001162	Sorry.
WIL00001163	No, not a bully.  He's more like a father who wants to protect and care for New Vegas.
WIL00001164	Oh! When you explain it like that he doesn't seem so bad.
WIL00001165	It's okay, but he's not a bully.
WIL00001166	So if he's not a bully, what's he doing?
WIL00001167	He's trying to keep New Vegas safe and functional. He has its best interests at heart.
WIL00001168	Okay, I'll take your word for it.  But he's not my favorite guy.
WIL00001169	Be respectful. He's earned it.  He planned ahead and protected New Vegas and is still protecting it.
WIL00001170	Okay, sorry.  He's smart.  But he's only one guy trying to tell everyone else what to do. So, why isn't he a bully?
WIL00001171	Because he has the best interests of New Vegas at heart.  This is his home.
WIL00001172	I think he's human, Willow.
WIL00001173	Maybe.  I do like his casino.  Maybe we can avoid HIM in the future.
WIL00001174	I don't plan to have much to do with him so we don't need to worry about it.
WIL00001175	Good.  That settles that.
WIL00001176	Nothing.  I'm not going to do anything. You should trust me.
WIL00001177	I'm sorry honey, I'll try.  It's hard not to be jealous you're just so wonderful I think everyone wants you as much as I do.
WIL00001178	I liked him.
WIL00001179	Seriously?  Huh.
WIL00001180	I like what he has to say.
WIL00001181	But, he's a killer, no better than a raider...worse.  He and the legion wipe out entire tribes.  They torture and maim.  They're slavers.
WIL00001182	But he's a killer. And look at how he treats women!  Do you honestly think you're different from the others?
WIL00001183	But he has reasons for why he does the things he does. I admire him.
WIL00001184	Wow.  So you are seriously considering getting involved in this war.  Against the NCR.
WIL00001185	Yes, I'm seriously considering it and I want you to stay with me even if I decide to do that.
WIL00001186	What?  Why would I want to do that?
WIL00001187	[LadyKiller]Because, we're destined to be together.  You've known it since you first saw me, Willow.
WIL00001188	You're right...I can't leave you.
WIL00001189	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001190	[BFF]Would you really walk out on your best friend?  I mean more to you than the NCR, don't I?
WIL00001191	Yes, of course you do! You're right. I'll stay with you no matter what.
WIL00001192	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001193	[Romanced]Do you really want to fight over politics? We mean more to each other than that, don't we?
WIL00001194	Oh!  You're right!  I love you! I'd die for you.
WIL00001195	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001196	So, I'm carrying this legion stuff to be helpful, right?  You're not gonna make me wear it, are you?
WIL00001197	<Yawn> I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
WIL00001198	Ugh.  I hate him.
WIL00001199	Hi!
WIL00001200	Hey, big fella, how ya doin?
WIL00001201	Hi, how ya doin?
WIL00001202	I didn't cook anything.  We don't have what I need.
WIL00001203	Sloan? Ah! This is where the Deathclaws are! We should leave. Now!
WIL00001204	Have you noticed that no one's talking about you killing all those fiends?  Isn't that weird?  Should we tell someone about it?
WIL00001205	I can't understand a thing Mean Sonofabitch says.
WIL00001206	They sure are worried about the Fiends around here.
WIL00001207	They're farmers!  Maybe we could get some fresh vegetables from them.
WIL00001208	Can we go shopping sometime soon?
WIL00001209	If we're going shopping, I'm gonna need some caps.
WIL00001210	Blue moon you saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.
WIL00001211	*sings with no words*
WIL00001212	*hums*
WIL00001213	This place is a dump.
WIL00001214	Ick, rats!
WIL00001215	We're so close, can we go to The Strip?
WIL00001216	Is it just me, or does it seem like we're always getting into situations like this?
WIL00001217	Maybe we could go to the Wrangler sometime.
WIL00001218	I like The King.  Maybe he should run things in The Mojave.
WIL00001219	Sounds like I'm not the only one who's happy you took care of Caesar.
WIL00001220	I bet Rex would like to go see The King while we're here.
WIL00001221	*hums*
WIL00001222	*sings with no words*
WIL00001223	You loved me so, but let me go. Now I'll never know how our love will grow.
WIL00001224	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.
WIL00001225	That was just what I needed.
WIL00001226	Hmm, that was good.
WIL00001227	Hope you're hungry, the food's all done.  I put it in the oven.
WIL00001228	Hi!
WIL00001229	Hi, how are you today?
WIL00001230	This place is pretty special.  It deserves a special name. I'm gonna call it Boomtown from now on.
WIL00001231	How much are we going to have to do for them? To get them to trust us I mean.  Pfft.  Probably a lot.
WIL00001232	I'm a walk walkin' and I'm walkin' some more, I'm walk walkin' and I'm walkin' some more cuz this place is enormous.
WIL00001233	The mural they have about their history, it's pretty, but I think I'll pass on the story next time.  It's hot in those little huts.
WIL00001234	Exploding ants!  We can't miss that!
WIL00001235	I know I shouldn't scavenge here, but I'm not promising anything.  If I see something good I might have to sneak it out with me.
WIL00001236	Raising an airplane off the bottom of a lake seems like a big job! Why are we the ones that always end up doing this stuff?
WIL00001237	You know, guys.  I've only ever heard about what the legion does to towns. This is horrifying.
WIL00001238	I've only ever heard about what the legion does to towns. This is horrifying.
WIL00001239	We should go tell Ghost at the Mojave Outpost about this.
WIL00001240	*nervous humming*
WIL00001241	You know, I don't think I'll ever forget this place.
WIL00001242	I know!  I've seen them!
WIL00001243	Thanks, I'll be careful.
WIL00001244	Hi, NoBark, how ya doin?
WIL00001245	blah
WIL00001246	You have a lot of food with you.  Do you cook for yourself?
WIL00001247	Yes!  I really enjoy doing it too.  I can set up a campfire anytime.  Just ask.  I'll want to cook regularly to keep up my supply of food.
WIL00001248	Do you cook?
WIL00001249	That's a difficult question to answer.
WIL00001250	Why's that?  It's seems easy enough to me.  Either you're from here and you know the Mojave or you're not and you don't, right?
WIL00001251	Like I said, it's difficult to explain, Willow.  I took a shot to the head doing my job.
WIL00001252	That's terrible.  Who shot you?  Was it an accident?
WIL00001253	No, it wasn't an accident.  He shot me, buried me and left me for dead.
WIL00001254	But, why?  That's so cruel.
WIL00001255	I was a courier and he wanted what I was carrying.  It was robbery.
WIL00001256	So, how did you survive a shot to the head that damaged you so badly?
WIL00001257	It happened in Goodsprings and the doc there patched me up.
WIL00001258	Do you know who shot you?
WIL00001259	That's too bad about your dog.  I'm sorry.
WIL00001260	Thank you.  I miss him a lot.
WIL00001261	Do you want to tell me what happened to your dog?
WIL00001262	He got ahead of me on the trail and got the scent of the Geckos.  I'm not sure exactly what happened because he was ahead of me.
WIL00001263	But I heard a yelp and I came around a bend in the trail and he'd fallen off the edge of a little precipice.  The Geckos were below with him.
WIL00001264	By the time I got down to them and shot all the geckos he was dead.  He'd broken one of his legs in the fall and he couldn't defend himself.
WIL00001265	I buried him as best I could and slept there that night with him and then, the next morning, I said goodbye and left him forever.
WIL00001266	Yes, and I'm going to pay him back for what he did to me.
WIL00001267	I'll help all I can. What an asshole.  Him, not you.
WIL00001268	Yes, and he's dead.
WIL00001269	Good.
WIL00001270	Yes, but I don't want to talk about it.
WIL00001271	Okay.
WIL00001272	No, I'm still trying to figure that out. You'll be with me while I do it.
WIL00001273	I'll help you any way I can. What an asshole thing to do to you.
WIL00001274	Do you know anything about this guy at all?
WIL00001275	No, not really.
WIL00001276	In that case can I have your scavenged food? I'll give you a list of ingredients for my favorite recipes and you'll know what I need?
WIL00001277	Oh, I guess that means I assume you scavenge. You do, don't you?  Doesn't everyone? And then, if we set up a campfire I'll be able to cook my food.
WIL00001278	Sure, I could do that.
WIL00001279	Great. Here's the list of ingredients. I'll be happy to share the food I cook with you.
WIL00001280	No, I don't want to do that.  Why can't you scavenge your own ingredients?
WIL00001281	Well, I can do that, I suppose.  I don't know how much I'll be able to find following you around. There is an advantage to you sharing though.
WIL00001282	I'll share what I cook with you, if you want it.
WIL00001283	Alright. I'll do it.  If I find ingredients you want I'll give them to you.
WIL00001284	Great. Here's the list of ingredients. I'll be happy to share the food I cook with you.
WIL00001285	No, I am not interested in doing that Willow.
WIL00001286	Oh, fine.
WIL00001287	What will you do while you're following me and don't have much freedom to scavenge?
WIL00001288	I've done different things in the past with different companions.  With people who like to stay close together I expect to find less stuff.
WIL00001289	While I'm with you I'll keep my eyes on the ground and look for caps, small things we can sell or cooking ingredients.
WIL00001290	If I'm lucky I might find a small, special item here or there to add to my collection.
WIL00001291	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001292	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001293	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001294	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001295	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001296	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001297	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL00001298	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL00001299	Can I ask you about something else?
WIL00001300	Okay.
WIL00001301	Did you say something about trading?
WIL00001302	I'd like to do some trading. Do you think we could do that?
WIL00001303	Sure, where do you want to go?
WIL00001304	When I was at the Mojave Outpost I talked to Major Knight about where I should go.  He game me three names.
WIL00001305	No, I don't want to take you shopping.  That sounds very boring to me.
WIL00001306	Even if it means I'm cooking more food to share with you?
WIL00001307	Yes, even then.
WIL00001308	Okay, it's your choice.
WIL00001309	Oh, well, when you put it like that I should say yes. Who do you want to go and see?
WIL00001310	Okay.
WIL00001311	Great!  It has been too long since I've been to a trader.
WIL00001312	Thank you, Willow, that's very sweet.
WIL00001313	Oh, good.  It'll be fun.
WIL00001314	Thank you. I like you too, Willow. I'm glad we're friends.
WIL00001315	Maybe, one day, we'll be more than friends.
WIL00001316	Okay.  Great.  I might take you up on that sometime.
WIL00001317	Oh, okay.  I hope you decide to do it.
WIL00001318	Um, the...the crosses.  Should we help those people?
WIL00001319	I thought you wanted to go shopping.  What's going on?
WIL00001320	Can I borrow 20 caps? I can't go shopping. I'm broke.
WIL00001321	I have some gecko meat for you.  I know you like to cook with it.
WIL00001322	Thank you! How many do you have for me?
WIL00001323	Thank you! How many do you have for me?
WIL00001324	I have some gecko meat for you.
WIL00001325	Yes!  And I love having all the meat, but the best part is it feels like you've been avenging Big George's death.
WIL00001326	I've found a couple of things that I'd like you to have as a thank you for what you've done. Here.
WIL00001327	Do you think I've finally brought you enough gecko meat?
WIL00001328	Thank you! How many do you have for me?
WIL00001329	I have some gecko meat for you.
WIL00001330	Yes, I do.  I'm glad to hear you can build us a campfire.
WIL00001331	That'll be fun. We can cook together over my campfire.  If I have the ingredients I cook something whenever I set it up.
WIL00001332	Do you want to see what I use the most?  Those are the ingredients I use for my favorite recipes. Maybe we could trade stuff we don't use.
WIL00001333	Would you be willing to do that? I'm happy to give you things that I don't use. Would you do the same for me?
WIL00001334	Sometimes.  It's not something I go out of my way to do.
WIL00001335	Oh, that's too bad.  I like it so much I cook something whenever I have the ingredients and can set up my campfire.
WIL00001336	Since you don't like it too much, what if I gave you my list of ingredients?
WIL00001337	Maybe, when you're scavenging, if you find some of them, you could give them to me, instead of doing something else with them. What do you say?
WIL00001338	I'd be interested in buying J.T. from you for 250 caps if you'd be willing to discuss it.
WIL00001339	Sure.
WIL00001340	Would he follow me and obey my commands?
WIL00001341	Sure.
WIL00001342	Let me take him, huh? He knows Willow and she likes him.  He'll be happy with us.
WIL00001343	Alright.
WIL00001344	Alright.
WIL00001345	I don't have the money with me.  I'll have to come back to pay you.
WIL00001346	I know about Jefferson and the bounty you've lost.  You can use the money. Let me have him.
WIL00001347	Alright.
WIL00001348	Alright.
WIL00001349	I don't have the money with me.  I'll have to come back to pay you.
WIL00001350	You have Jessica now, you don't need J.T. any more, right? Let me take him.
WIL00001351	Alright.
WIL00001352	Alright.
WIL00001353	I have to return to pay you.  I don't have the caps with me.
WIL00001354	I have the money with me to pay for J.T.
WIL00001355	Alright.
WIL00001356	Willow, I have a present for you.
WIL00001357	You do? A present? I love presents!
WIL00001358	A present? What is it?
WIL00001359	Oh, no, I didn't.  I'd like it if we could be more than friends one day. (Romance Quest)
WIL00001360	I'm not ready to take that step yet, let's just see how things go.
WIL00001361	I'm flattered, Willow, but I'd like to stay friends with you. (Be friends with Willow. No Romance.)
WIL00001362	Okay.  I'll be sure to save all my affection for special occasions.
WIL00001363	smooch.  That's a big hug and a kiss thank you.
WIL00001364	Wait!  I have a question.  Are you planning to kill those officers for that Legion guy?
WIL00001365	Forget it.  I don't want to do this afterall.
WIL00001366	Later
WIL00001367	No. I don't have either of them.
WIL00001368	They didn't have them?  Are you sure?
WIL00001369	Hey, I need that!  I use it all the time. There are some loose pages you can read if you want, but hands off the book, okay?
WIL00001370	Give me that back!
WIL00001371	You are such a tease!
WIL00001372	I took your Cooking Supplies.  Sorry.
WIL00001373	Hey!  I need that! It's going to be difficult for me to do any cooking without it.
WIL00001374	Are you teasing me?
WIL00001375	Yeah, I have your Cooking Supplies again.  Sorry.
WIL00001376	You wanted some coffee?  I have one to share. Do you want it?
WIL00001377	Oh, it's coffee! Thank you.
WIL00001378	Coffee?  Oh, thanks!
WIL00001379	I want to talk to you about your singing.
WIL00001380	Oh, you hate it don't you?  I know, I'm a terrible singer. I do it to pass the time.  It keeps me occupied. It's fun.
WIL00001381	Oh, do you have a request?
WIL00001382	I want to talk to you about your singing.
WIL00001383	Why?
WIL00001384	I want to talk to you about your singing.
WIL00001385	Here, they're colored pencils.  I thought you might like them to use in your journal.
WIL00001386	They're amazing!  Thank you so much!
WIL00001387	Here you go, it's a Magic 8-Ball. I think it will answer questions.
WIL00001388	Thank you so much. It's so special. I love it.
WIL00001389	You've been unusually quiet.  Everything okay?
WIL00001390	Oh, I don't know, I just haven't felt much like singing lately, that's all.
WIL00001391	Yes, that sounds like fun.  I'm happy to share with you.
WIL00001392	Great.
WIL00001393	No, I'm not too interested in sharing.  Why don't you plan to take care of your own needs.
WIL00001394	Oh, fine.
WIL00001395	Are you happy to have J.T. along with us?
WIL00001396	I am!  I missed him after The Big Guy and I split up. Thank you so much for buying him for us. I don't miss Big George as much when he's around.
WIL00001397	I have ten pieces for you!  Do I get something special for that?
WIL00001398	*laughs* I don't have anything special right now, but keep the meat coming and maybe I'll find something good, you never know!
WIL00001399	Thanks!  Hey, let's have gecko for dinner.
WIL00001400	Here's ten pieces for you!
WIL00001401	My name's &PCName;
WIL00001402	Thanks, again, for your help.
WIL00001403	I have no intention of working with him if that's what you're worried about.
WIL00001404	I'm happy to hear it, but I didn't think you would. So, what did you think of him?
WIL00001405	We work well together.  I don't want to lose you over a political difference of opinion.
WIL00001406	This is more than politics!  The legion treats women like dirt and they're slavers! They take whatever they want without consideration for anyone.
WIL00001407	I'd never feel safe is we were spending time around them.
WIL00001408	Yes, because he's impressed with what I've done.  I don't think he's lying about that.
WIL00001409	Yeah, right.  He's a lying killer! Did you see any women in charge? All I saw were female slaves!
WIL00001410	And you want me with you while you follow him? Why would I do that?
WIL00001411	Yes, I am. Deal with it.
WIL00001412	Are you telling me I have to accept Caesar and his legion if I'm going to stay with you?
WIL00001413	[CherchezLaFemme] Because we're destined to be together. You've known it since you first saw me.
WIL00001414	You're right...I, I can't leave you.
WIL00001415	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001416	Yes.  You can follow me and shut up about it or leave.
WIL00001417	I can't believe you're talking to me like this, but if you're interested in following Caesar I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
WIL00001418	Look, I have no intention of shutting up about this.  We can talk about it or I'm going to leave.  Choose now.
WIL00001419	Leave then.  (Willow leaves your game forever; good riddance)
WIL00001420	Alright.  Fuck you.  I am leaving and we are never, ever, ever getting back together.
WIL00001421	Leave then.
WIL00001422	<kiss> I'm glad you found me that day.
WIL00001423	Alright, calm down. Let's talk about this. (negotiations commence; Willow will stay with you)
WIL00001424	Okay, but why do I want to get involved in this war, and why on the side of the legion?
WIL00001425	I'm not going to work with him, but he was much more reasonable than I expected him to be.
WIL00001426	Yeah, right?  I expected him to be a slobbering, yelling maniac, but he wasn't so bad.
WIL00001427	Don't get me wrong, he didn't win me over.  He just wasn't as bad, or scary, as I expected him to be.
WIL00001428	He's smart and articulate.  It was interesting to talk to him.
WIL00001429	Interesting.  I didn't expect that.  Smart, yeah, but I expected you to tell me he's a raving monster.
WIL00001430	He's a bossy motherfucker, that's for sure.  I'd like to kill him.
WIL00001431	That's a great idea!  You'd be a hero!
WIL00001432	[Strength] I'll protect you. You have nothing to be afraid of while I'm with you.
WIL00001433	Alright, I'll trust you to keep me safe.
WIL00001434	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001435	[Intelligence] And the NCR doesn't "take whatever it wants without consideration for anyone?"
WIL00001436	How can you say that?  They aren't like the legion.  They don't turn people into slaves!
WIL00001437	Maybe not.  But they came into the Mojave and took what they wanted.  They weren't invited.
WIL00001438	I don't understand.  How is coming into the Mojave the same as making someone a slave?
WIL00001439	The NCR have forced themselves onto the Mojave. The Mojave didn't choose. Just like a slave doesn't.
WIL00001440	I've never heard anyone compare the NCR to slavers before.
WIL00001441	So will you stay?
WIL00001442	Yeah, let's see how it goes. I like you a lot, and I'd rather be with you than argue about politics.
WIL00001443	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001444	Yes.  I will.  I love you, and I'd rather be with you than argue about politics.
WIL00001445	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001446	Willow, stay with me because you like me.  That's more important than politics any day.
WIL00001447	You're right. I do care more about friendship than politics and I don't want to fight about it.
WIL00001448	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL00001449	I'd like to hear more about where you grew up, Willow.
WIL00001450	The trees around Jacobstown remind me of home. You already know about the caravans, but hunting's a big thing in Klamath too.
WIL00001451	I didn't mind.  It was fine.
WIL00001452	Great.
WIL00001453	Say, yes!
WIL00001454	Oh, yes! Absolutely!
WIL00001455	Oh, yes! Absolutely!
WIL00001456	Oh, not right now, honey, I'm not really in the mood.  Soon, though, I promise.
WIL00001457	You want to, don't you?
WIL00001458	Say, yes!
WIL00001459	Oh, yes! Absolutely!
WIL00001460	Oh, yes! Absolutely!
WIL00001461	Oh, not right now, honey, I'm not really in the mood.  Soon, though, I promise.
WIL00001462	You want to, don't you?
WIL00001463	This is just temporary, Willow. We'll go back.
WIL00001464	Great.
WIL00001465	Did you have fun going through my stuff? I hope so, but I need these things back.
WIL00001466	Are you teasing me?
WIL00001467	I want you to follow me again.
WIL00001468	Bark!
WIL00001469	I want you to consider this your home.
WIL00001470	Bark!
WIL00001471	Bark, bark!
WIL00001472	We're moving, J.T.  This is our new home.
WIL00001473	That's for me, isn't it?
WIL00001474	I have another present for you. I found it.
WIL00001475	I'd love to hear how much you liked it, or didn't, so come back and tell me, okay?
WIL00001476	Do you want to know how I liked my present?
WIL00001477	Yes, I do. Tell me.
WIL00001478	I loved it! Thank you. Those exploding Teddy Bears were great. Do you know how I can get more?
WIL00001479	I thought you'd like those, aren't they fun? I didn't tell you the scariest part. I made them! I thought you might not use them if I told you that.
WIL00001480	I can give you this so you can make them and I'll keep looking for the parts you'll need. Oh, and I wanted to ask you something else.
WIL00001481	Would you like to finally see my collection? I keep talking about it but I still haven't shown it to you.
WIL00001482	I didn't like it at all. Sorry.
WIL00001483	Oh, I got it that wrong.  Hmm. Well, I have something else you might like. Here.
WIL00001484	Would you like to see my collection, finally? I keep talking about it but still haven't shown it to you.
WIL00001485	You definitely chose the right kind of thing. Thank you.
WIL00001486	Oh, I'm so glad you liked it. I have something else I found that I think you might like too. Here.
WIL00001487	Would you like to see my collection, finally? I keep talking about it but still haven't shown it to you.
WIL00001488	Do you have anything better to give me?
WIL00001489	No, I don't have anything better to give you.
WIL00001490	I'm ready.
WIL00001491	Yes, Willow?  Is this about us?
WIL00001492	I'm ready.
WIL00001493	I'm ready for us to be more than just friends.
WIL00001494	Now? Now's a terrible time! But, I want to! We'll have to do it later.
WIL00001495	I'll be waiting for you.
WIL00001496	Yes! I've been waiting for you to come to me!
WIL00001497	Well, I'm here now. I have a surprise for you and would love some privacy. Should we do it here or go some place else?
WIL00001498	Let's do it here.
WIL00001499	I'm so excited. I've been planning this for awhile. I hope you like it. Stay right there and don't move.
WIL00001500	I'm going to do something for you and then to you.
WIL00001501	I want to go somewhere else.
WIL00001502	Lead the way, Lover.
WIL00001503	...
WIL00001504	I'm ready. Let's do it here.
WIL00001505	I'm so excited. I've been planning this for awhile. I hope you like it. Stay right there and don't move.
WIL00001506	I'm going to do something for you and then to you.
WIL00001507	Now that we're best friends do we have some things to talk about?
WIL00001508	Yes, absolutely!
WIL00001509	I want you to go home for awhile...
WIL00001510	It's time for us to part ways.
WIL00001511	<whine>
WIL00001512	I want you to go home and wait for me there.
WIL00001513	<whine>
WIL00001514	I want you to go to the suite at the Lucky 38 and wait for me there.
WIL00001515	<whine>
WIL00001516	No, there's nothing bad waiting for you.  No punishment.  You're a good man.  You deserve peace of mind and a good life.  That's what you deserve.
WIL00001517	Oh, no!  Bethie got killed by Geckos!
WIL00001518	No, only Big George got killed by Geckos.
WIL00001519	So, what did happen to Bethie?
WIL00001520	Yes, it's almost time to go.  Let's talk now.
WIL00001521	Are you worried at all about dying?  I'm worried about you and me too.  It's scary to think both of us might not make it through this.
WIL00001522	I have some more work to do before we'll go to The Dam, can we talk later?
WIL00001523	Okay.
WIL00001524	I'm not too worried about it. I think we have the advantage of strength on our side.
WIL00001525	I'm glad you're feeling confident about our chances, and you must feel committed to your cause to be risking your life.
WIL00001526	Of course!  It's scary as hell!  But we'll be okay.
WIL00001527	What do you mean?
WIL00001528	I want to make sure you know how I feel about you, just in case one of us doesn't make it through this.
WIL00001529	You've been a great friend to me, like the sister I never had and I love you.
WIL00001530	I want to make sure you know how I feel about you, just in case one of us doesn't make it through this.
WIL00001531	You've been a great friend to me and I love you very much.
WIL00001532	I want to make sure you know how I feel about you, just in case one of us doesn't make it through this.
WIL00001533	And?
WIL00001534	Well, when it occurred to me that you might die I got so sad!
WIL00001535	I love you so much.  I was thinking, if we both make it through this maybe we could talk about making our relationship a more serious one.
WIL00001536	Maybe we could talk about staying together forever.
WIL00001537	But for now,  I want you to take this and wear it. Maybe it'll keep you safe.
WIL00001538	Think of it as my promise to you that I'll love you forever no matter what.  Because I do and I will. I'll be wearing one too.
WIL00001539	I want to make sure you know I love you very much.  You've been a wonderful friend to me.  Thank you.
WIL00001540	I do!  Thanks for the ones you've given me so far.
WIL00001541	You're welcome!
WIL00001542	Well, you're spoiling me Willow. It's too much.
WIL00001543	Do you want me to stop?  I will if you want me to.
WIL00001544	Yeah, that would be best.  (turns gift giving in the mailbox off)
WIL00001545	Okay.
WIL00001546	No, please don't.  It's a lot, but I like it. (Willow will continue to leave gifts in the mailbox)
WIL00001547	Okay.
WIL00001548	Now that we're best friends are you willing to change your clothes?
WIL00001549	Okay, I don't know what all this fuss is about, but yes, if you're tired of seeing me in this outfit, I'm willing to change it. Happy?
WIL00001550	I have five pieces for you.
WIL00001551	Thanks.
WIL00001552	You wanted to talk after we left The Fort.  What is it?
WIL00001553	I need to know how committed you are to Caesar.
WIL00001554	We need to talk before you do anything to Caesar, but we can't talk here. Please talk to me before you do anything.
WIL00001555	Maybe we can.  Let's find whoever's in charge around here and ask.
WIL00001556	Great!  I'd like that. Things are a mess around here.
WIL00001557	All mine!
WIL00001558	What?
WIL00001559	The memorial reminded me of my brother, Chuck.  From the time he was little all he wanted to do was join the NCR and become a Ranger.
WIL00001560	My dad wouldn't let him do it, though.
WIL00001561	Why wouldn't your dad let him do it?
WIL00001562	He didn't want Chuck to die fighting for the NCR.  Dad wanted him safe at home, which it turns out he didn't get after all.
WIL00001563	Chuck's a caravan guard now. He loves it. I think he thrives on danger.
WIL00001564	He almost died a few years ago in a fight, but he has this big scar to show for it.
WIL00001565	The thing is the scar's left him dangerous looking and he knows it so he plays it up and acts tough. He's a handful, but girls love him.
WIL00001566	Heh. Willow you didn't stay home safe either!
WIL00001567	Yeah, you're right.  My dad did mention Chuck when I told him what I wanted to do.
WIL00001568	I can understand why he wanted to protect Chuck.  It'd be hard to lose a child.
WIL00001569	Yeah, and if I ever have a baby, and I want to someday, I hope he or she won't do the crazy stuff Chuck and I do.
WIL00001570	I'd worry myself sick.
WIL00001571	Your dad should have let Chuck go fight.  There's honor in fighting.
WIL00001572	Yeah? And death?  If I ever have kids, and I'd like to someday, I'd want to keep them safe too.
WIL00001573	Not my strong suit, but okay.
WIL00001574	Maybe some other time.
WIL00001575	I dunno, couldn't hurt.
WIL00001576	I'm met Carla while I was at the Strip on leave. She said I looked lost.
WIL00001577	Pointless.
WIL00001578	That's what I do best.
WIL00001579	We can do that.
WIL00001580	Yeah, I guess.
WIL00001581	No, sorry.
WIL00001582	We can do that.
WIL00001583	I've got bad things coming to me.
WIL00001584	Is there something going on between you and Boone?
WIL00001585	No, not at all. I'm just being nice to him because he's so sad and tortured.  Poor guy.
WIL00001586	Is there something going on between you and Boone?
WIL00001587	Well, I do like him a lot.  He's brave and handsome. I feel so sorry for him.  He's so tortured. I just wish I could help him.
WIL00001588	Yes, let's do it.  The bungalow could use some work.
WIL00001589	Great.
WIL00001590	Here...take this. I can't say it outloud. You're..you'll have to read it.
WIL00001591	Let's talk about something else.
WIL00001592	Oh, okay.
WIL00001593	Wow.
WIL00001594	Oh, hell.
WIL00001595	Okay, I won't.
WIL00001596	Wow.
WIL00001597	Sure, yeah.
WIL00001598	Why does everyone always say that?
WIL00001599	I'm not sure.
WIL00001600	Hmm. More or less.
WIL00001601	How could you know, right?
WIL00001602	Wow, that was wonderful. You were wonderful. I hope we can do that again sometime.
WIL00001603	Yes, you can count on it.
WIL00001604	Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
WIL00001605	Willow, I'm not interested in doing it again. I hope you understand.
WIL00001606	Fine.  We won't then. And as far as I'm concerned, we are nothing more than friends from now on, I hope you understand?
WIL00001607	Willow, I want to make love to you.
WIL00001608	Oh!
WIL00001609	What's with all the pencils? You've got about ten of them.
WIL00001610	I like pencils.
WIL00001611	You like pencils?
WIL00001612	I do write in my journal. But, have you noticed when you need one it's never there?  Well, if you have ten, or more, there's never a problem.
WIL00001613	I notice you have a lot of dog biscuits too.  Why so many of those?
WIL00001614	I love them!  I made up the recipe for Big George, my dog, but they're so tasty I carry a bunch with me all the time. They're my favorite snack.
WIL00001615	They're good, huh? Can I try one?
WIL00001616	Oh, please do.  We can always make more.
WIL00001617	Hmm. Think I'll pass on the dog's food.
WIL00001618	Why?  I cook them properly.  I make them with Gecko meat, Blamco Mac & Cheese and flour. It's not like I make them with Salisbury Steak. Ugh.
WIL00001619	Oh, well, that's alright then.
WIL00001620	Thanks.
WIL00001621	You might want to consider a name change for them.  Dog Biscuits isn't so appetizing, is it?
WIL00001622	I think I'll leave it for now.  In remembrance of Big George.
WIL00001623	It's a teddy bear. I hope you like it.
WIL00001624	I do, thanks!
WIL00001625	I found a garden gnome. Don't you think he'll go nicely with Moira and Chester?
WIL00001626	Yes, I do!  Thank you.
WIL00001627	It's a Nuka Cola Quartz.
WIL00001628	Thank you!  I'm going to drink that right away!
WIL00001629	[Change mind] Um, oops, I guess I don't have something to give you after all.  I'm sorry, Willow.
WIL00001630	Oh.  okay.
WIL00001631	Uh-oh, am I in trouble?
WIL00001632	May I please have my Lucky Figurine back? You know, I didn't show you my collection so you could ransack it.
WIL00001633	Can I keep it?  Please?  I'll take good care of it.  I promise.
WIL00001634	Yes, you know, you can have it. I got it from a trader and it's never been especially dear to me.  Maybe you'll like it more than I have.
WIL00001635	I was just curious about it.  You can have it back now. Where did you get it?
WIL00001636	I got that from a trader.  I don't find everything I have.  Moira came from a caravaner who used to stay with us in the motel, but she was a gift.
WIL00001637	Thank you.
WIL00001638	But, the lighter? I definitely want that. It was my grandfather's.
WIL00001639	Oh, there's our tent! We should camp there some night.  I'll cook us dinner.  It'd be fun.
WIL00001640	Look!  It's where you first found me! It looks so boring for such a special place.
WIL00001641	I have some to share.  Here, have one of mine.
WIL00001642	Thanks!
WIL00001643	That sounds good.  I don't want to stop right now.
WIL00001644	Okay, fine.
WIL00001645	Yes, I want you gone. (This choice removes her from your game forever in prep for removing mod)
WIL00001646	Well, goodbye.  I don't know what else to say.
WIL00001647	Maybe later.
WIL00001648	Great! I'd like that. Things are a mess around here.
WIL00001649	No, Willow, I don't want to help the NCR troops.
WIL00001650	Okay, it's up to you.
WIL00001651	Do you know exactly what you want or do you plan to just wander around? The Mojave's a big place.
WIL00001652	Oh, I know what I want and where we should go to get it.  When I was at the Mojave Outpost I picked up a NCR pamphlet.
WIL00001653	It talks about the flora and fauna of the Mojave and where to find stuff.  It's very informative.
WIL00001654	I've planned our little mission based on what I've read in the pamphlet.  Hopefully it won't send us on a wild goose chase.
WIL00001655	The first place we're headed to is Ruby Hill Mine to get a couple of Banana Yucca plants.
WIL00001656	I've got the Banana Yucca plants.  Where to now?
WIL00001657	The next place on my list is Silver Peak Mine.  It's up the road a ways.  We should find Xander Root plants there.
WIL00001658	Got the Xander Root Plants.  What's next?
WIL00001659	I've been thinking I'd like to have some Cave Fungus inside the bungalow where it'd be all glowy. The pamphlet says there's some in Charleston Cave.
WIL00001660	I've got the Cave Fungus.  Where are we headed to now?
WIL00001661	We're going after Broc Flower plants. It's quite a long way; south of a trainyard according to the pamphlet.
WIL00001662	Too bad we can't grow our own pinyon nuts, huh? That'd make life easier.
WIL00001663	Are we going to be carrying much else?  Those broc flower plants are big.
WIL00001664	Well, that's it for plants.  The last thing I want is a mailbox.  You never know, if we have one, maybe we'll get some mail!
WIL00001665	I know that probably sounds really silly.
WIL00001666	But when I was little me and my friends would leave each other notes and presents in our mailboxes.  I can't imagine having a house without one.
WIL00001667	Look at the pink bird! We have to take that, don't you think?  It would look great next to the planters!
WIL00001668	Okay, I got the pink bird for you.
WIL00001669	I think that's it!  I'm not sure we could carry much more than this.
WIL00001670	Wanna go back to the bungalow now?  We can get everything set up.
WIL00001671	Look at the cave fungus! It looks great, doesn't it?
WIL00001672	Okay, I got the pink bird for you.
WIL00001673	Is this it?  Do you think this is the treasure? Disappointing, right? Don't get me wrong, the gnome's cute, but its not what I'd hoped we'd find.
WIL00001674	But, you know, the trip doesn't have to be a total waste.
WIL00001675	If you pick up a couple of those badges and bring me some duct tape I'll turn them into something we can wear.
WIL00001676	You can do that?
WIL00001677	Sure, I stuck the flower on my hat and it's stayed there for months. So, if you're interested bring me two badges and a roll of duct tape.
WIL00001678	Here are the badges and duct tape.  Can you make us badges now?
WIL00001679	Sure! This is so easy to do I can do it right now.
WIL00001680	It'll just take me a second, so hold on.
WIL00001681	Oh, no!  J.T.!  No!  He's dead!
WIL00001682	Alright.
WIL00001683	Yeah, that's a great idea.
WIL00001684	Thank you!
WIL00001685	No, I want you to have it Willow.
WIL00001686	Okay.  Thank you!
WIL00001687	How did you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
WIL00001688	Sounds great.
WIL00001689	It will be. I promise.
WIL00001690	Two months?  That long, huh?
WIL00001691	We've been together for two months now! I got you a present to celebrate.  It's in the kitchen on the counter.
WIL00001692	Thank you, Willow.
WIL00001693	I want you to know. I love you very much. More every day.
WIL00001694	I'd really like my beret back, please.
WIL00001695	Don't worry about it, Willow. I can handle Red Lucy.
WIL00001696	Are you sure?  I don't trust her.
WIL00001697	Oh, come on Willow it'd be fun!
WIL00001698	No, I don't want to join you in a threesome with her!  What I want to do is go home.  I thought you loved me!
WIL00001699	You know there are girls here, right?  Ones you can pay for sex.  You wouldn't do that would you?
WIL00001700	You wouldn't have a problem with that would you?  It's not like we're married.
WIL00001701	Fine. You're right, we're not married. Go ahead and keep sleeping with whoever you want, you should be happy.
WIL00001702	It's just, you know, I thought we had something special.
WIL00001703	I like my freedom, Willow. You should go on home,
WIL00001704	Fine.  I'm going home.
WIL00001705	Willow, I didn't realize it was so important to you.  I don't need anyone but you. Okay?
WIL00001706	Why?
WIL00001707	Because he's evil and if the legion wins the war they'll destroy everything that's good in the Mojave. You can stop it.
WIL00001708	If you kill Caesar now you will destroy the legion.  You have to consider it.
WIL00001709	No, way!
WIL00001710	It's the best option for the Mojave. The legion will destroy everything here. You know that's the truth.
WIL00001711	Remember that chatty robot in the closet in Benny's room?  He offered to help you take over New Vegas and make it your own.
WIL00001712	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the Mojave. You'd be a hero.
WIL00001713	It's the best option for the Mojave. The legion will destroy everything here. You know that's the truth.
WIL00001714	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the Mojave. You'd be a hero.
WIL00001715	No, way!
WIL00001716	What?  Why would I do that?
WIL00001717	Killing Caesar won't destroy the legion.
WIL00001718	Okay, maybe it won't destroy it, but it will weaken it, and you can leave them, and if you must fight in this war fight it another way.
WIL00001719	Remember that chatty robot? The one in the closet in Benny's room?  He offered to help you take over New Vegas and make it your own.
WIL00001720	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the entire Mojave.   You'd be a hero.
WIL00001721	Okay, maybe it won't destroy it, but it will weaken it, and you can leave them, and if you must fight in this war fight it another way.
WIL00001722	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the entire Mojave.   You'd be a hero.
WIL00001723	Killing Caesar won't destroy the legion.
WIL00001724	Yeah, yeah, time for more fighting, I know.
WIL00001725	That's it! You've gone too far! I should tell you to leave and never come back!
WIL00001726	Oh, I'm sorry!  Don't make me go!  I love you!  I take it back!
WIL00001727	Oh, I'm sorry!  Please, don't make me go! I take it back!
WIL00001728	You've gone too far and you're going to pay the price!  (kill her)
WIL00001729	What?
WIL00001730	I'll think about it.
WIL00001731	Thank you.
WIL00001732	You're so unhappy, just go.  I do love you, but this will be better for both of us. (leaves forever)
WIL00001733	Okay. You know, I could never leave you on my own, but, you're right,  it's probably for the best.
WIL00001734	I do love you.
WIL00001735	Okay. You know, I could never leave you on my own, but, you're right,  it's probably for the best.
WIL00001736	You've been a great friend to me. I'll miss you.
WIL00001737	You're so unhappy, just go.  I do love you, but this will be better for both of us. (leaves forever)
WIL00001738	You can't take it back.  It's over.  Just go.  Now. (leaves forever)
WIL00001739	Alright, fine!  But I don't want to hear any more about killing Caesar.
WIL00001740	I promise, I won't mention it again. I'm so sorry.
WIL00001741	Here you go, the new badges are done!
WIL00001742	Let's talk about your outfits we put together in the bungalow.
WIL00001743	Okay, which one?
WIL00001744	I'd like you to change into Outfit 1.

WIL00001782	Okay.
WIL00001783	Please take off your sleepwear.
WIL00001784	I want you to change into your intimate moments things.
WIL00001785	Sure, I'd love to.
WIL00001786	Sure, take a look.
WIL00001787	I'd like to do something with your intimate moment things.
WIL00001788	Okay.
WIL00001789	Please take off your intimate moment things.
WIL00001790	I don't need any time to think about it! I'll stay with you forever if I make it through this!
WIL00001791	Ah! Oh! I love you!
WIL00001792	Thanks, Willow.  If I get through this, I'll think about what you've said.
WIL00001793	I love you.
WIL00001794	I don't want you to use your mask when we are in irradiated areas (she won't put on her mask).
WIL00001795	Okay, sure.
WIL00001796	Sure, no problem.
WIL00001797	Use your own mask when we're in irradiated areas (she'll use her mask)
WIL00001798	Stay here, please, and don't attack anything. Take cover if you can.
WIL00001799	Got it. I'll stay here.
WIL00001800	You got it.
WIL00001801	Thanks for waiting here, but I want your help now.
WIL00001802	Willow, follow me, but don't attack anything, okay?
WIL00001803	Sure, I don't need to be a hero.
WIL00001804	I want you to leave now and get to safety. Go!
WIL00001805	Okay. Stay safe!
WIL00001806	Okay, I've got your back.
WIL00001807	Let's go now. I want you back by my side.
WIL00001808	There's no place I'd rather be.
WIL00001809	Let's go now. I want you back by my side.
WIL00001810	I need you to fight again. Now!
WIL00001811	Okay. I've got your back.
WIL00001812	...
WIL00001813	Nothing, I just thought you might like to talk about your problems. Willow warned me you were quiet.
WIL00001814	Yeah.
WIL00001815	Let's talk about what you do for me when we fight together, okay?
WIL00001816	Sure.
WIL00001817	Are you trying to tell me something? You've been flirting with me for awhile now.
WIL00001818	It's true, I have been flirting.
WIL00001819	You are not making this easy for me!  You know I want you, right?
WIL00001820	Yes, I know.  I feel the same way.
WIL00001821	You must know by now how much I like you. And if you don't know, let me say it again. I do like you.
WIL00001822	You do? I'm so glad. You'd said so before, and you've done so many nice things for me, that, I'd hoped you still did. But, I wasn't sure.
WIL00001823	You do know, as soon as you give me the ok, I'm going to be all over you. And I mean, ALL over you.
WIL00001824	Oh. Maybe we should do something about that.  Soon.
WIL00001825	How soon Willow? Now? Because I want it to be now.  Come here.
WIL00001826	Soon is good, but I want you to be ready. I'll be here when you decide to come to me.
WIL00001827	I'll come to you when I'm ready, I promise.
WIL00001828	Yes, I still do like you. Will you come here and let me show you how much?
WIL00001829	Yes!  I've been thinking about this for a long, long time.
WIL00001830	And because I've been thinking about it for so long I've had time to plan something special for you.
WIL00001831	I'd like to do it somewhere private.  But, you choose. Should we do it here or go somewhere else?
WIL00001832	I do still like you, a lot, but I want you to come to me. Whenever you're ready I'll be here.
WIL00001833	I'll come to you when I'm ready, I promise.
WIL00001834	Are we going to do something about it or are you going to keep flirting forever?
WIL00001835	I'm not ready yet. When I am I'll come to you, I promise.
WIL00001836	Great. Let's do something about it. Come here and let me show you how much I want you.
WIL00001837	Let's go somewhere else. Come on.
WIL00001838	Lead the way, Lover.
WIL00001839	Will you dance for me?
WIL00001840	Yes, for you, anything.
WIL00001841	Can you skip the dance, Willow?  I don't want to wait.
WIL00001842	Of course, honey, whatever you want.
WIL00001843	Can you sing more often?
WIL00001844	Sure!  I'd love to!
WIL00001845	Sure, no problem.
WIL00001846	I'd like you to sing less often.
WIL00001847	Things are going to get tough around here, Willow, really Hardcore. Be prepared.(Set Essential)
WIL00001848	Okay.
WIL00001849	Oh...okay.
WIL00001850	Watch yourself. Things are going to get tough around here, and you could get hurt.(Set Unessential)
WIL00001851	I have a special present for you.
WIL00001852	You do?  A present! I love presents!
WIL00001853	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called A. Tom McTed.
WIL00001854	Ooh, thanks! That is a quality collectible.
WIL00001855	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Bearly.

WIL00001866	Ooh, thanks! That is a quality collectible.
WIL00001867	I'd like to rent the deluxe bungalow.
WIL00001868	Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least till the busy season comes. Sound good?
WIL00001869	Here's 150 caps.
WIL00001870	I'm glad you can stay with us.
WIL00001871	I can't afford 150 caps right now.
WIL00001872	Well that's nothing to be ashamed of. We all have money troubles from time to time.
WIL00001873	You just come on back when you can afford it, and that room's all yours.
WIL00001874	Nevermind.
WIL00001875	Oh. Well, all right.
WIL00001876	I'd like to rent the deluxe bungalow on the end.
WIL00001877	That's a great idea.
WIL00001878	Here's 150 caps.
WIL00001879	Great! Here ya go.
WIL00001880	I can't afford 150 caps right now.
WIL00001881	Need anything else?
WIL00001882	Nevermind.
WIL00001883	Need anything else?
WIL00001884	Willow, are you coming on to me?
WIL00001885	Yeah, I..yeah, I guess I am.
WIL00001886	Yeah, I want to help him every way I can.
WIL00001887	I just can't get over it. That you believe in him.
WIL00001888	I'm getting tired of you complaining about it. Why don't you leave already?
WIL00001889	Do you want me to go?
WIL00001890	Yes, forever.  (Willow leaves your game.  You can't get her back).
WIL00001891	Alright.  Fuck you.  I am leaving and we are never, ever, ever getting back together.
WIL00001892	Yes, go home. I'll catch up with you later.
WIL00001893	Alright.  I'll see you there later.
WIL00001894	No, but I could stand less complaining from you about the Legion.
WIL00001895	I'm sorry. I did tell you I wasn't thrilled about being involved with Caesar.  Don't forget I love you, okay?  It's why I'm here.
WIL00001896	No, I want you to stay with me.
WIL00001897	I want that too.
WIL00001898	Well, I do.  Follow me, follow him.  That's the way it's going to be.
WIL00001899	Okay, don't forget I love you.  That's why I stay.
WIL00001900	Yes, why?
WIL00001901	I don't want to have anything to do with that.  It's one thing to kill people who are trying to kill us, but to go in cold...
WIL00001902	I'm gonna sit this one out.  I'll be waiting for you at home.
WIL00001903	No.
WIL00001904	Oh, okay.
WIL00001905	Hunting?
WIL00001906	Yeah, geckos, mostly. That's why my dad taught me to shoot as soon as I could handle a weapon.  He was looking to train us to be hunters.
WIL00001907	He didn't really like doing all the hunting for the motel himself so he was looking for help from us kids.
WIL00001908	I didn't like hunting all the time though, I preferred hanging out and working with my mom in the motel so that was my job.
WIL00001909	Dad got his wish though, two of my brothers really took to hunting. That's Sam and Dean.
WIL00001910	What about your other brothers?
WIL00001911	Val's a doctor, Chuck's a caravan guard and my little brother, Bobby? He's probably running around still being useless most of the time.
WIL00001912	Do you ever get lonely traveling by yourself?
WIL00001913	Yes, I do, even though I'm rarely alone. I had hoped to meet someone special. Maybe someone who would want to come with me on the road.
WIL00001914	Or maybe someone would like me enough to want me stay with them. But even though I've met and traveled with a lot of people in the last two years,
WIL00001915	I have been unlucky in love and friendship.
WIL00001916	I'm sorry. I'm sure it will happen for you someday.
WIL00001917	Yeah?  I hope so.
WIL00001918	Maybe you'll get lucky sooner than you think.
WIL00001919	Yeah?  Ya, think?
WIL00001920	What? Sorry, I got distracted by something over there behind you. You were saying?
WIL00001921	Oh, nevermind. I was just rambling. It wasn't important.
WIL00001922	You're welcome.
WIL00001923	So you're serious about having me stay here in the Mojave with you?
WIL00001924	Yes, I am, very much.
WIL00001925	This means a lot to me.  Thank you.
WIL00001926	This means a lot to me.  Thank you.
WIL00001927	And I love the bungalow.  It reminds me of home so much. I know I'm going to be very happy here.
WIL00001928	Yes, I am, very much.
WIL00001929	Sure. If you want to stay that would be fine with me. I'm happy to have you share my house with me.
WIL00001930	Thank you.
WIL00001931	Thank you.
WIL00001932	And I love the bungalow.  It reminds me of home so much. I know I'm going to be very happy here.
WIL00001933	Sure. If you want to stay that would be fine with me. I'm happy to have you share my house with me.
WIL00001934	Having you here will make things easier for me while we're traveling together.
WIL00001935	Oh.  Well, thanks.
WIL00001936	Thank you.
WIL00001937	And I love the bungalow.  It reminds me of home so much. I know I'm going to be very happy here.
WIL00001938	Having you here will make things easier for me while we're traveling together.
WIL00001939	You don't seem to mind coming back here at all.  But if I'd been shot, and buried, and left for dead somewhere I don't think I'd go back.
WIL00001940	Are you going to show me where you were buried? Oh, sorry I could have said that better. I'm just really curious.
WIL00001941	I'd like to go see Chet and do some shopping while we're here.
WIL00001942	If we're gonna go see Chet, I'm gonna need to borrow some caps.
WIL00001943	Want to take me out for a drink or a bite to eat in the Saloon?  What do you say?
WIL00001944	Wanna go by the Saloon for a drink?  I bet Sunny'd like to go.
WIL00001945	This is a nice little town, but you know what it needs?  A motel.  Everything's better with a motel.
WIL00001946	Waiting, watching the stars above. Hoping that I could win back your love.
WIL00001947	*hums*
WIL00001948	I'm so blue without you, thought our love was true, then you found someone new.
WIL00001949	*sings with no words*
WIL00001950	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.
WIL00001951	He buried you in the cemetery. Ouch.
WIL00001952	I can't be the only one wondering if we're going to come out of this okay.  We could end up dead.  Or worse.
WIL00001953	Huh.  Well, if this camp is any indication, Caesar's the monster I've always heard he is.  Look at this place.
WIL00001954	Those poor girls.
WIL00001955	Can't say I like how they treat their women around here.
WIL00001956	I'm not taking anything out of here...these guys and their crosses?  I'm not messing with them.
WIL00001957	*nervous humming*
WIL00001958	Be nice to get back out on the road again.
WIL00001959	Wow!  Look at those legs! Ugh! But he's just a slaving s- I can't wait to get out of here.
WIL00001960	You know, if I ever build a fort, the first thing I'm going to put up is some crucified bodies.  They're just so...welcoming.
WIL00001961	A month?  That long, huh?
WIL00001962	Yes!  We've been together for a month now and I have a present for you to celebrate!
WIL00001963	Well, it's been a month since we sealed our friendship!  And I have a present for you to celebrate!  I hope you like it!
WIL00001964	Thank you, Willow.
WIL00001965	It's kind of corny and romantic.
WIL00001966	Hopefully you'll like it enough to wear it because I want you to think of me every time you do and remember this:
WIL00001967	You hold the key to my heart and I love you very much.
WIL00001968	Thank you, Willow.
WIL00001969	You're welcome.  I hope you like it.
WIL00001970	We're almost to the end aren't we?  I mean to the battle at The Dam.  I want to talk to you before we go.
WIL00001971	Here, it's a little toy horse.  When I saw it, I thought of you.  I hope you like it.
WIL00001972	Ah! That's amazing!  Thank you so much!
WIL00001973	I don't know if we'll go back or not, Willow.   We'll see.
WIL00001974	Oh, okay.
WIL00001975	This is for you. It's a lacey teddy bear.
WIL00001976	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00001977	Look!  It's a tiny teddy bear!
WIL00001978	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00001979	Here you go, it's a red toaster.  Do you like it?
WIL00001980	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00001981	Here, it's a bottle of perfume.  I hope you like it.
WIL00001982	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00001983	Look!  It's a giant panda bear!
WIL00001984	Ah! That's amazing!  Thank you so much!
WIL00001985	Here you go, it's the Sunset Sarsaparilla garden gnome. I want you to have it.
WIL00001986	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL00001987	[Charisma] You're my girl, Willow, I won't forget you for one moment.  Say you'll do it.
WIL00001988	Alright, you sweet talker, I'll do it.  This might turn out to be fun for both of us. I hope you know I'd only ever do something like this for you.
WIL00001989	I have a special present for you.  I think you're going to really love this!
WIL00001990	A present? What is it?
WIL00001991	I have a special present for you.  I think you're going to really love this!
WIL00001992	Sure, I'll give you some caps for that.
WIL00001993	Thanks!
WIL00001994	Sorry, Willow, not right now.
WIL00001995	Oh.  Okay.
WIL00001996	Here, this might help when you go in with him. It's up to you, but I find talking is sometimes better than whacking.
WIL00001997	This place looks exactly like I imagined it would: drunks, lights, hookers.  It's perfect.
WIL00001998	You know, New Vegas is why I came to the Mojave, I've been hearing stories about it for years.
WIL00001999	We're going to go to a casino, aren't we?
WIL00002000	The lights are gorgeous.
WIL00002001	Interested in taking me out for a drink in one the casinos?  That might be fun.
WIL00002002	Come on, let's have some fun.  What do you say?  Let's go jump in the fountain.
WIL00002003	I can't believe you stuck one of us in that freezer.  That was heartless.  I hope I don't have to worry about what you'll do to me.
WIL00002004	Hey, want to go get a drink?  I'm thirsty and Cass can always use more whiskey.
WIL00002005	Everyone's talking about you, did you notice?  Well, maybe they don't know it was you that did it, but they're talking about Mr. House.
WIL00002006	If Veronica gets a dress I want one too.  Or maybe new shoes or a new hat.  I don't know, something pretty.  Please?
WIL00002007	Hey, did you hear that?  Somebody's talking about Caesar being dead.  You're a hero, just like I told you!
WIL00002008	What do you say, Boone?  Let's have some fun while we're here.
WIL00002009	*nervous humming*
WIL00002010	Hmpf.
WIL00002011	Willow, would you consider changing your clothes?
WIL00002012	Change my clothes? Do you know I killed the geckos that were used to make my jacket? I think that makes it pretty special.
WIL00002013	I do, I'm confident the NCR can win this.
WIL00002014	You know, I was never excited about getting involved in this war, but after everything we've seen...
WIL00002015	Driving the legion out of the Mojave is the right thing to do.  If I die, doing it, it would be for something worthwhile.
WIL00002016	Yes, I want to see a Mojave free of both the Legion and the NCR.  A truly independent New Vegas.
WIL00002017	I've never been excited about getting involved in this war. But,  I'm committed to supporting you.  I'll do whatever it takes.
WIL00002018	I've never been excited about getting involved in this war. But, I'm committed to supporting you.  I'll do whatever it takes.
WIL00002019	I am committed.  I think Mr. House is the right choice for the Mojave.
WIL00002020	Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
WIL00002021	Oh, I do! I don't want to die. But I do want to talk to you about the possibility.
WIL00002022	Even against the NCR?
WIL00002023	Yeah, that is hard for me, but after everything we've seen?  I agree, they shouldn't be here.
WIL00002024	But, this isn't what I want to talk to you about.
WIL00002025	No, I haven't decided that, you don't need to worry about it. Why do you ask?
WIL00002026	Well, I'm from the NCR!  I don't want to be shooting them and I don't want them to be shooting at me!
WIL00002027	And, oh my gosh, if family knew I was fighting against the NCR they would be so mad at me!
WIL00002028	Yeah, I am. Why?
WIL00002029	Well, I'm from the NCR!  I don't want to be shooting them and I don't want them to be shooting at me!
WIL00002030	And, oh my gosh, if family knew I was fighting against the NCR they would be so mad at me! But at the same time, I've seen how things are here.
WIL00002031	And, the NCR probably doesn't belong here, and I trust you, but I don't really want to get tangled up in this war.
WIL00002032	...please just tell me everything's going to be okay and that I'm not a bad person.
WIL00002033	Willow, you need a drink!  Let's go get you one.
WIL00002034	Yes! A drink.  Let's do that.  Have I ever told you I like whiskey?
WIL00002035	Willow, everything is going to be okay and you aren't a bad person.
WIL00002036	Thank you.  I...I just needed to hear that.  You're so sweet.  My parents!  The thought of them is just haunting me.
WIL00002037	Willow, we all have to make hard choices sometimes, this is yours to make. I can't make it for you.
WIL00002038	Oh, okay.
WIL00002039	No, I'm just working with them for a while, why?
WIL00002040	Yes, why?
WIL00002041	Well, I'm not excited about getting involved in this war, and I wish we didn't have to do it.
WIL00002042	And I probably don't even need to say this, but  if we have to get involved I'd rather fight for the NCR.
WIL00002043	Let's talk about something else (Let's you skip personal topics and unlocks items from them for you)
WIL00002044	Okay.
WIL00002045	You should ask Veronica to train you. She loves punching things. I'm sure she could teach you a lot.
WIL00002046	I'm going to go ask her about it right now.
WIL00002047	Yes, I'm sure.
WIL00002048	Alright, I'll try to behave.  It'll be hard, though.  I really don't like her.
WIL00002049	Why are you standing there frozen like that? Let's get a move on!
WIL00002050	Sorry!
WIL00002051	Radiation!  Great.
WIL00002052	You doing okay?  Radiation!  What a pain in the butt.
WIL00002053	Uh, getting a little worried here. Am I starting to glow?
WIL00002054	So, you know, I always wondered what it would feel like to be a ghoul...Um, I think we might find out soon.
WIL00002055	Your leg?
WIL00002056	Would you look at it for me?  I don't think it's healing right.  It's still bothering me a lot.
WIL00002057	Sure, I'll look at it for you.
WIL00002058	...
WIL00002059	No, I don't think I can do it.
WIL00002060	Oh, okay.
WIL00002061	That should do it.
WIL00002062	Thank you so much!
WIL00002063	Alright.  Go do it now.
WIL00002064	Great.
WIL00002065	Wait.  Now's not a good time.  Do it later.
WIL00002066	Okay.
WIL00002067	I didn't like them very much.  Sorry.
WIL00002068	Oh, I got it that wrong.  Hmm. Well, I have something else you might like. Here.
WIL00002069	Would you like to see my collection, finally? I keep talking about it but still haven't shown it to you.
WIL00002070	There's nothing to be afraid of, Willow.  I've got your back.
WIL00002071	That does make me feel better, but I'm worried about you too.
WIL00002072	If you want me with you I'll come.
WIL00002073	Do you want to grab a bite to eat?
WIL00002074	Oh, that's a great idea.
WIL00002075	Will you join me?  It's not as much fun eating alone.
WIL00002076	Of course! I'm always hungry.
WIL00002077	I do want you with me.  Come on.
WIL00002078	Alright.  Let's get this over with. I hope we make it out of this free and alive.
WIL00002079	Why don't you wait for me here.
WIL00002080	Okay, I'll do that.  I would have come with you gladly if that's what you'd wanted, but honestly it's a relief to stay out here.
WIL00002081	I'm glad you got that off your chest, but I wasn't planning to go in there just yet.
WIL00002082	*nervous humming*
WIL00002083	I'll keep my hands to myself while we're here.  Even if there was anything good to pick up, I couldn't do it.  They need everything they've got.
WIL00002084	I'm glad we're helping out around here.
WIL00002085	Hey, you gonna be okay?
WIL00002086	NCR as far as the eye can see. You know, I feel right at home here.
WIL00002087	You're jealous!
WIL00002088	Of course I am!
WIL00002089	No, I'm not.  But I don't like her and I'm concerned for you.  She's a bitch !
WIL00002090	You're jealous!
WIL00002091	Hi, Major Knight!  How ya doin?
WIL00002092	Hi, Major, good to see ya.
WIL00002093	Hi, How are you today?
WIL00002094	Listen, I do not like being out here and I don't trust Caesar.
WIL00002095	I don't think we should go in there. This cannot be a good idea.
WIL00002096	Hi, I'm Willow.  It looks like we'll be spending a lot of time together.
WIL00002097	I bet you miss your Dinky...oh, oops.
WIL00002098	If you could do anything at all right now what would it be?  I'd take a shower.  Doesn't that sound good?
WIL00002099	Do you think you'll ever marry again, Boone?  Maybe have kids?  You'd make a great father.
WIL00002100	Are you thirsty?  I have an extra Nuka Cola if you want it.
WIL00002101	I'm glad you're with us Boone.  I feel so safe with you here.
WIL00002102	Hi, I'm Willow. It looks like we're going to be spending a lot of time together.  I hope we can be friends.
WIL00002103	Yep.
WIL00002104	Are you planning to keep working with the legion or are you done with them?
WIL00002105	You're a hero! I'm so proud of you!
WIL00002106	I'm done with them.
WIL00002107	I'm so proud of you.
WIL00002108	Um, I plan to keep working with them.
WIL00002109	Oh.
WIL00002110	No, why?
WIL00002111	Well, like I said, you don't need to worry about it.
WIL00002112	Okay, I trust you.
WIL00002113	It's the asshole!  He's here!
WIL00002114	Oh, you are not really going to sleep with him! Just don't make me watch, okay?
WIL00002115	I know he wears a checkered coat and that I should look for him in Novac. That's about it.
WIL00002116	I see a trip to Novac in our future.
WIL00002117	I know he wears a checkered coat and I've heard he's in New Vegas.
WIL00002118	New Vegas!  We could kick his ass and then go see the sights!
WIL00002119	I know he wears a checkered coat.  That's about it.
WIL00002120	I'll help all I can. What an asshole.  Him, not you.
WIL00002121	What is it?
WIL00002122	What is it?
WIL00002123	It's not the hat, Willow.
WIL00002124	It is!  I'm sure it helps.  But I still need my hat. I do have another one just like it to give you, though.
WIL00002125	I want you to take it and try it out, okay?
WIL00002126	Why are carrying two identical hats?
WIL00002127	Huh, well, that's a long story.  I don't know that I want to tell it or that you want to hear it.
WIL00002128	Okay, I'll try it.
WIL00002129	Great.
WIL00002130	Whatever.
WIL00002131	Okay, do whatever you want.  But, I'd try the hat if I were you.
WIL00002132	Oh, come on, Willow, we're best friends.  Tell me.
WIL00002133	It started before I left home.  I wasn't supposed to come to New Vegas alone.  My best friend Bethie, she was supposed to be here with me.
WIL00002134	We spent months getting ready to go. My dad made us the radios, we collected gear we wanted to take, we talked to caravan guards about routes.
WIL00002135	And that's when things went wrong.
WIL00002136	Something happened with one of the caravans?
WIL00002137	Brian, one of the guards we talked to, liked Bethie right away and started coming 'round to see her. She never said anything about it.
WIL00002138	So I kept talking about our trip, finishing up plans and getting ready to go.  About two weeks before we were supposed to leave Bethie disappeared.
WIL00002139	Poof! She was just...gone.
WIL00002140	She ran off and left you?  What a terrible thing to do!
WIL00002141	Yeah, I was devastated.  She'd been my best friend since we were little kids. I couldn't believe she'd leave without any kind of goodbye.
WIL00002142	She took off with Brian didn't she?
WIL00002143	Yeah, she left with Brian on one of his caravan routes.
WIL00002144	So, what did you do?
WIL00002145	I decided to chase her.  It took me about a week to finish getting ready and then I left.
WIL00002146	I knew where Brian's caravan was headed so that's where I went, but he left the caravan and I never did find her.
WIL00002147	The second hat was supposed to be hers. We thought matching hats would be fun.
WIL00002148	But, the hats aren't really that identical anymore. The one I've given you is nice and clean.
WIL00002149	It hasn't been torn up by geckos or gunshots.
WIL00002150	You have a new recipe for me?
WIL00002151	Yes!  This one's more complex. I call it Willow's Mantis Casserole. The only new ingredient it uses is Mantis Leg.
WIL00002152	The Mantis meat gives it a very rich flavor.  It's tasty.  I think you're going to like it a lot.
WIL00002153	You have another new recipe for me?  How many are you planning to create?
WIL00002154	I think this will be last one, but I've had a lot of fun making up the new recipes for us.
WIL00002155	Although, the new ingredient I'm adding isn't so fun to gather, but it tastes so great it's going to be worth it.  It requires Cazador eggs.
WIL00002156	I know, I know, but they taste so good.  I'm calling it Willow's Cazador Egg Puff.
WIL00002157	Things are going to get tough around here, really Hardcore.  Be prepared. (Set Essential)
WIL00002158	Bark, bark!
WIL00002159	Whine.
WIL00002160	Watch yourself, J.T.  Things are going to get tough. You could get hurt. (Set Unessential)
WIL00002161	Look, Fancy Lad Snack Cakes. One of your favorites.
WIL00002162	Thank you!
WIL00002163	I know that Raul likes sweets a lot and he seems so sad, would you consider giving it to him instead?  It would mean a lot to me.
WIL00002164	I have some GumDrops for you.
WIL00002165	Thank you!
WIL00002166	I got you some Bubblegum.
WIL00002167	Thank you!
WIL00002168	I found some Junk Food. You want it, don't you?
WIL00002169	Of course I do.  Thank you.
WIL00002170	That's a good looking dog you have.
WIL00002171	I suppose.
WIL00002172	Huh. That's an odd response. Most people are proud of their animals. You do like him don't you?
WIL00002173	Sure.
WIL00002174	Is he smart? He seems well trained.
WIL00002175	Yeah.
WIL00002176	Yeah.  What's going on?
WIL00002177	I told you when we first started traveling together that it wouldn't be for very long, but I'm having so much fun with you.
WIL00002178	And, you've become very special to me. I think of you as a friend, as a best friend actually, and I don't want to leave you or the Mojave.
WIL00002179	So, what do you say? Should we make it official?  Shall I stay and keep following you around?
WIL00002180	Now's a bad time, Willow.  We'll have to do it later.
WIL00002181	Okay, but don't forget.
WIL00002182	You have something important to talk about?
WIL00002183	I told you when we first started traveling together that it wouldn't be for very long, but I'm having so much fun with you.
WIL00002184	And, you've become very special to me. I think of you as a friend, as a best friend actually, and I don't want to leave you or the Mojave.
WIL00002185	So, what do you say? Should we make it official?  Shall I stay and keep following you around?
WIL00002186	Yes. Why don't you stay.  It's working out well for me too.
WIL00002187	Great! We'll be best friends forever!
WIL00002188	I very much want you to stay with me.
WIL00002189	Great! We'll be best friends forever!
WIL00002190	Sure, you can stay.
WIL00002191	Great! We'll be best friends forever!
WIL00002192	I was very sorry to hear about your wife, Boone.  If you ever feel like talking to someone or ever need anything I'd love to help.
WIL00002193	Boone, I was born and raised in the NCR; in Klamath.  I'm guessing you're going to keep quiet and not tell me anything about yourself. Right?
WIL00002194	You're awful good, Boone. I can see why they wanted you in the 1st Recon. Maybe if we get a chance sometime you could give me some tips?
WIL00002195	Okay, Boone, you are just too quiet.  If I confess to you that I hate Caesar and his legion will you talk to me?  Because it's true. I do hate him.
WIL00002196	I have a surprise for you, Willow!
WIL00002197	Oh, what is it?
WIL00002198	Not my strong suit, but okay.
WIL00002199	Maybe some other time.
WIL00002200	That's what I do best.
WIL00002201	We can do that.
WIL00002202	Yeah, I guess.
WIL00002203	Look!  I've been doing some scavenging myself and I've got 50 pencils for you. You'll never run out!
WIL00002204	Oh! Thank you so much! I love them.  It's one of the best presents I have ever gotten.
WIL00002205	It reminds me of my twelfth birthday, when my best friend, Bethie, went all over town and found me 12 bottles of Wonderglue.
WIL00002206	It must have taken you so long to find all of these. I appreciate it so much.  You'll just never know how much.  I love them.
WIL00002207	Forget it. You're good.
WIL00002208	Bark!
WIL00002209	(Lord Death Perk) You'd make an easy kill, that's why.  You should be wearing proper armor.
WIL00002210	Oh, okay.
WIL00002211	(Cherchez La Femme) I'd hate to see any part of you injured.  You should have proper armor.
WIL00002212	Oh, okay.
WIL00002213	(Lady Killer) Willow, every lovely part of your body is too precious to risk. You need proper armor.
WIL00002214	Yeah?  Ya, think?
WIL00002215	Yes, it's what I really want.
WIL00002216	Well, goodbye.  I don't know what else to say.
WIL00002217	No, I'm sorry.  I don't want you to go.  Please stay.
WIL00002218	Okay, I'll stay. Please don't do that again. I don't want to leave you...ever.
WIL00002219	Yes, it's what I really want.
WIL00002220	Okay, well, thanks for helping me find Beauty, and goodbye.
WIL00002221	No, I don't want you to go. Please stay.
WIL00002222	Alright. I'll stay.
WIL00002223	Okay, tell me what you want me to do and we'll see.
WIL00002224	I want enough supplies to make enough coffee to last me for a month.  Here.  I'd already written up the list in case you showed up.
WIL00002225	So, will you do it?
WIL00002226	Sure.  You'll see me again when I have everything on that list.
WIL00002227	Okay.
WIL00002228	Forget it!  I'm not getting all that stuff for you.
WIL00002229	I might still be here if you change your mind.
WIL00002230	I've got all the ingredients you wanted.
WIL00002231	Wow! Look at that!  Well, I guess you were serious then, so I'll come with you like I promised I would.
WIL00002232	Great, I just wanted to come by and see if you were still here.
WIL00002233	Yeah, I'm still here.  I haven't had any luck finding anyone to travel with yet.
WIL00002234	This place is gorgeous.
WIL00002235	It's, uh, too bad the Suite doesn't look like this, huh?
WIL00002236	I'm ready, hon.
WIL00002237	Would you do something for me?
WIL00002238	Sure.
WIL00002239	Stop fighting.(Debug to stop combat greeting but should stop enemy hunting if you're not in combat.)
WIL00002240	Okay.
WIL00002241	Take everything I have.
WIL00002242	Thanks.
WIL00002243	<Turn off Radiation comments and mask>
WIL00002244	...
WIL00002245	...
WIL00002246	<Turn on Radiation comments and mask>
WIL00002247	Willow, come here...
WIL00002248	Sure.
WIL00002249	I love you.
WIL00002250	I love you.
WIL00002251	I love you too.
WIL00002252	Come even closer.  I want a kiss.
WIL00002253	Ooh, I like that idea!
WIL00002254	Oh, anytime lover.
WIL00002255	I found something for you to put into your collection.  I think it's pretty special.
WIL00002256	Thank you so much!
WIL00002257	I have a surprise for you!  Remember you asked for a dress like Veronica or something pretty?
WIL00002258	Yes!  You have something for me?
WIL00002259	I have a new outfit for you to try on if you want. I think it will look great on you.
WIL00002260	That sounds fun.  Let's do it.
WIL00002261	Sure, but I might need a hand getting into it. You up for that?
WIL00002262	I've got something for you. I saw it and immediately thought of you.
WIL00002263	Thank you. That's so thoughtful!
WIL00002264	I hope you're done eating.  I'm ready to go.
WIL00002265	Okay.
WIL00002266	That was just what I needed.
WIL00002267	Yes, I do.  Here you go!
WIL00002268	...
WIL00002269	Alright.  This is it.
WIL00002270	Of course.  Here it is.
WIL00002271	Here it is.
WIL00002272	Hmm....Deathclaws.
WIL00002273	It's okay, you can do this.
WIL00002274	*nervous humming*
WIL00002275	*smooch*
WIL00002276	*smooch*
WIL00002277	I have one piece for you.
WIL00002278	Great.
WIL00002279	Guess we have that in common then.
WIL00002280	Heck no, Veronica! Punch everything that gets in our way.
WIL00002281	Feeling guilty?  Did you punch one of us by mistake?
WIL00002282	No Veronica, I like you just the way your are.
WIL00002283	Nope, not today.
WIL00002284	blah
WIL00002285	Klamath.  In Oregon.
WIL00002286	Klamath.  I traveled through California to get here.  It took me about two years.  I stopped a lot along the way.
WIL00002287	Oh, me too!
WIL00002288	And somewhere to go in the dress!  That'd be so great!
WIL00002289	Ooh, and maybe some pretty shoes to go with it!  And maybe a great hat.
WIL00002290	blah
WIL00002291	Why does everyone always say that?
WIL00002292	Because it's true.  We should do something about it.  Get you something that feels and looks good.  Right?
WIL00002293	I'd like you to keep quiet when we're walking around. I like the peace and quiet.
WIL00002294	Oh...okay.
WIL00002295	Okay, sure.
WIL00002296	You can chatter while we're walking around if you like.  It's kind of quiet around here.
WIL00002297	I've been thinking I'd like to create a couple of new recipes based on critters from here in the Mojave. Good idea, huh?
WIL00002298	I'll want to keep cooking if I'm going to be creating new recipes, so that would mean regular shopping trips. That'd be up to you.
WIL00002299	We can't turn back now.  I have to go in.  You can wait out here if you want to.
WIL00002300	I hate to do that.  I'm no coward, but I don't trust him, not at all.  If you want me with you I'll come.
WIL00002301	You have a new recipe for me?
WIL00002302	Thanks to you taking me shopping so much I've been able to do some experimenting and I've created a new recipe!
WIL00002303	I've only used one new ingredient though, because we have to keep track of so many already.  It's Ant Stew!
WIL00002304	I know, it sounds kind of boring, but this is the first time I've tried to make something up on my own. I think it came out pretty good.
WIL00002305	I would like you to stop singing for awhile.
WIL00002306	Okay, I can do that.
WIL00002307	Great!  I'd love to!
WIL00002308	I'd like you to start singing again.
WIL00002309	Would you cook something for us at the stove?
WIL00002310	Sure, I'd love to.
WIL00002311	Sure, I'd love to.
WIL00002312	....
WIL00002313	I'm ready.  Let's go.
WIL00002314	J.T. while you are following me I don't want you to attack anything.  At all. Understood?
WIL00002315	<whine>
WIL00002316	Bark, bark!
WIL00002317	J.T. I'd like you to fight with me again.
WIL00002318	Hi!
WIL00002319	Hi, how are you today?
WIL00002320	Hi,how ya doin?
WIL00002321	Hi, how are you today?
WIL00002322	Hi!
WIL00002323	I didn't cook anything.  We don't have what I need.
WIL00002324	Can I see what you've scavenged lately?
WIL00002325	Sure, take a look.
WIL00002326	Boone, you still look lost.  If I can help at all, just say the word.
WIL00002327	<humming>
WIL00002328	Oh!  I bet this is where they test the eye lasers.
WIL00002329	What's not to like about a place that has a giant statue to greet people when they come into town?
WIL00002330	I'm worried about those legion guys out in Nelson.  What if they attack Novac?  It'll be awful!
WIL00002331	Thank you so much for helping to get the legion out of Nelson.  I'm sure all of Novac is grateful.
WIL00002332	So now that the NCR is occupying Nelson, Novac should be safe, right?
WIL00002333	Maybe Boone could come with us when you're done helping him. He's so depressed.  It'd probably be good for him to get away from here.
WIL00002334	I like it here.  Maybe it's because I grew up in a motel.
WIL00002335	I love it here.  I know, I know.  It's dumpy and little.  But it's so cozy and homey.  Plus it's got a giant dinosaur. It's hard to top that.
WIL00002336	I wonder if No-bark's around today. He's always fun to talk to.
WIL00002337	Can we go up in Dinky sometime just to look at the view?
WIL00002338	So, our motel sign it had a couple of pine trees on it.  We didn't have anything as interesting as a big dinky.
WIL00002339	Maybe after I've seen the Mojave I'll come back here to live for awhile. Wouldn't it be fun to stay in one of the little bungalows at the motel?
WIL00002340	I wanna have some fun! Wanna go Brahmin tipping? You'll have to do the tipping though, I can never get the Brahmin to fall over.
WIL00002341	I'm so glad we fixed up the bungalow.  I love that pink bird we found.
WIL00002342	Why don't you do right, like some other men do.  Get out of here, give me some money too.
WIL00002343	*sings with no words*
WIL00002344	*hums*
WIL00002345	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed him and he kissed me.
WIL00002346	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed her and she kissed me.
WIL00002347	Heads?  You're going after heads? Actual human heads.  I hope that's something you're planning to carry yourself.
WIL00002348	Oh, I like it here!  It reminds me of my family's motel back home.  Maybe we could stay in one of the bungalows?
WIL00002349	This is...impressive.
WIL00002350	Looks like the legion might actually be able to win, doesn't it?
WIL00002351	*Hmm.
WIL00002352	Pfft. And people think the NCR is difficult!
WIL00002353	After seeing Nipton there is no way I will ever think of the legion as silly.
WIL00002354	Veronica, you have  been underground too long.
WIL00002355	Veronica, I'm sorry, I can't laugh with you about the legion. I don't find them very funny.  Okay, maybe those skirts are funny.
WIL00002356	I wonder what's next.  This place is crazy.  So far we've seen a ghoul in a wig, a human who's convinced he's a ghoul and now, demons!
WIL00002357	I thought the other guy was the crazy one, but demons?  He can't be serious.
WIL00002358	I sure hope we can do something to help Rex.
WIL00002359	Hmm.  Nope, can't think of anything interesting.
WIL00002360	I grew up with a big family too.  I have five brothers.  We lived above ground though.
WIL00002361	I really like Boone, but he's still so sad about his wife.  I don't think he'll ever notice me.  Don't say anything to him, though, okay?
WIL00002362	Hmm.  Nope, can't think of anything interesting.  Oh, wait, Cass has been drinking again.
WIL00002363	Raul seems kinda depressed. I wish we could do something for him.  I think he needs a woman, but maybe he'd take some Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
WIL00002364	Me and the Courier.  We finally...you know. I'm so in love.
WIL00002365	You know Red Lucy at the Thorn, right?  Ugh, I can't stand her, but don't tell, okay?
WIL00002366	You know Red Lucy at the Thorn, right? She's so sexy. I'm really worried about it, but don't tell, okay?
WIL00002367	Mr. House is a computer! Well, okay, maybe not, but when you talk to him he's just a picture on a screen. There's no way to tell if he's real or not.
WIL00002368	Turns out Mr. House was just this helpless old guy crammed inside a box. We found him tucked away inside the Lucky 38. It was kind of sad.
WIL00002369	He's still alive!  Can we help him?
WIL00002370	Okay, this one is definitely the craziest.  Too bad he and Antler can't come with us. They'd be interesting travel companions.
WIL00002371	I like him, and Antler too.  They're crazy, but it's too bad they can't come with us, huh?
