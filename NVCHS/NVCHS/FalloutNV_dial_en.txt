AID00098046	GREETING
AID00098047	Welcome to Novac. It's not very exciting here, but the people are friendly enough.
AID00098048	You saw the rockets explode, right? It turns out I was lucky they couldn't take me on the Great Journey.
AID00098049	Do you have any idea what went wrong?
AID00098050	I'm going to make my way to that little town we talked about.
AID00098051	Welcome to Novac. It's not very exciting here, but the people are friendly enough.
AID00098052	My engineering skills have been coming in handy, too. I've got plenty to do. Thanks for telling me about this place.
AID00098053	Hey! Over here! Are you listening?
AID00098054	Go to the big room on the east side of this building and take the metal staircase all the way up. And hurry.
AID00098055	The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
AID00098056	Baby, this little reunion of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
AID00098057	I'm surprised you fell for it, not that I'm complaining. You caused plenty enough trouble, turning Swank against me.
AID00098058	You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
AID00098059	Since you haven't pissed yourself I'll assume that you don't know who we are - next time I'll bring my sickle and wear my black cloak.
AID00098060	See, the NCR sends us when they want terrible things done to terrible people...
AID00098061	You need to be careful, it's dangerous out here!
AID00098062	Heard some more people got attacked last night.
AID00098063	Excuse me, but... are you the courier who caused all of that trouble in The Tops?
AID00098064	Hey, have you been able to bug Mr. House's network yet?
AID00098065	If it isn't the courier who's done everything he can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
AID00098066	Why don't you wait in the other room while I chat with Silus here?
AID00098067	You want to buy Wind-Brahmin?
AID00098068	Anders showed up here not too long ago. I'm told you're the one who got him out of the vault.
AID00098069	I can't tell you how relieved I am. Sending him on that mission was a mistake.
AID00098070	We're all impressed with the work you've done for us. I thought you might be able to make use of this.
AID00098071	It's a key to a little hideaway south of here. We've used it as a place for Rangers to rest and resupply. I thought you might get good use out of it.
AID00098072	Peace, traveler.
AID00098073	You again? What 'cha need, champ?
AID00098074	Unless you wanna slap leather with me you'll put that gun down, friend.
AID00098075	Who the fuck are you?
AID00098076	Shut up and keep going.
AID00098077	I don't know where the hell you're going but it's not the right way. Are you still in this?
AID00098078	What do you want now?

AID00098082	<Police Station Dialogue>
AID00098083	<Fire Station Dialogue>
AID00098084	Hello again. Remember to stop by one of these nights. Northwest, by the old train station.
AID00098085	Man, I'm sick of this place. Can't wait to get back to Red Rock.
AID00098086	The NCR sure did a number on this place.
AID00098087	Hope the NCR doesn't send reinforcements from the Dam.
AID00098088	Hard to believe this place used to be a luxury resort, huh?
AID00098089	Haven't had any reports from Station Charlie in a while - hope everything's okay.
AID00098090	Don't tell the troopers, but the grub up here is way better than the mess tent.
AID00098091	We can monitor ranger activity all through the region with the systems here.
AID00098092	I just can't believe Chief Hanlon would do that.
AID00098093	Jesus, the Chief's dead. Who's going to take over now?
AID00098094	You should talk to Chief Hanlon if you have any questions. He's usually up on the balcony.
AID00098095	A tribe called the Great Khans has joined us. They'd better be good fighters.
AID00098096	They say a doctor killed Caesar. Why would Caesar need a doctor?
AID00098097	Is Benny taken care of yet?
AID00098098	You're back. Find anything?
AID00098099	I hope they don't close the quarry. I need the money.
AID00098100	With Chomps in jail, who's going to run things at the quarry? He was our most experienced guy!
AID00098101	Maybe I was just seeing things, but I could've sworn I saw some people up on the ridge by the quarry.
AID00098102	I keep an eye out for Rangers in black armor. I haven't killed one yet.
AID00098103	Had the Legionaries at Nelson been more seasoned, we'd still hold the settlement.
AID00098104	Ave.
AID00098105	You ready to deal with Benny yet?
AID00098106	So that's it then. Benny's dead, and I'm the boss now. What can I do for you?
AID00098107	Hi there. I'm Old Lady Gibson, or so they tell me. I've got odds and ends for sale, and I'm pretty good at fixing things, too.
AID00098108	You might have noticed the very large building just north of here. That's HELIOS One. The NCR runs the place, so it's off-limits to prospectors.
AID00098109	We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
AID00098110	The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
AID00098111	Primm's got some new sheriff watching over the town now.
AID00098112	The Lucky 38's all lit up because someone infiltrated the El Dorado and flipped a switch. I'd shoot those lights out if I could.
AID00098113	I waited months to get in here, but the place isn't nearly full. You think the waiting list is just for hype?
AID00098114	The food here is to die for. No one cooks Brahmin like Philippe.
AID00098115	NCR military transmissions say the robots on the Strip have been upgraded. Wish we had eyes-on intel...
AID00098116	Mr. House is out of the picture. Probably killed by his own robots.
AID00098117	I heard you took out Caesar by yourself. Proves the Legion is just a bunch of savages, like we thought.
AID00098118	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
AID00098119	NCR military radio keeps talking about Mr. House agreeing to join the NCR. What changed his mind?
AID00098120	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
AID00098121	Seems the destruction of the monorail didn't slow the NCR down much. How many troops do they have?
AID00098122	There's a rumor going around that you saved the NCR president's life. I'm surprised you have the stones to show your face around here.
AID00098123	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
AID00098124	Were you the one who killed the NCR president? I'd like to shake your hand!
AID00098125	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
AID00098126	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
AID00098127	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
AID00098128	Seems the NCR is making friends. We've had reports of them making overtures to some gang in Freeside.
AID00098129	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
AID00098130	I heard some special squad of Rangers is on its way to the Vegas area. I guess the NCR is finally getting serious about fighting the Legion.
AID00098131	There've been reports that the NCR is moving more and more troops into the area.
AID00098132	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once I'm almost glad we're down here.
AID00098133	Keep an eye on Veronica here. She's a sharp one.
AID00098134	Try to keep Veronica out of trouble, would you?
AID00098135	If you're planning to take Veronica with you, be sure to have a good pair of earplugs with you. I'm kidding, Veronica! Put the power fist down!
AID00098136	What a fascinating animal. I'm sure the scribes will want to take a look at him.
AID00098137	You hear about that band of crazy old ladies running around? I hear they're real vicious when they mug folks.
AID00098138	If the Lucky 38 coulda been giving us power all along, why all the fuss with Hoover Dam?
AID00098139	Try sleeping with that Lucky 38 all lit up above you. Just try.
AID00098140	I hear that woman can kill with her eyes! Stay away from me!
AID00098141	Your lady friend needs to lighten up.
AID00098142	Better watch out, I hear Rex likes to eat his owners. Why do you think the King was so eager to give him away?
AID00098143	Good to see Rex still around and kicking.
AID00098144	That's one ragged Ghoul you've got with you. Seems like a good guy, though.
AID00098145	That ghoul with you looks like he's older than the war! My the things he must have seen.
AID00098146	Oh no, I hear those things eat people! Stay back, freak!
AID00098147	Odd company you keep. I thought all Super mutants were crazed cannibals.
AID00098148	Weird robot. I don't think I've ever seen one of those before.
AID00098149	That looks like one of those spybots I hear House has been secretly releasing at night.
AID00098150	Business and luck don't often go hand-in-hand in the Mojave. Watch your back.
AID00098151	Check out the Wrangler if she needs booze.
AID00098152	Keep your guns to yourself and there won't be any trouble.
AID00098153	You're not doing yourself a favor by having him tag along. NCR aren't welcome here.
AID00098154	I hear that guy has hundreds of kills, not all of them deserving of death.
AID00098155	I always thought there was more to Arcade than met the eye. I bet he'll do great things without the Followers holding him back.
AID00098156	I'm surprised to see Arcade venturing out of the Old Mormon Fort. I thought science types preferred to stay indoors.
AID00098157	Howdy.
AID00098158	Hey.
AID00098159	One of these days you'll get what's coming to you.
AID00098160	Eat shit and die. That clear enough for you?
AID00098161	We don't take kindly to your type around these parts.
AID00098162	Witch! Witch! You should be burned for all the people you've turned into newts!
AID00098163	Baby-killer! Don't deny it! They told me you mowed down an entire orphanage on a dare!
AID00098164	Necrophiliac! I heard about those corpses you dug up! Stay away from my grandparents, dammit!
AID00098165	People say you practice witchcraft and dance naked in the moonlight. What the hell is wrong with you?
AID00098166	So I hear you like picking on little kids, huh? What kind of person beats up children for their lunch money?
AID00098167	People say you wear the skin of your enemies under your clothing. Is that true?
AID00098168	Leave me alone, scumbag.
AID00098169	You're a real piece of work.
AID00098170	Great. You again?
AID00098171	You're one crazy bastard, you know that?
AID00098172	I can't decide if I should shake your hand or make a run for it.
AID00098173	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapons, eh?
AID00098174	Rumor has it you're really a posessed golem being controlled by the casinos. If this is true, where is your control crystal?
AID00098175	Planning to kill a puppy or save some goons today?
AID00098176	I have no idea what to believe when it comes to rumors about you. You must be insane or something.
AID00098177	People around here think you're a bit of an enigma.
AID00098178	Some say you like to trip old ladies crossing the street. Others say you regularly string up thugs.
AID00098179	People just don't know what to think of you.
AID00098180	Decisions are hard, aren't they?
AID00098181	We're all hoping you'll eventually figure out which side you're on.
AID00098182	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapon.
AID00098183	Thanks for everything you've done. It really means a lot.
AID00098184	I hope some of the thugs around here follow your shining example.
AID00098185	You've been a godsend to Freeside.
AID00098186	I hear you even help the local rats cross the street.
AID00098187	People are saying you must have super powers to have pulled off all you've done in Freeside.
AID00098188	My friends have nothing but good things to say when your name is mentioned. It's great to see you.
AID00098189	Word of your work around here is spreading like wildfire. Keep it up.
AID00098190	Hey, you're the one people say has been helping out around here. Good on you.
AID00098191	I tell my friends you're a shining example of what's good around here, but they're not so optimistic.
AID00098192	Thanks for helping out around here.
AID00098193	Good to see you're still around.
AID00098194	Hey, good to see you.
AID00098195	Hmm?
AID00098196	Yeah?
AID00098197	What's up?
AID00098198	I wish I were there to see you take Benny down.
AID00098199	They say you single-handedly assaulted the dam and massacred everyone! That must have been quite a sight!
AID00098200	Well, it looks like we won't have to worry about NCR or the Legion messing with us now. I just hope the Securitrons can keep the peace.
AID00098201	They say you swarmed the dam with a whole army of Securitrons! That must have been quite a sight!
AID00098202	Can't say I like all the tin cans shuffling around, but this new Securitron Army shouldn't have much trouble keeping things safer around here.
AID00098203	Why not just put the slave collars on us yourself, you bastard. With the Legion at the dam, it won't be long before they enslave us all.
AID00098204	I heard the Legion is bringing in giant mutant dogs to assault the dam. I hope the NCR death squads packed steaks to distract them.
AID00098205	Don't be fooled. As soon as the Legion and NCR start fighting, the robots will invade and kill us all!
AID00098206	I hope the Legion gets destroyed. If they take the dam, we'll all be slaves.
AID00098207	People say the NCR are bringing in super trooper death squads to defend the dam against the Legion! This battle is going to be crazy!
AID00098208	Normally, I'd say screw the NCR, but if the Legion takes the dam, I think we're all screwed.
AID00098209	Some of my friends think the Legion is throwing a huge barbeque cookout across the river. With that much smoke rising, I believe it!
AID00098210	It looks like the Legion might be preparing for another run at the dam. This can't be good.
AID00098211	Well, aren't you just special? Everybody likes the new guy, but me? I'm chopped liver.
AID00098212	I hear you're building quite the reputation on The Strip. Don't forget about the little guys when you make it big.
AID00098213	Got some fresh grub coming in from Goodsprings.
AID00098214	Joe Cobb's crew got themselves killed over in Goodsprings.
AID00098215	Who's going to take charge with Eddie out of the picture?
AID00098216	Haven't seen a decent caravan come up the road in days.
AID00098217	Think that rollercoaster in Primm is still working?
AID00098218	If it weren't for Cooke, we'd still be slaving away for the NCR.
AID00098219	Gotta wonder why the NCR hasn't come for us.
AID00098220	We sure showed those bastards in the NCR.
AID00098221	Haven't seen Meyers around. Did he run off or something?
AID00098222	Scrambler's crazier than usual. Watch yourself.
AID00098223	You hear about the Deathclaws north of here?
AID00098224	Could've sworn I saw some Great Khans the other day.
AID00098225	Steer clear of the Mojave Post. NCR troopers all over the place down there.
AID00098226	Man, I'm glad Scrambler's gone.
AID00098227	I can't believe Caesar is dead. What will we do now?
AID00098228	Caesar has been seen walking among the troops. A good omen.
AID00098229	One of our agents successfully assassinated the NCR president.
AID00098230	House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
AID00098231	If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
AID00098232	House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
AID00098233	Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
AID00098234	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
AID00098235	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
AID00098236	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
AID00098237	You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
AID00098238	I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
AID00098239	You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
AID00098240	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
AID00098241	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
AID00098242	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
AID00098243	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
AID00098244	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
AID00098245	So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
AID00098246	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AID00098247	Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
AID00098248	Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
AID00098249	That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
AID00098250	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
AID00098251	House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
AID00098252	House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
AID00098253	People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
AID00098254	You ever think about being a Ranger?
AID00098255	I'd gladly fight at your side.
AID00098256	You got my respect.
AID00098257	Leave me out of your fight!
AID00098258	Welcome to the Casa Madrid. If you got an itch needs scratching, you came to the right place. Just watch how you treat the merchandise.
AID00098259	Welcome to the Casa - so long as you didn't come here to sell that scrawny ass of yours around here.
AID00098260	I'm not hiring new girls - all slots filled, you could say - and my arrangements with Marco are exclusive.
AID00098261	I don't know what went on between you and Anderson, but leave me out of it.
AID00098262	This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
AID00098263	Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
AID00098264	We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
AID00098265	Hang on there, traveler. You'll want to steer clear of this place - the whole town is irradiated to high hell.
AID00098266	How are you coming with the dog tags?
AID00098267	You're back. What can I do for you?
AID00098268	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
AID00098269	You're a crazy son of a bitch, you hear me! The Tops!? Ha! Crazy.
AID00098270	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
AID00098271	Yeah I saw Benny running through here! He had the fear of the devil in him!
AID00098272	You killed ol' cheeser!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
AID00098273	Cheeser's dead!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
AID00098274	There are many good things in life, but peeing is definitely the best.
AID00098275	Hey! Don't poke me!
AID00098276	Ow! Why are you poking me!
AID00098277	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
AID00098278	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
AID00098279	Go bother someone else.
AID00098280	A man is never drunk if he can lie on the floor without holding on.
AID00098281	Woooooo!
AID00098282	Where'd The Kings go?
AID00098283	Hey doc! You got any Fixer?! I've got a bender planned that would make a hobo cry.
AID00098284	I think your friend wants to eat me! Please don't let him!
AID00098285	Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful busty brahmin riding a caravaneer off into the sunset... Wait I don't think that came out right.
AID00098286	I'll give you five caps for the robot!
AID00098287	Your ghoul friend looks shifty. Watch your pockets, buddy!
AID00098288	It doesn't matter if they restrict the water. We can get it elsewhere now.
AID00098289	Heard some of the Locals were attacked recently. Serves 'em right!
AID00098290	Some friends of mine were attacked the other night. Someone should do something.
AID00098291	One of these days I'll say up enough to get out of here. One of these days...
AID00098292	A guy I know said there's some kind of cannibal army camped out to the east.
AID00098293	Watch yourself if you go into one of them casinos, or you'll be stuck here like the rest of us in no time.
AID00098294	The NCR should just take this place over. Their army's big enough.
AID00098295	The Kings say they're keeping the peace, but this place is as violent as ever.
AID00098296	Did you go over by the train station last night? Bless those people.
AID00098297	It's almost time to head down to the train station. It's all I look forward to anymore.
AID00098298	Hey stranger, if you're hungry, there's a man around here somewhere telling people where to get free food and water.
AID00098299	You going over to the station tonight, too?
AID00098300	Watch out for Fiends.
AID00098301	We don't need the NCR.
AID00098302	Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to drink myself to the ground, right here. Scram.
AID00098303	Hey, scram. Come bug me when I'm at the diner... if you're a real pain in the ass.
AID00098304	Run! Beasts got free!
AID00098305	Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
AID00098306	It can't be! How the hell...
AID00098307	Holy shit! Run for your lives!
AID00098308	What a fight!
AID00098309	Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
AID00098310	Not to worry, boss. I'm sure killing the boss of one of the Families will in no way lead to savage, bloody reprisals against you and your loved ones.
AID00098311	If we run, we might still catch Benny! Well, you might. I'll just be wheezing along behind you.
AID00098312	You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
AID00098313	Ahh, overly-elaborate mob schemes to take over Vegas. Reminds me of the days before the War.
AID00098314	I can't believe we're allowed inside the Lucky 38. That place has been a legend since before the War....
AID00098315	Angry soldier robots with bazookas. I'm sure they'll be a good police force.
AID00098316	Maybe I'm just old and tired, but being locked in a cool, dark pod to sleep for a few centuries doesn't sound so bad.
AID00098317	Eesh, boss. Just... eesh.
AID00098318	Don't worry boss, I'm sure Caesar just wants to invite you over for coffee or something. That's all.
AID00098319	Hey boss, that surgery reminded me of something: I got this funny lump right down here... think you could take a look at it?
AID00098320	I'm glad you decided to off one of the most powerful men in the Mojave. Life was getting boring anyways. Really.
AID00098321	Yeah, Caesar, let's give you brain surgery in a tent. That can't possibly go wrong.
AID00098322	Caesar's death reminds me of an old saying. I can't quite remember it now, something like "sic semper tyrannosaurus."
AID00098323	Oh, good. Now there's an army of robots. You don't do things by halves, do you, boss?
AID00098324	Did blowing up that vault serve a purpose, or do you just like explosions?
AID00098325	Those poor NCR soldiers... now where will they get their hookers and gambling?
AID00098326	Be honest, you did it for the ticker-tape parades, huh boss?
AID00098327	Don't worry, boss. I'll make sure your biography says you "heroically changed your mind" about killing the president, not "choked under pressure."
AID00098328	Just to be clear, we're not planning to visit any NCR facilities, right boss? Like, ever again?
AID00098329	Well, the President's dead, but don't worry. History has shown that that sort of thing almost never leads to massive destabilizations or world wars.
AID00098330	Never been a big fan of gangs like the Fiends, boss. I'm glad they're gone.
AID00098331	The Khans didn't seem so bad to me, but what do I know? I was locked up in a cell by a crazy Nightkin for years.
AID00098332	Do you often go toe-to-toe with guys dressed as tanks, boss? That might not be great for your life expectancy.
AID00098333	I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
AID00098334	I'm sure pissing off a massive government with a huge army at its disposal was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
AID00098335	I'm sure pissing off the two most powerful factions in the Mojave was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
AID00098336	Don't worry, boss. I'm sure the sudden tension in the air is just... a thunderstorm?
AID00098337	Okay, so maybe I was wrong about the thunderstorm thing. I admit it.
AID00098338	Looks like this is gonna be the big one, boss. If you're ready, I'm with you.
AID00098339	What can I do for you, boss?
AID00098340	Took you long enough. So, can I go now?
AID00098341	I haven't heard a fresh batch of crazy coming out of the radio in a while. Does that mean I can leave?
AID00098342	Back again? Can I go this time, or do you have something else in mind?
AID00098343	Oh, it's you. You need something repaired or something?
AID00098344	Fancy meeting you here, friend.
AID00098345	Hey there, friend.
AID00098346	Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, if it ain't my old friend from Goodsprings!
AID00098347	Well... don't that beat all - it's my old friend from Goodsprings!
AID00098348	Well howdy, pardner!  You made it out of Goodsprings no worse for the wear. Good for you.
AID00098349	I reckon you'll be tracking down that varmint now. A man puts you in a grave has it coming if you ask me.
AID00098350	Damn, son, you look like ten miles of bad road.
AID00098351	A piece of advice: Watch yourself around No-Bark... I think he's studying to be a half-wit.
AID00098352	Oh... Hello. I am Michael Angelo. How can I-
AID00098353	Uh... wait. Are you here to deliver more billboard requests? Please tell me you're not a messenger on behalf of Mr. House.
AID00098354	Looks like we got a new visitor in the ol' Brahmin pen. Not many people coming here in a hurry, only passing through.
AID00098355	And if you're passing through, you picked a bad time. Road north has gone to hell, and if I let a caravan through, they won't make it.
AID00098356	Die, NCR filth!
AID00098357	Thank you for your advice. You've helped me see more clearly.
AID00098358	Flails of God!
AID00098359	Who are you? How did you find this place?
AID00098360	You're back. Any progress on saving our skins?
AID00098361	You're some kind of hero, huh? I heard about how you saved the President's life. That's incredible.
AID00098362	You've heard the news about President Kimball? Thank God he survived, but I hope the Rangers hunt down the miserable traitor that tried to kill him.
AID00098363	I just can't believe it... the President's dead. It doesn't even feel real.
AID00098364	Swank filled me in about Benny. Hell of a thing, baby. Hell of a thing.
AID00098365	Oh, come on, baby, we just got this place cleaned up after your last visit!
AID00098366	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your night?
AID00098367	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your day?
AID00098368	Well, well, well, if it ain't the best-loved cat on the Strip in my theater! What can Tommy do for you, baby?
AID00098369	Now baby, you know I welcome everybody here at the Aces, but I gotta ask you to keep any mayhem to a minimum, you dig?
AID00098370	This new act is out of sight, baby! We're bringing in the caps like a Nuka-Cola bottling plant!
AID00098371	You doing right by Tommy, baby. Two new acts? We're making this joint jump!
AID00098372	Damn, baby, you bringing in so many acts the Rad Pack's taking half the night off! I'm seriously thinking about charging them for the free liquor.
AID00098373	I got to hand it to you, baby, you did an 18-karat job on this one. My schedule's so full I couldn't put on new acts if I wanted to!
AID00098374	Welcome back! Here for another fine entertainment experience?
AID00098375	Howdy there, partner.
AID00098376	Unnnh... please... help me.
AID00098377	Thanks for getting me down from that cross. I owe you one.
AID00098378	Thanks again for saving my ass.
AID00098379	Get away from me, you lunatic!
AID00098380	Anders told me what happened. We owe you one for rescuing him. Tell you what: I can give you caps as a thank you, or a special recipe Jack cooked up.
AID00098381	Any luck finding Anders?
AID00098382	You're not one of my regulars. What do you want?
AID00098383	I've been hearing a lot of good things about you. What's up?
AID00098384	Hey! Seems like you've been making lots of friends around here.
AID00098385	Oh, uh, hey - Jack can probably give you a discount, if that'll calm you down.
AID00098386	Look, we'll be happy to sell you any chems you want, just don't do anything crazy, okay?
AID00098387	If there's something you want, spill it - otherwise, move along.
AID00098388	Make it quick - I don't want to be seen with you.
AID00098389	Dammit, someone offed Motor-Runner! That guy was one of our biggest clients.
AID00098390	Someone's been picking off the leaders of the Fiends down in New Vegas. That's going to cut into our profits.
AID00098391	Did you make that delivery yet?
AID00098392	Hey, what's up?
AID00098393	Whoa. New guy.
AID00098394	Whoa. New chick.
AID00098395	Hey, look who it is bringing that good Khan karma around!
AID00098396	How's my most favoritest friend?
AID00098397	You seriously ought to mellow out, take some chill pills. I could sell you some, if you want.
AID00098398	You seem really... high-strung. You know, I'm sure some of what I make my chems out of was an antipsychotic at some point....
AID00098399	I'm all for live and let live, you know, but a lot of folks around here... umm... aren't.
AID00098400	Why do you have to harsh my mellow? Just be cool, you dig?
AID00098401	Hey, what's up?
AID00098402	You're the one making a name for yourself among the troops, aren't you? What is it you need?
AID00098403	Ah, the vaunted hero of the Legion. What can I do for you?
AID00098404	You've been quite difficult to predict, my friend. I hope I can sway you more solidly to the Legion's way of thinking.
AID00098405	Caesar is not fond of loose cannons like yourself. I sincerely hope you change your ways before something drastic must occur.
AID00098406	I've been warned about you. You are perilously close to making an enemy of Caesar, and that is not wise.
AID00098407	I understand you've been invited to meet with Caesar. You should be aware of the honor you've been granted.
AID00098408	If we weren't in Khan territory I would kill you where you stand. Caesar will be avenged!
AID00098409	Caesar's death was tragic, but do not think that it will break the Legion's resolve.
AID00098410	Caesar's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon, and there will be no stopping our victory.
AID00098411	Greetings in the name of Caesar.
AID00098412	I understand you've been talking to the Great Khans about breaking their oaths to great Caesar. I would call that... unwise.
AID00098413	I'm so much happier now. Thank you again.
AID00098414	What do you want?
AID00098415	Oh look, it's the conformist tool.
AID00098416	How much ass did you have to kick to get Papa Khan to like you so much?
AID00098417	Oh, hey. What's up?
AID00098418	I can't believe you're talking to me, this is so cool! I mean, uh... dude, what's up?
AID00098419	You going to make fun of me too?
AID00098420	I really don't want to deal with this right now.
AID00098421	What?
AID00098422	You're the courier who's caused so much trouble for my Legion, and yet you dare come before me.
AID00098423	I heard you were wandering around. Haven't gotten yourself arrested yet, huh?
AID00098424	This is just swell - Benny vamooses and I'm left holding the bag. Whaddya need, kid?
AID00098425	Heya baby, good to see you. Always nice to have a celebrity drop by.
AID00098426	Got to admit, baby, I'm surprised to see you walking around like this. Figured you for persona non grata around here.
AID00098427	Kid, you better have a good reason for waltzing back in here and not expecting us to fill you full of lead. So talk.
AID00098428	Jesus. Benny's dead, and now I gotta take up the slack. This right here is the end of an era.
AID00098429	Hello, baby! Welcome to the Tops! What can I do for you?
AID00098430	Hey there, pal! Welcome to the Tops, and what can I do for you today?
AID00098431	You did good, putting those Omerta finks in their place. I never did trust them.
AID00098432	So all of a sudden I'm hearing word that Mr. House ain't the boss of Vegas? Baby, that's just not square.
AID00098433	Little birdies tell me you've been to visit the Lucky 38 - not a lot of folks go in there these days.
AID00098434	Hey, doll, how's my favorite girl? Got a kiss for me?
AID00098435	Couldn't stay away, huh baby? Shoulda known. What can I do for you?
AID00098436	Something else you need?
AID00098437	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
AID00098438	I didn't want to make a big deal about this until after we won, but, well...
AID00098439	I found some code snippets in one of Mr. House's databanks that will let me, um, reprogram my personality! To be a little more assertive, basically!
AID00098440	So that's what I'm going to be doing, and it's going to take me a while, so it'll seem like I'm off-line. But don't worry, everything will be okay!
AID00098441	I've updated the Securitrons' targeting parameters, so they know what to do! Vegas will be protected!
AID00098442	So that's where I'll be, off making a few changes, and I... I guess I'll see you around!
AID00098443	We accomplished a lot together! It was fun! Take care!
AID00098444	Hell of a thing about Chief Hanlon. I never would have guessed he was capable of it.
AID00098445	I've been hearing some rumors from the Embassy that Mr. House has gone quiet all of a sudden. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
AID00098446	Nice work dealing with Caesar. That'll make holding the Mojave a lot easier.
AID00098447	Have you seen these elite rangers they sent us from California? God damn those boys are gonna kick some ass!
AID00098448	Nice work with that assassination attempt! If my troops were half as dedicated as you, we'd win the war in a week!
AID00098449	Looks like the President's security detail was too good for you, huh, shitbird?
AID00098450	You oughta die for what you did.
AID00098451	Not like I even voted for him, but losing the President's a hell of a morale killer.
AID00098452	I just got word that 1st Recon is being mobilized to Nelson. God forbid we get any reinforcements here, right?
AID00098453	Seems the Misfits scored pretty well on their readiness evaluations. That strikes me as... suspicious.
AID00098454	I gotta admit, I'm impressed. The Misfits are drilling better than I ever expected.
AID00098455	I'm not sure what's going on with the Misfits - their accuracy is in the toilet, but they're spoiling for a fight like I ain't never seen.
AID00098456	Well, their test scores are only marginally improved, but I'm hearing good things about the Misfits' teamwork.
AID00098457	Ah, hell, what is it now?
AID00098458	What can I do for you?
AID00098459	You here to help, or just dick around all day?
AID00098460	Hot damn, look who it is!
AID00098461	Oh, great, like I don't have enough problems!
AID00098462	What the hell do you want?
AID00098463	What the hell do you want, you vicious son of a bitch?
AID00098464	What the hell do you want, you vicious bitch?
AID00098465	So you're back. What else do you want?
AID00098466	Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
AID00098467	Okay, we've got our dummy grenades and the course is live. We're all set.
AID00098468	The squad really seems to be working together better. It's nice, for a change.
AID00098469	What the hell happened with these readiness reports? These scores are way too high!
AID00098470	Thanks to your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
AID00098471	I don't know what Razz gave us, but holy shit this is great! I feel like I could kill an entire legion! With my teeth!
AID00098472	Haven't seen you around before, soldier.
AID00098473	Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's you're story?
AID00098474	I heard Chief Hanlon committed suicide. That's just... hard to believe. Do you know anything about it?
AID00098475	I hear Caesar's dead, and we've got you to thank for it. Nice work.
AID00098476	I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
AID00098477	I've got a friend stationed at McCarran - I heard something about a monorail explosion there. I hope he's okay.
AID00098478	Radio says you stopped the President's assassin cold. Not bad.
AID00098479	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after that assassination attempt.
AID00098480	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after you killed the president.
AID00098481	Hell of a battle at Nelson. I'm impressed our troops survived.
AID00098482	Everybody's been really nervous since President Kimball died. I don't know what's going to happen.
AID00098483	Hell of a battle at Forlorn Hope. I hope the brass can do something for the troopers' families.
AID00098484	There's some weird chatter on the radio saying something wiped out Nelson and Forlorn Hope. That's pretty scary.
AID00098485	I'm not supposed to know this, but I hear they're dispatching elite ranger units from California to deal with the Legion.
AID00098486	So now the word is Caesar's calling in his elite troops from Arizona. I don't think we're going to catch a break any time soon.
AID00098487	A bunch of units just got mobilized to Hoover Dam. This is the big one, isn't it?
AID00098488	Glad to see you haven't gotten yourself killed yet.
AID00098489	Man, the brass is going to be thrilled that you're here.
AID00098490	Friendly warning, you might want to steer clear of NCR facilities. You're not exactly popular.
AID00098491	Wow, the big celebrity down here with the common troopers. What can I do for you?
AID00098492	You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? It's just, you know... the paperwork....
AID00098493	How'd you get in here without getting shot?
AID00098494	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
AID00098495	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
AID00098496	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
AID00098497	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
AID00098498	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
AID00098499	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
AID00098500	Let me see what you got. Yeah, these'll do just fine. Just fine.
AID00098501	All right now. We're gonna be making something folks on the trail call Healing Powder.
AID00098502	Go on over to that campfire now. Give it a try.
AID00098503	Only thing you're good for is target practice.
AID00098504	Bet you'd blow up real good.
AID00098505	Watch your step, Outsider.
AID00098506	I got a shell with your name on it.
AID00098507	I can spot a Brotherhood spy from a thousand yards. Even the cute ones.
AID00098508	I don't believe there's anything left for us to talk about.
AID00098509	Go on. Go fetch a ranger and do this right.
AID00098510	Sorting and manipulating intelligence is what I do. It's what rangers are supposed to do.
AID00098511	This job isn't all gunfighting and gulping shots of whiskey, no matter what the boys and ladies out there say.
AID00098512	I've lost all respect for you.
AID00098513	If you're an enemy of the NCR, you're an enemy of mine. Get out of my sight.
AID00098514	Goddamn it! Don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
AID00098515	Hey. You. You wandered into town recently, right?
AID00098516	Get the hell away! We're done talking.
AID00098517	Welcome, child! Took your sweet time getting here, didn't you?
AID00098518	I've been waiting a good five years for an outsider to come along and visit!
AID00098519	Fuck off.
AID00098520	Who the hell are you? I know you weren't one of the inmates.
AID00098521	What the fuck have you done? We needed that sulfur!
AID00098522	Have you wiped out those geckos yet?
AID00098523	Ah, the outsider who gained our master's favor. You prove yourself as cunning as the rumors report.
AID00098524	A pleasure to meet you! I'm Dr. Thomas Hildern, Director of Operations, OSI East. I presume you're here about Vault 22?
AID00098525	Well howdy, pardner! Good to see ya again. Boss is waiting for ya upstairs, so get a move on!
AID00098526	Appreciate the help. Wish I had more work for you, but nothing else on the radar at the moment.
AID00098527	I'm helping Doctor Henry with his experiment right now, dear. Come see me again in a bit.
AID00098528	You should go talk to Blake or Alice, they handle most of our contact with visitors.
AID00098529	You should go talk to Blake or Alice, they handle most of our contact with visitors.
AID00098530	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
AID00098531	That thing is housebroken, right?
AID00098532	I like you big mutants. You're easy to sight.
AID00098533	It was such an honor to be here today. I'm so lucky.
AID00098534	I'm too young to die!
AID00098535	Maybe that guy Fantastic wasn't an idiot. Maybe he was a genius.
AID00098536	I'm heading to Gomorrah next time I get some time off.
AID00098537	I sure hope I get to meet President Kimball.
AID00098538	I wonder if the President will come this way again, he had kind of a close call I hear.
AID00098539	Mormon caravan from New Canaan came through the other day.
AID00098540	If you need a place to stay, check out Vault 21.
AID00098541	I've heard about you.
AID00098542	It's good to see you around the Strip.
AID00098543	I'm looking forward to getting sent across the river.
AID00098544	I hear the NCR and the Kings have been getting along. That's good news for Freeside.
AID00098545	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.
AID00098546	I hear the Great Khans just packed up and left Red Rock Canyon. Always thought the NCR and them would fight it out again.
AID00098547	I'll mind my business, you mind yours.
AID00098548	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
AID00098549	What do you need?
AID00098550	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
AID00098551	President Kimball is really well spoken.
AID00098552	Not right now. President Kimball is giving his speech.
AID00098553	You turned around?
AID00098554	When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
AID00098555	Step up to the tables, let's see what you got.
AID00098556	Almost outta caps...
AID00098557	I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
AID00098558	Maybe someone else in the Strip can help you?
AID00098559	If you don't mind, I rather we don't talk right now.
AID00098560	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
AID00098561	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
AID00098562	The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
AID00098563	I like the place, but I wouldn't want to live underground all my life.
AID00098564	Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
AID00098565	People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
AID00098566	I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
AID00098567	That prisoner, Benny, managed to slip away somehow.
AID00098568	Move along.
AID00098569	Imagine, a Follower brave enough to leave Freeside.
AID00098570	The dog is part-machine... but its brain is flesh.
AID00098571	What a revolting sight. To call that a friend?
AID00098572	That machine looks like a floating eye. I don't like it.
AID00098573	How does one get that blue monster to obey?
AID00098574	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AID00098575	Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
AID00098576	Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
AID00098577	As long as the Khans leave our lands alone, I don't care what happens.
AID00098578	I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
AID00098579	I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
AID00098580	Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
AID00098581	I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
AID00098582	Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
AID00098583	Everywhere I go, people are talking about our President's assassination.
AID00098584	With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
AID00098585	I see you prefer the company of anarchic cultists to civilized peoples.
AID00098586	What makes you think I give a damn about you?
AID00098587	Just, don't do anything crazy.
AID00098588	I hope you're doing well, friend!
AID00098589	Don't bother me, please.
AID00098590	This is it. War's almost upon us.
AID00098591	Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
AID00098592	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
AID00098593	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
AID00098594	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
AID00098595	Khans are history, it serves them right!
AID00098596	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
AID00098597	You killed him! What have we done to you?
AID00098598	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
AID00098599	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
AID00098600	With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
AID00098601	Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
AID00098602	If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
AID00098603	The great tower of the enemy city blazes with light. What does it mean?
AID00098604	It turns out the Lucky 38 had its own reactor all along. Now that it's operational, the city doesn't need power from the dam.
AID00098605	You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
AID00098606	People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
AID00098607	I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
AID00098608	You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
AID00098609	The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
AID00098610	If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
AID00098611	You're making it hard to trust you, you know.
AID00098612	At least you've making up for some of the trouble you've caused.
AID00098613	They said you're friendly enough, but that we ought to keep an eye on you.
AID00098614	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
AID00098615	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
AID00098616	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
AID00098617	The Legion is attacking! Run for your lives!
AID00098618	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
AID00098619	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
AID00098620	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
AID00098621	Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
AID00098622	Beats being on patrol.
AID00098623	Just lost a month's caps...
AID00098624	Some Khans got corned in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
AID00098625	Someone finally put down that sick Motor Runner sonofabitch. Good riddance.
AID00098626	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
AID00098627	Your victory is the Legion's victory. True to Caesar.
AID00098628	You are to be commended on your martial skill.
AID00098629	The Legion would have to be insane to attack this place.
AID00098630	The sound of the generators is really quite calming.
AID00098631	You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
AID00098632	The bosses of the Omergas? Omer-nas? The ones that run Gomorrah? Someone killed them.
AID00098633	I hear someone went crazy in one of the casinos on the Strip, shot the place up or something!
AID00098634	I can't believe it. Caesar's Legion attacks in force, and I actually survived!
AID00098635	Unngh... why do I feel so terrible?
AID00098636	I'm glad those nighttime raids have stopped. I was getting worried.
AID00098637	Here to meet with the brass?
AID00098638	You oughtta think about enlisting. We need you here.
AID00098639	Lot of folks at McCarran really appreciate what you've done.
AID00098640	This ain't your business. Walk off and forget you saw anything.
AID00098641	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. How can I help you?
AID00098642	Hey there, can I get you a drink, maybe a party favor?
AID00098643	You looking for a good time?
AID00098644	What the fuck are you looking at?
AID00098645	What the fuck are you looking at?
AID00098646	If I wasn't working right now, I'd show you a real nice time.
AID00098647	Enjoying the show?
AID00098648	I wouldn't mind taking a bite of you.
AID00098649	Damn, you're looking tasty.
AID00098650	Securitrons with faces like soldiers? Is this martial law or something? What the fuck?
AID00098651	So Mr. House sells Vegas out to the NCR, eh? I always knew that freak was a rat.
AID00098652	What the fuck's up with the Lucky 38 being lit up all the time, eh?
AID00098653	Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
AID00098654	I got kicked outta Ultra Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking creeps.
AID00098655	Business is good. All the Familes got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
AID00098656	I'm glad they don't let just any motherfucker through the gate. Freeside smells like shit.
AID00098657	Fiends are bad for business. NCR should do their fucking job.
AID00098658	There's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion. They better not fuck with our power.
AID00098659	Fuck Not-At-Home, must be cozy up there in the Lucky 38.
AID00098660	Bosses don't like no trouble in their place.
AID00098661	Gomorrah is always open for Business.
AID00098662	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
AID00098663	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
AID00098664	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
AID00098665	What the fuck is that thing?
AID00098666	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
AID00098667	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
AID00098668	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
AID00098669	Kings sold out to the NCR huh? Might be worth a sit down with them.
AID00098670	Word on the street is something big is about to go down at Hoover Dam.
AID00098671	I hear you been making some waves around here.
AID00098672	I hear the Legion is moving some new tough muscle into the area. NCR better keep their heads down.
AID00098673	Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
AID00098674	Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
AID00098675	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
AID00098676	You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
AID00098677	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
AID00098678	I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
AID00098679	The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
AID00098680	Glad that fucker House is gone.
AID00098681	Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
AID00098682	I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
AID00098683	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
AID00098684	Things are good since Cachino took over.
AID00098685	I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
AID00098686	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
AID00098687	Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
AID00098688	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
AID00098689	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AID00098690	I tell you, Not-At-Home is gonna have his day.
AID00098691	
AID00098692	Hello, wanderer. Please forgive us of our humble surroundings. Our true home awaits us in the Far Beyond.
AID00098693	Have you come to help us complete the Great Journey?
AID00098694	They tell me I'm supposed to sell you weapons. Interested?
AID00098695	What's up with the tower in Vegas being all lit up? I didn't know it could do that.
AID00098696	Even that old House bastard gave in to the NCR. We're the only ones to make a stand!
AID00098697	What are we going to do now that Papa's dead?
AID00098698	Doc seems to be doing all right patching people up, at least.
AID00098699	I never thought they'd actually send us reinforcements.
AID00098700	Welcome to Bitter Springs. Quite a sight, isn't it?
AID00098701	I hear there's a ghost in these mountains... and it doesn't like the NCR much.
AID00098702	Not enough food, not enough medicine, and definitely not enough sleep.
AID00098703	I don't know how we're expected to hold this place with so few men.
AID00098704	All these refugees... is Caesar's Legion really that big?
AID00098705	This is the worst detail in the Mojave.
AID00098706	Can't believe the Legion hit us in such numbers. They're stronger than we think.
AID00098707	I coughed up blood this morning. I think I'm really sick.
AID00098708	No attacks for a while now. That's a good sign, right?
AID00098709	I think there's something wrong with the food.
AID00098710	I swear I saw somebody sneaking out of the graveyard the other night.
AID00098711	Lieutenant Markland always looks like he's afraid the kids are gonna bite him.
AID00098712	Markland seems to be getting better with his bedside manner.
AID00098713	Finally got enough pills to chase off that damn infection.
AID00098714	Doc's gotten real handy with the kids these days.
AID00098715	Hope the Doc can give me some meds this week.
AID00098716	Nice to see more guards on patrol. Maybe Caesar won't murder us all.
AID00098717	Finally starting to get some decent food around here.
AID00098718	Not enough soldiers here to stop Caesar if he rolls through.
AID00098719	So tired....
AID00098720	Haven't had a decent meal in weeks.
AID00098721	Legion just came out of nowhere.
AID00098722	Fiends... cracked-out junkies.  All those chems make them a real bitch to take down.
AID00098723	We should be taking the fight to the Legion, not waiting for them to pick us apart.
AID00098724	I really hope General Oliver has a good plan if the Legion comes back.
AID00098725	Colonel Hsu really knows what he's doing. Now if only someone'd explain that to ol' General Wait-and-See Oliver...
AID00098726	I pity anyone who crosses Boyd. That woman is relentless.
AID00098727	We still haven't gotten Ranger Morales' body back from the Fiends. Sure doesn't inspire confidence in the guys you're serving with.
AID00098728	Damn shame about Morales. She enlisted to be closer to her husband.
AID00098729	Contreras is holding out on me. I know he's got more to sell.
AID00098730	Man, Doc Kemp really fixed me up right the last time I got shot. He's the man to see if you need some fixin'.
AID00098731	Farber is doing the best with what he's got, but man could I go for a nice cut of brahmin steak.
AID00098732	Hope you like it here at McCarran.
AID00098733	Make yourself at home here. It's cozy... for an airport.
AID00098734	Checking in with the base, huh?
AID00098735	I can't believe it's over. I figured the Dam would fall and this place would be our last stand.
AID00098736	Fight's gonna break out at the Dam any time now. Feels strange not being there for it.
AID00098737	The cavalry's finally here. God bless the boys in black.
AID00098738	Word is, our Ranger vets are finally coming up from Baja. The Legion should be pissing their togas.
AID00098739	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
AID00098740	With both Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope gone, you have to wonder when McCarran's gonna get attacked.
AID00098741	I've always known Camp Forlorn Hope was a death sentence. I just wish I'd been wrong.
AID00098742	They're saying we retook Nelson. Finally some good news.
AID00098743	Brotherhood's been quiet lately. Guess they finally realized Rangers beat power armor every time.
AID00098744	Heard the Kings have turned over a new leaf. Doesn't mean you'll see me in Freeside any time soon.
AID00098745	I've been seeing a lot of dead Fiends lately. Damn psychos had it coming.
AID00098746	Are you the one that killed Motor-Runner? Thank God. That guy was a living nightmare.
AID00098747	Bad time to lose Chief Hanlon. He'd have had Caesar running scared.
AID00098748	The most important POW we've ever taken and he gets away. He must've had help.
AID00098749	How could we fail to protect our own monorail?
AID00098750	Caesar's dead. So when do we go home?
AID00098751	Damn that was some light show out there.
AID00098752	That was blinding out there. Feels like I've been staring at the sun.
AID00098753	Is the plant actually working again?
AID00098754	I'm surprised they didn't send you somewhere more vital.
AID00098755	Wow, what are you doing at HELIOS? I feel like I should salute.
AID00098756	Hope you can stay. We could use your expertise here.
AID00098757	What'd you do wrong to get sent here? Thought you were an up-and-comer.
AID00098758	Are you supporting us here? We'll take what we can get.
AID00098759	Welcome to HELIOS One.
AID00098760	The attacks have stopped. Winning the dam saved our asses.
AID00098761	We lost Forlorn Hope. The eastern front is collapsing. They'll be here next.
AID00098762	Thank God we took back Nelson. Now they'll have a harder time hitting us here.
AID00098763	Heard the Brotherhood got smoked. Guess somebody finished what we started.
AID00098764	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
AID00098765	This chainlink fence perimeter is worthless. We might as well be defending a cage from the inside.
AID00098766	This place is off-limits to civilians. You don't like it, take it up with Lieutenant Haggerty.
AID00098767	The Legion's coming for us. Just a matter of time, believe you me.
AID00098768	Pretty sure H.Q. has forgotten all about us.
AID00098769	That scientist we hired has got to be the dumbest asshole I've ever come across.
AID00098770	Who knows which side the Legion's gonna hit us from next?
AID00098771	If the Legion breaks through our defenses, I got one bullet I'm saving just for me.
AID00098772	We should be up on the front lines, not out here in bumblefuck. This place is a junkyard.
AID00098773	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
AID00098774	Forlorn Hope has fallen, another victory for Caesar.
AID00098775	I have heard how you cleansed Forlorn Hope of the Profligates.
AID00098776	Nelson, Forlorn Hope... soon Caesar's banners shall rise on Hoover Dam.
AID00098777	Our march to the Dam is assured.
AID00098778	With Forlorn Hope's fall, our blades are at the NCR's throat.
AID00098779	Our machetes ran thick with blood here.
AID00098780	I hope to Caesar that the Profligates will send more victims to us.
AID00098781	The Profligates here were weak, no fight in them.
AID00098782	This is only the first settlement to fall.
AID00098783	The bodies of beggars and cowards fill Nelson's streets now.
AID00098784	Dead Sea has erected a tribute to Caesar - made of Profligate corpses.
AID00098785	When we're fortified here and reinforced, Forlorn Hope will be next.
AID00098786	We kill only those who resist the will of Caesar. The rest are kept as tribute.
AID00098787	Some of Nelson lives on... as slaves. They are being kept nearby.
AID00098788	If the rest of the Profligate settlements are as weak as this, Caesar's victory is assured.
AID00098789	This is only part of our detachment. We have others stationed nearby.
AID00098790	Speak to our Decanus, Dead Sea.
AID00098791	We do not move unless Dead Sea commands it.
AID00098792	We can see the Profligate cowards stationed on the hill, afraid of us.
AID00098793	You may walk here - but do not head west along the road.
AID00098794	That we hold Neslon, that is Caesar's will.
AID00098795	You meet any of those Rangers dressed up in black yet? My friends say they're mutant cyborgs and they're going to kill us all!
AID00098796	That new Ranger armor is downright impressive. I'd hate to be on the business end of one of their revolvers.
AID00098797	We've already got people disappearing at night. I hear the NCR have veterans from out west coming to push us out of Freeside.
AID00098798	I've been hearing rumors of the Rangers getting some heavy reinforcements soon. Hope they don't try to start anything around here.
AID00098799	The NCR must have paid off the Kings big to get them to sign up. Maybe there was an NCR mole who tricked them into it!
AID00098800	Good news for Freeside. The Kings have decided to work with NCR for a change.
AID00098801	I hear the Kings were wiped out by some kind of Super mutant ninja assassin paid by the NCR! Who else could have taken them down?!
AID00098802	I don't get why the Kings are dead. They weren't a bad bunch of guys.
AID00098803	Some people are saying the Great Khans got drugged up out of their minds and attacked the dam.
AID00098804	I heard the Khans went wild at Hoover Dam. I suppose they were looking for one last blaze of glory.
AID00098805	I hear the Great Khans staged their own deaths to trick the NCR.
AID00098806	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
AID00098807	The Great Khans aren't gone. They're just hiding, biding their time...
AID00098808	The Great Khans moved out? One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
AID00098809	The Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I've heard some crazy rumors before, but that one's rich!
AID00098810	So, the Great Khans signed up with NCR. Who would have thought those two would settle their differences?
AID00098811	Those sick Legion bastards had the brass balls to attack Bitter Springs? I bet that was one messy fight.
AID00098812	Maybe it'll be a little safer to travel, now that the Fiends' bosses are dead. We owe their killer a debt of gratitude.
AID00098813	I heard Motor Runner got taken down. Maybe the Fiends will finally destroy themselves now that he's gone.
AID00098814	I hear Hanlon was abducted by aliens and that's why he was acting so strangely. Better check yourself for strange scars.
AID00098815	Hanlon was apparently sabotaging NCR's efforts in the area. Now, I kind of wish he hadn't died.
AID00098816	I hear Hanlon was working for the aliens and NCR found out.
AID00098817	Chief Hanlon is dead? I hear that guy couldn't order himself out of a cardboard box, let alone command troops
AID00098818	My friends say Kimball's assassination was all an Illuminati plot to reclaim power. I say they're crazy. How do you kill someone with a flashlight?
AID00098819	Kimball getting killed is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
AID00098820	My friends say you're working for the Illuminati, and that's why you killed Kimball. Watch your back. They have listening devices everywhere!
AID00098821	Killing Kimball is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
AID00098822	Thanks for not killing Kimball. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
AID00098823	So, I hear that assassination attempt on Kimball didn't quite turn out the way you planned. Now, the NCR are going to be even pissier than usual.
AID00098824	Good job saving Kimball's life. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
AID00098825	I suppose you did the right thing saving Kimball, even though it means we're still screwed here in Freeside.
AID00098826	You freed that Silus guy from McCarran? Guess you've got your reasons for helping the Legion.
AID00098827	I hear the monorail bombing was an alien plot. Just a few more gates to destroy and we're all trapped in here.
AID00098828	I guess the monorail getting bombed wasn't all bad. Freeside is getting a lot more business now.
AID00098829	With the monorail down, we're going to have a lot more NCR goons wandering through here. Yay...
AID00098830	Rumor has it Mr. House joined the NCR on account of some secret love child he never even knew he had.
AID00098831	Never thought I'd see House settle for being an NCR lapdog. What the hell happened?
AID00098832	I think Caesar was killed by alien clone agents! The Legion are just a bunch of alien slaves doing their bidding!
AID00098833	I hear Caesar had an alien brain chip in his head, but he died on the operating table when they tried to remove it.
AID00098834	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
AID00098835	You killed Caesar? Rumor around here has it he was struck down by a bad case of explosive diarrhea.
AID00098836	All hail the slayer of Caesar! It's about time that slavemaster got his!
AID00098837	I don't need to read no obituary to know House was an asshole.
AID00098838	With no House to boss Vegas around, the NCR's gonna want that job.
AID00098839	According to the rumor mill, House is faking his death to catch the NCR off-guard.
AID00098840	House dead? Good riddance.
AID00098841	Better give the Securitrons a wide berth if you know what's good for you. Those new upgrades look nasty.
AID00098842	House must have special plans for you to get into the Lucky 38 and come out alive.
AID00098843	I hear you made a real mess of the Omerta's plans. Hopefully, the new management does a better job running Gomorrah.
AID00098844	Impressive work fighting off Benny's thugs! I know I wouldn't have survived that.
AID00098845	I heard you made a run on The Tops. You've got guts, kid.
AID00098846	Figures that Benny would run. Sorry coward's nobody without his thugs to back him.
AID00098847	Private Watson sure seemed excited about meeting Kimball.
AID00098848	I actually got to see the President.
AID00098849	I hear President Kimball had a pretty close call with some assassins.
AID00098850	The death of the President is going to be a permanent blight on this place.
AID00098851	If the President of our republic isn't safe here, how can we be?
AID00098852	Kimball died, security seemed so tight, how could such a thing happen?
AID00098853	President Kimball is going to arrive pretty soon to give his speech and meet that wounded soldier.
AID00098854	How do we know if Mr. House is really gone? No one's ever seen him in the first place!
AID00098855	Colonel Moore survived four tours against the Brotherhood back west. If anyone can help take on the Legion, it's her.
AID00098856	You hear that rumor that Colonel Moore was kicked out of Gomorrah a while back? I heard she's had it in for the Omertas ever since.
AID00098857	I'm really surprised Colonel Moore accepted the Brotherhood's help. I heard she lost a lot of men in war with them back west.
AID00098858	Is it true? Was there really a Brotherhood base nearby that blew sky high?
AID00098859	I heard a rumor that Moore hired some mercs to wipe out the Khans. Is that such a good idea, with Bitter Springs still on peoples' minds back home?
AID00098860	Man, I'm exhausted. Moore's got us running drills non-stop.
AID00098861	Just between us, Colonel Moore scares me sometimes.
AID00098862	Our victory was never in question.
AID00098863	How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
AID00098864	Let's get going!
AID00098865	The Crimson Caravan's the biggest merchant outfit in the wasteland.
AID00098866	Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
AID00098867	I'm glad Ringo's back. Got a good story to tell, too.
AID00098868	Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
AID00098869	Keep an eye out for wildlife.
AID00098870	When pay day hits, I'm off to the Strip. Can't wait.
AID00098871	Did you know you have a robot following you?
AID00098872	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
AID00098873	Keep your distance, soldier.
AID00098874	A doctor? Who's your supplier?
AID00098875	Idle thumbs tend to get blown off around here. Get moving.
AID00098876	Sorry, I've got work to take care of.
AID00098877	I'd keep moving if I was you.
AID00098878	Go back to the Strip where you belong.
AID00098879	You're nothing like us, Outsider.
AID00098880	We should have never let you in.
AID00098881	You're no different than a common Fiend.
AID00098882	What are you looking at?
AID00098883	Keep your distance.
AID00098884	I'm not sure what to make of you, Outsider.
AID00098885	What do you know about our problems?
AID00098886	Welcome back.
AID00098887	Hey there. Kill any Outsiders lately?
AID00098888	You can shoot with me anytime, friend.
AID00098889	Always nice to see you.
AID00098890	Hope the trip into camp wasn't too eventful!
AID00098891	Keep your head down, Outsider.
AID00098892	I've got my sights on you, Outsider.
AID00098893	Stand back where I can see you.
AID00098894	Saw you coming a mile away.
AID00098895	I actually got to fly Pearl for a little bit during that boming run. Hot damn, what an honor.
AID00098896	All those hours training? Glad they finally paid off.
AID00098897	Did you see it? I hear the suckers burned right through their armor.
AID00098898	It was wonderful seeing Pearl fly and serve the purpose she was built for.
AID00098899	It's getting nasty out here. S'times like these I thank god for artillery.
AID00098900	War's brewing on the horizon, plain as day.
AID00098901	We've survived out here pretty well so far without any help from the outside.
AID00098902	You should get out of my face before you get yourself hurt.
AID00098903	I don't have anything to say to you, outsider.
AID00098904	I don't know how you survived the bombardment. That's incredible.
AID00098905	I don't think you should be here.
AID00098906	I'm happy you came along. You are the answer to our dreams.
AID00098907	You've earned our trust, now let's see if you can earn our gratitude.
AID00098908	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
AID00098909	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
AID00098910	I hear you're going to help us, I hope you're up for the task.
AID00098911	I'm happy that we managed to raise the bomber in my lifetime.
AID00098912	Thank you so much for your help.
AID00098913	I didn't think the day would ever come, but thanks to you our dreams have come true!
AID00098914	I'm amazed that an outsider has proven so helpful.
AID00098915	You've given us the ability to touch the sky! Thank you.
AID00098916	You've done us a great service. Thank you.
AID00098917	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
AID00098918	I'm not going to take anything from you. Leave me alone!
AID00098919	Hey! You tried to get me sick!
AID00098920	You should learn to give kids nice things... Like toys!
AID00098921	You're the one that tried to give me that yucky stuff.
AID00098922	I don't think I should talk to you. You aren't very nice.
AID00098923	You need to leave me alone. I don't like you anymore.
AID00098924	You're lots of fun. We should play sometime.
AID00098925	I'm going to be a hero and travel the wasteland like you when I grow up.
AID00098926	I'm going to tell Mama Pearl how cool you are.
AID00098927	I bet you have all kinds of fun stories.
AID00098928	I like you, we should play sometime!
AID00098929	Thanks for the toy! It was great!
AID00098930	I'm going to play raise the B-29!
AID00098931	I can't believe Pearl let you stay with us.
AID00098932	I sure hope Pearl knows what she's doing.
AID00098933	Fucking Crocker couldn't find his ass if it wasn't on his backside...
AID00098934	Don't be carrying any guns into the casino.
AID00098935	You look like you just crawled out of the desert.
AID00098936	Love how this place comes alive at night.
AID00098937	You should see this place at night.
AID00098938	Looking to lose a few caps, huh? Just the place.
AID00098939	I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
AID00098940	I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
AID00098941	We need more people like you in the NCR.
AID00098942	We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
AID00098943	We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
AID00098944	You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
AID00098945	The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
AID00098946	A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
AID00098947	I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
AID00098948	It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
AID00098949	Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
AID00098950	NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
AID00098951	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
AID00098952	Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
AID00098953	I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
AID00098954	My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
AID00098955	So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
AID00098956	Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
AID00098957	It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
AID00098958	 I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
AID00098959	My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
AID00098960	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
AID00098961	What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
AID00098962	They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
AID00098963	The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
AID00098964	The camps are getting crowded.
AID00098965	Slaves aren't much of a challenge in the arena.
AID00098966	I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
AID00098967	Caesar lives!
AID00098968	I'll mourn Caesar - he was a great man.
AID00098969	All that Caesar promised has come true.
AID00098970	Ave, amicus.
AID00098971	Look to Bitter Springs to see what happens to disloyal slaves.
AID00098972	I've heard the stories of how you assassinated Kimball. It's all my Legionaries will about.
AID00098973	Kimball's assassin is always welcome here.
AID00098974	The Centurion Silus will be punished for letting himself be captured. Coward.
AID00098975	Legatus Lanius is come. The battle for the dam will soon begin!
AID00098976	Legatus Lanius will arrive soon enough - and with him comes slaughter.
AID00098977	Legatus Lanius draws near. The Profligates' days are numbered.
AID00098978	Legatus Lanius is known as the Monster of the East - a name he has earned many times over.
AID00098979	The black-armored Rangers are said to be fearsome in battle.
AID00098980	The Legionaries fret like women over rumors of Rangers in black armor.
AID00098981	There have been sightings of Rangers in black armor, the best the Profligates have to offer.
AID00098982	I wish I could hear the Profligates weeping over the explosion at McCarran!
AID00098983	The Mark of Caesar protects you.
AID00098984	The warlord House thought himself beyond Caesar's reach. And now he is dead.
AID00098985	Never once did I believe that was near death. I have friends in high places.
AID00098986	The Legion will survive Caesar's death. It must!
AID00098987	I felt the earth shake when the evil below the Fort was destroyed!
AID00098988	Soon the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona. Each has killed many times his number.
AID00098989	Our hounds were bred to kill. They are missed.
AID00098990	It's said that every living thing at Nelson and Forlorn Hope camp was killed.
AID00098991	I hear the Profligates at Forlorn Hope begged for their lives.
AID00098992	Had I been the commander of our forces at Nelson, the town would still be ours.
AID00098993	The Legionaries at Nelson were killed to a man. No survivors.
AID00098994	So frightened are the Profligates that they've begun signing treaties with primitive tribes!
AID00098995	Keep barking and I'll feed you to a dog.
AID00098996	Watch yourself, Profligate.
AID00098997	Hold your tongue, wastrel.
AID00098998	Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
AID00098999	Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
AID00099000	You belong on a cross, degenerate.
AID00099001	I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
AID00099002	When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
AID00099003	Give me cause, Profligate.
AID00099004	Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
AID00099005	You aren't trusted here, Profligate.
AID00099006	You serve yourself, not the Legion.
AID00099007	Why is your degneracy tolerated?
AID00099008	You can't be trusted... but you're useful.
AID00099009	How are we to trust one such as you?
AID00099010	Who knows what you'll do next?
AID00099011	You're a crazed one. I'll not talk to you.
AID00099012	You do well to serve the Legion.
AID00099013	You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
AID00099014	You've proved yourself useful, at least.
AID00099015	You serve the Legion well, amicus.
AID00099016	We each serve the Legion, in our way.
AID00099017	Good to see you, amicus.
AID00099018	Ave, amicus.
AID00099019	I know your kind. You die easily enough.
AID00099020	Have you seen the Legion's veterans, arrived from Arizona? They are fearless!
AID00099021	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
AID00099022	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
AID00099023	Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
AID00099024	Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
AID00099025	People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
AID00099026	I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
AID00099027	I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
AID00099028	House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
AID00099029	You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
AID00099030	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
AID00099031	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
AID00099032	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
AID00099033	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
AID00099034	We owe you so much for saving our President.
AID00099035	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
AID00099036	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
AID00099037	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
AID00099038	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
AID00099039	The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
AID00099040	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
AID00099041	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
AID00099042	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
AID00099043	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
AID00099044	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
AID00099045	I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
AID00099046	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
AID00099047	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
AID00099048	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
AID00099049	Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
AID00099050	I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
AID00099051	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
AID00099052	Things are getting stranger every day.
AID00099053	It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
AID00099054	Back home we don't waste time talking to strangers, either.
AID00099055	I really have more important things to do, sorry.
AID00099056	Good to see a friend of our government.
AID00099057	The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
AID00099058	I'm glad to see you.
AID00099059	The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
AID00099060	You're a model citizen, thank you.
AID00099061	What do you want with me?
AID00099062	You're not going to cause any problems, right?
AID00099063	Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
AID00099064	I don't want any trouble, okay?
AID00099065	What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
AID00099066	Don't talk to me!
AID00099067	I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
AID00099068	We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
AID00099069	I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
AID00099070	I should make you pay for your crimes!
AID00099071	I've seen Followers of the Apocalypse in my travels before.
AID00099072	NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
AID00099073	Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
AID00099074	Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
AID00099075	I've never seen a robot like that before.
AID00099076	The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
AID00099077	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AID00099078	Sometimes friend, sometimes foe. No one knows what to make of you.
AID00099079	I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
AID00099080	I'm not looking for trouble. You can ignore me.
AID00099081	Excuse me.
AID00099082	My feet are killing me.
AID00099083	It's said that you were responsible for Caesar's death.
AID00099084	The Legionaries are pleased - an enemy called the Brotherhood of Steel is dead.
AID00099085	The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
AID00099086	The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
AID00099087	I've heard that a great enemy of the Legion was assassinated in New Vegas.
AID00099088	Caesar was ill, but now he lives.
AID00099089	How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
AID00099090	Ugh. One of the burned people walks in our camp.
AID00099091	What a strange floating robot. Is it useful for anything?
AID00099092	What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
AID00099093	I overheard some of the Legionaries say that more veterans from the eastern campaigns will be summoned to the Fort.
AID00099094	The leader of New Vegas and his army of robots has defeated both the NCR and the Legion. What will happen now?
AID00099095	There's talk that many of the ranking Legionaries will be beheaded for allowing the NCR to defeat the Legion yet again.
AID00099096	A great battle is coming. Many veterans of the Legion have begun arriving from the east.
AID00099097	There are many rumors about who'll lead the Legion now that Caesar is dead.
AID00099098	That was quite an explosion a while ago. We felt the ground shake!
AID00099099	I've heard rumors that one of the tribes west of the river may join the Legion.
AID00099100	The work never ends...
AID00099101	So many tasks to attend to...
AID00099102	I need to rest.
AID00099103	It's best if I'm not seen talking to you.
AID00099104	Be careful, or you'll end up being crucified.
AID00099105	The Legionaries grumble about you. Be careful.
AID00099106	The Legionaries want to kill you. Please don't get me involved.
AID00099107	The Legion hates you. Why do you come here?
AID00099108	Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
AID00099109	You're trouble, I can tell.
AID00099110	Be careful - the Legionaries aren't sure they can trust you.
AID00099111	You're not quite an enemy, nor are you a friend.
AID00099112	Your favor with the Legion grows, I've heard.
AID00099113	Some of the Legionaries talk about you with growing respect.
AID00099114	I'm honored to serve.
AID00099115	Someone as important as you noticing me? I'm flattered.
AID00099116	The Legionaries speak highly of you. I'm not worthy of your attention.
AID00099117	It's an honor to be noticed by one so favored by the Legion.
AID00099118	You're a woman, and yet you wander free?
AID00099119	I hear you've done some good things for the Followers.
AID00099120	The Followers are always on the look on for new friends like yourself.
AID00099121	I appreciate how you've been helping us so far.
AID00099122	I really don't have anything you'd want.
AID00099123	Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
AID00099124	I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
AID00099125	You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
AID00099126	The Followers can't trust you, you've proven that.
AID00099127	I never imagined Mr. House would concede to the NCR. I wonder what convinced him...
AID00099128	When people have got nothing left, they can always turn to the Followers.
AID00099129	The Gun Runners ought to help the Followers by donating some of that firepower they've got.
AID00099130	Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
AID00099131	Stay alert.
AID00099132	Keep an eye out for trouble.
AID00099133	There are so many refugees to care for.
AID00099134	Medicine's running low again.
AID00099135	All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
AID00099136	I have no idea how most of these people would survive without us.
AID00099137	I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
AID00099138	Look at that - a cyber-dog. There can't be many of those left.
AID00099139	Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
AID00099140	That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
AID00099141	Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
AID00099142	That's a First Recon beret. They're the best marksmen in the NCR military.
AID00099143	I'll never get used to the sight of ghouls.
AID00099144	The Brotherhood had a bunker in Hidden Valley, but it was destroyed somehow.
AID00099145	I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
AID00099146	The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
AID00099147	President Kimball was careless and overconfident, and it got him killed.
AID00099148	Who would have thought someone would try to assassinate President Kimball with all those troops around?
AID00099149	Did you see the monorail explode? The destruction was absolute.
AID00099150	Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
AID00099151	No one knows how Mr. House died. His obituary didn't say anything useful.
AID00099152	The Securitrons in and around the Strip have been upgraded. It's almost like Vegas has an army now.
AID00099153	Someone entered the Lucky 38. That's never happened before.
AID00099154	Big shakeup in the management at Gomorrah. I wonder what that's about?
AID00099155	Someone killed Benny, the Chairmen's bigshot, in his own casino. Violence begets violence...
AID00099156	Did you hear about the shootout at The Tops?
AID00099157	We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
AID00099158	Don't let anything happen to Arcade, all right?
AID00099159	That a pretty gal! Want to share?Ha ha ha!
AID00099160	We got ourselves a little Ranger family reunion now. Time's right for a feud.
AID00099161	Hell of a place, huh?
AID00099162	Staying long?
AID00099163	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
AID00099164	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
AID00099165	Wish I could've been there, defending Camp Forlorn Hope. Even if it didn't change anything.
AID00099166	Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
AID00099167	From here on out, we fight for Chief Hanlon.
AID00099168	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
AID00099169	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
AID00099170	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
AID00099171	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
AID00099172	All you need is one Ranger protecting the monorail. You don't even need to feed him that much. He'll get it done.
AID00099173	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
AID00099174	Hoover Dam... just thinking about it makes me nervous.
AID00099175	One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
AID00099176	The Ranger vets are on their way from Baja. Never seen one before. But I've heard they chew nails and spit napalm.
AID00099177	We put our trust in Hanlon and look where it got us. Makes you wonder if we can trust anyone at all.
AID00099178	Chief Hanlon's watching over us now. He won't let us lose.
AID00099179	They got to President Kimball. How long can we hold out?
AID00099180	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
AID00099181	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
AID00099182	When I got this assignment I was hoping there'd be more gambling.
AID00099183	Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
AID00099184	Why don't you go join the rest of the human trash across the river?
AID00099185	Come on. Give me a reason.
AID00099186	Shooting you right now might be worth the court-martial.
AID00099187	I suggest you leave.
AID00099188	Keep walking.
AID00099189	You got a lot of nerve walking around here.
AID00099190	You need to get your head straight. If you're fighting for us, act like it.
AID00099191	You're insane. We shouldn't be letting you run loose around here.
AID00099192	How are we supposed to trust you? You're completely unpredictable.
AID00099193	Everything you've been up to... I just don't know what you're trying to pull.
AID00099194	At least the Legion knows what they're fighting for. When are you gonna figure it out?
AID00099195	Why don't you pick a side? We did.
AID00099196	Honored to speak with you, sir.
AID00099197	Honored to speak with you, ma'am.
AID00099198	You know, if you were serving, you'd probably be halfway to general by now.
AID00099199	Nice job out there.
AID00099200	Glad you're with us.
AID00099201	Hey. Welcome aboard.
AID00099202	I'm not sure you should be here.
AID00099203	You lost?
AID00099204	We won't go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
AID00099205	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
AID00099206	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
AID00099207	Nelson's back in our hands. I hope we can defend it this time.
AID00099208	Is it me, or has the Brotherhood stopped engaging us? Smartest move they ever made, you ask me.
AID00099209	Smart move for the Kings to back down. They didn't know who they were messing with.
AID00099210	We signed a treaty with the Great Khans. Guess you can never have too many lowlife chem dealers on your side.
AID00099211	Sickens me that the Legion would try to harvest slaves from a refugee camp.
AID00099212	President Kimball is lucky he escaped. I don't think we could lose him right now.
AID00099213	Wish I could've been there to see Caesar die. What an asshole.
AID00099214	Monster of the East, huh? Well I've got the Monster of the West in my holster right now. Hope I get to introduce them.
AID00099215	Got business here?
AID00099216	Your friend's cute - is she single?
AID00099217	I hope Papa knew what he was doing when he left you in charge.
AID00099218	A robot dog? Never seen one of those before.
AID00099219	Your pal's one ugly motherfucker.
AID00099220	Holy hell, is that a Nightkin?
AID00099221	Nice robot.
AID00099222	You know you're traveling with a fucking murderer?
AID00099223	Haven't seen a Follower around here in years.
AID00099224	Huh?
AID00099225	What?
AID00099226	I ought to bleed you.
AID00099227	Fuck off and die.
AID00099228	Like we don't have enough problems.
AID00099229	Just get the fuck out of here.
AID00099230	What the fuck are you doing showing your face here?
AID00099231	Why are you even here?
AID00099232	Crazy-ass mother fucker.
AID00099233	You been dosing on too many of Jack's chems?
AID00099234	You're almost as crazy as some Fiends I know.
AID00099235	Oh great, just who I wanted to see.
AID00099236	You going to fuck shit up again?
AID00099237	What do you want this time?
AID00099238	You should have been with us in our glory days. You'd have loved it.
AID00099239	Share a whiskey with me sometime?
AID00099240	I wish there were more like you.
AID00099241	I like you, stranger. You've stood by us when not many would.
AID00099242	Good to see you again.
AID00099243	Why'd you come here?
AID00099244	Come to gawk at the Great Khans, have you? Fuck off.
AID00099245	What do you want?
AID00099246	The Legion and the NCR have mobilized their forces at Hoover Dam - it'll be time soon.
AID00099247	It's starting to feel like tensions are coming to a boil. There will be full-scale war soon.
AID00099248	Seems like everybody with a stake in the Mojave is gearing up for something big.
AID00099249	So you've been sucked into the decadence of the Strip as well, have you?
AID00099250	Caesar's veterans are making short work of the NCR - or that's what I hear.
AID00099251	Soon Caesar will send in his best troops from the Arizona campaign - the NCR won't know what hit them.
AID00099252	Those black-armored devils might be new to the Mojave, but they're butchers like all the rest.
AID00099253	The runners are saying that the NCR is sending in their elite shock troops to try and push back the Legion.
AID00099254	NCR spreads its infection to another town, I hear.
AID00099255	I'm glad our brothers have returned home from Boulder City.
AID00099256	Why did you kill our brothers in Boulder City?
AID00099257	More Khan brothers cut down by NCR in Boulder City. We should kill a hundred of them in response!
AID00099258	The 1st Recon butchers are in the field again. I'd love to head down to Forlorn hope and show them we haven't forgotten.
AID00099259	So the NCR makes peace with the Kings now? Where was that mercy at Bitter Springs?
AID00099260	Another tribe was wiped out in NCR territory? Can't say I'm surprised. I hope the surviving Kings learn from this.
AID00099261	Our tribe's final stand will be remembered for a thousand years!
AID00099262	We'll return, stronger than before!
AID00099263	I can't believe they're all gone.
AID00099264	So the Legion hit the murderers at Bitter Springs? Good.
AID00099265	We're not moving as many chems now that the Fiends have been taken out.
AID00099266	Diane's going nuts trying to find a new contact in the Fiends now that Motor Runner's dead.
AID00099267	Typical - even within their highest ranks, the NCR is corrupt.
AID00099268	So, the big bad chief ranger couldn't take the pressure, huh? Good.
AID00099269	If I knew who killed Kimball, I'd buy him a drink.
AID00099270	If you're going to assassinate the president of the NCR, you could at least do it right.
AID00099271	Why the hell would you stop someone from killing Kimball?
AID00099272	If you ask me, a true warrior wouldn't let himself be captured at all - but busting that Legionnaire out of McCarran was an impressive stunt.
AID00099273	I would have thought the monorail bombing would slow the NCR down more.
AID00099274	Whoever blew up that monorail is a damn hero.
AID00099275	Karl's been in a shitty mood since that big explosion at the Fort.
AID00099276	Word's spreading that Caesar is dead. No one seems to know much about how, though.
AID00099277	Caesar can rot in hell for all I care.
AID00099278	Not many get the favor of Caesar - even Papa hasn't been to the Fort.
AID00099279	Rumor from the Strip is that House is dead. I hope the old bastard choked on his own tongue.
AID00099280	Mr. House isn't a man to be trusted. Watch yourself.
AID00099281	I heard from one of Melissa's runners that that check-coated bastard got thrown out on his ass.
AID00099282	Papa says "cut off the head and the snake will die." I guess the Chairmen's days are numbered.
AID00099283	I remember the Chairmen from their tribal days. They were punks then, they're punks now.
AID00099284	You really killed Caesar himself? Maybe he's not the mighty warrior Karl said he was.
AID00099285	You're the one who killed Kimball! If we had a bar here, I'd buy you a drink!
AID00099286	We're fighting for the NCR now? I don't know about that....
AID00099287	You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
AID00099288	Antler says you are the one killing my kin. Antler says you must die!
AID00099289	I... don't know how to thank you for bringing Rhonda back to me, stranger.
AID00099290	Here, take this. I won't be needing it anymore.
AID00099291	Good work, human. Maybe now this place can rest in peace.
AID00099292	There's nothing for you here, human, though it is always good to see you.
AID00099293	I've done what I can. The rest is up to you, human.
AID00099294	This is a dangerous place, human - especially for your kind! I suggest you turn back. There's nothing good waiting for you further on.
AID00099295	Still hanging about?
AID00099296	Hey, you've interrupted my broadcast, dumb-dumb - so there had better be a good reason! What is it?
AID00099297	A pleasant surprise to see you made it. I'm ready to get started if you are.
AID00099298	We shouldn't wait much longer. Are you ready?
AID00099299	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
AID00099300	I don't even remember where we were going, but It'll be good to travel around with Rhonda again.
AID00099301	Howdy pardner! Welcome to the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum.
AID00099302	This is a restricted area. Step away immediately.
AID00099303	Go to hell.
AID00099304	I'm heading back West. You won't see me again.
AID00099305	God, there's almost nothing left. Looks like whoever it was - was just in the mood for killing.
AID00099306	Most of the cargo's ash, too - not burned, looks like... disintegrated. When I heard the reports, I assumed "ash" meant "burned."
AID00099307	So close to the Vegas wall, too, don't that beat all. Must have happened during the day, though, they hadn't made a camp.
AID00099308	You know what, what happened to my caravan - not the first time I've heard about an attack like that.
AID00099309	One of our caravans got hit back a few months back, and the caravan'd been burned, too, along with the cargo.
AID00099310	I wonder if he made the same mistake, and that other caravan got hit with energy weapons, too.
AID00099311	More energy weapons hit this caravan. Place has been picked clean.
AID00099312	This... is Brotherhood level murder here. But they don't do things like that. This was done with a purpose.
AID00099313	Let's poke around a bit, see what we can find. Might be something in the wreckage.
AID00099314	What's that? Looks like a map - got the route along the West of Vegas, and...
AID00099315	...they've marked another spot. Over here, along this stretch. That's fucked up - middle of nowhere.
AID00099316	Another caravan burned. Except someone made camp here - and I never heard about this attack.
AID00099317	Let's look around, something stinks.
AID00099318	That does it, that's all I need to know.
AID00099319	Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs... they were behind burning these caravans, and they've got to answer for them.
AID00099320	I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
AID00099321	Voices down, eyes up.
AID00099322	Keep your voice down, we got movement out there.
AID00099323	Save the sweettalk for when the shooting's done.
AID00099324	You and me we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
AID00099325	I thought there was a chance you'd change - not any longer, being a fucker is who you are.
AID00099326	Guess my last warning didn't sink in too well. Things don't change, and soon, I'm gone.
AID00099327	You are such an asshole sometimes.
AID00099328	Look, maybe you were like this before I signed up with you, but if you keep acting this way, I'm not going to stick around much longer.
AID00099329	Are you fucking high right now? God, I can smell it from here. Keep that shit away from me.
AID00099330	Ready to leave yet? This place puts my teeth on edge.
AID00099331	Well, now, look what rolled in. What, you getting lonely out there?
AID00099332	If you say you're going to gather evidence, then kill the bitches anyway, at least tell me when you change your mind.
AID00099333	Now, if you're done fucking around, let's settle accounts the old-fashioned way.
AID00099334	Just trimmed the Van Graff family tree, I think Freeside'll breathe a little easier now.
AID00099335	And that's it for the Crimson Caravan.
AID00099336	Well, that's settled... I suppose.
AID00099337	You find any "evidence" yet? I'm not going to wait forever.
AID00099338	Well, now that I'm free of the Outpost, was wondering if you'd mind making a detour.
AID00099339	I'd like to pay my respects to the end of Cassidy Caravans, check out the site where they died.
AID00099340	We find this "friend" of yours, looking forward to adding some red to that checkered suit of his.
AID00099341	Why the hell we wandering so much anyway? Nothing against the Mojave except the dust, heat, and scorpions, but...
AID00099342	We find this "friend" Benny of yours, looking forward to rattling his cage.
AID00099343	Never thought I'd pass the Vegas wall. Never seen so many lights in one place before.
AID00099344	Howdy, pardner! Doesn't look like you've brought back the Platinum Chip!
AID00099345	Why don't you mosey on back to wherever it is you left Benny cooling off? Come back when you got it.
AID00099346	Sorry, pardner, but the boss ain't available to take a meeting!
AID00099347	Howdy, pardner! Good to see you again!
AID00099348	Congratulations, pardner! The boss has instructed me to comp you to the High-Roller Suite!
AID00099349	You can bring your friends, too! Be like a little clubhouse for the gang you put together!
AID00099350	Just bear in mind, you're the only one gets to see the boss! Any friends you got, they can wait in the suite.
AID00099351	Enjoy the digs, pardner! They're plenty fancy!
AID00099352	What floor, pardner?
AID00099353	Where to, pardner?
AID00099354	Which floor, now?
AID00099355	Penthouse floor!
AID00099356	Cocktail lounge!
AID00099357	High-roller suite!
AID00099358	Casino floor!
AID00099359	B2! Physical Plant!
AID00099360	B2! Facilities Management!
AID00099361	Sorry, pardner, if you're heading for the penthouse, you gotta go alone.
AID00099362	You low-down snake! I wish I'd have left you in the ground to rot!
AID00099363	Draw!
AID00099364	Hey, hey! Look who has the hot hands? Here, have something special on the house.
AID00099365	Looks like someone is on a roll. Luck be a lady tonight. Here's a little something from the Family.
AID00099366	You keep on spending money in here. You gotta give us a chance to win something back. Here's something nice for you.
AID00099367	Ok, that's that. No more games for you. Go rob the Tops. You're done here.
AID00099368	Have some drinks, talk to some dancers but you are done at my tables.
AID00099369	Hnh - didn't even hear you come up the ramp. You don't broadcast your movements. I like that.
AID00099370	Hnh. Heard your footsteps coming up the ramp, didn't sound like a trooper or one of the merchants.
AID00099371	You a Courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
AID00099372	Well, that's a start. But I don't reckon you came to me to learn to fight sarsaparilla bottles.
AID00099373	Tell you what. I gotta go chase geckos away from our water supply anyway. Darn critters are attracted to it. Why don't you come along?
AID00099374	Thank goodness you're here. My squad needs help.
AID00099375	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.
AID00099376	Change your mind? Offer's still open, lot of smoke from Nipton in the East, could use a set of eyes over there.
AID00099377	You check out the Nipton Town Hall yet? Smoke trail's not getting any shorter.
AID00099378	Thanks for the assist. Wish others around here had your drive.
AID00099379	You a Courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
AID00099380	Jimmy? Little Jimmy - my, how you're grown up. So good of you to come visit your grandma.
AID00099381	Well, well. If it isn't the courier who wiped out the Legion over at Nelson. Good to see you around the Hope.
AID00099382	Hold up there. This area is locked down by the NCR military until we can dislodge some Legion snakes from Nelson.
AID00099383	Me and Carmine - that's my repeater here - will do our best to cover you from this ridge. Good luck.
AID00099384	Let it wait until I've stopped running, all right?
AID00099385	Hold it right there, Courier. I been hearing things about you, and they ain't all been good.
AID00099386	Just so you know, you will answer to me if you cause any trouble for the troops around here. Things're bad enough as is.
AID00099387	You're always welcome around the Hope, Courier - least as far as I'm concerned.
AID00099388	Howdy. What's the word?
AID00099389	I can still hear our boys screaming down there.
AID00099390	Well howdy.
AID00099391	Not sure who this friend of yours is, but if he's looking down on Vegas, he's either God or the moon.
AID00099392	Not one for being subtle, are you? The Tops probably never saw so much action 'til you charged in.
AID00099393	So glad you iced that little fucker. Anyone that wears a suit like that... well, they're asking for bullets.
AID00099394	So what, we chase that little cocksucker down or what? He's got to stop running sometime, and that's when we'll get him.
AID00099395	So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow-bricked road, and there's bad news at the end.
AID00099396	What, did... did you put a plug in his cocktube to make him explode?
AID00099397	First Vegas, now NCR and Legion? You're being courted more than a Redding widow.
AID00099398	Hope you can answer them politely, or there's no safe place in the Mojave for you.
AID00099399	Still looking for a place to pitch your tent? NCR, Legion, or Vegas, seems like each of them's a beartrap, no matter where you put your foot.
AID00099400	Careful where you flash that chip of yours... not sure what kind of caps it's worth, but it's a tempting target.
AID00099401	Nothing like turning a snake's trap on itself. That Benny's a slippery fucker, but you one-upped him, all right.
AID00099402	Can't tell you how glad I am you butchered the Fiends. Caravans across the wastes are going to be buying you drinks for years.
AID00099403	Inside the Lucky 38? Not sure whether that's a blessing or a curse.
AID00099404	Sure hope you know what you're doing, Mojave's getting tense.
AID00099405	Don't get me wrong, NCR needs the help... sometimes I wish they'd step up more on their own. Not sure saving them helps them in the long run.
AID00099406	Sure hope you know what throwing in with the Legion means. Helping them running roughshod over the West is an Old World kind of cruel.
AID00099407	If someone promised me all the lights of Vegas, I'd consider it, too... but I wouldn't say yes until I saw what was behind the curtain.
AID00099408	Mojave's almost buzzing like a Cazador now... must be all the blood Legion and NCR are spilling over the Colorado.
AID00099409	Guess there's no turning back now, it's war. If Hoover Dam's where it's going to go down, better make it count.
AID00099410	Looking for trouble?
AID00099411	You come around like a bad habit. What's on your mind?
AID00099412	What's on your mind?
AID00099413	Oh, you look like you got something else to say besides ordering me around.
AID00099414	Let's hear it, you look all serious.
AID00099415	Something to say to me other than guns, distance, and stimming?
AID00099416	Whoa, why you leaning in all of a sudden?
AID00099417	Ask 'em then.
AID00099418	<Storage Node for Jackson Variable: Do not Translate.>
AID00099419	<Storage Node for High Level Topics: Do Not Translate>
AID00099420	I don't know what it was brought you to Primm, youngster, but you might want to rethink your plans. Town's gone to hell.
AID00099421	You got that old robot up and running again? How is it working out for you?
AID00099422	Hey, youngster. Still hanging about Primm, huh?
AID00099423	Baby, this little meet and greet of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
AID00099424	It would be 41 flavors of stupid to let you get a drop on me. And you've caused plenty enough trouble as-is.
AID00099425	You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
AID00099426	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099427	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies...
AID00099428	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099429	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099430	Hello! The guy everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
AID00099431	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099432	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099433	Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Shit.
AID00099434	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099435	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099436	Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
AID00099437	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099438	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099439	Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
AID00099440	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099441	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099442	Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
AID00099443	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099444	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AID00099445	Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
AID00099446	Benny is gonna show you the Tops! I hope you're built sturdy, you crazy broad!
AID00099447	What in the goddamn...?
AID00099448	You? How could you be...? Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
AID00099449	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. We should be working together.
AID00099450	Hey hey hey, what the hell...?
AID00099451	Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
AID00099452	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. It's like I said, we should be working together.
AID00099453	I comped you the prez so we can talk there, hey? No need to keep tugging at my sleeve.
AID00099454	Wait until we get to the Presidential, pally. I don't need you tugging at my sleeve.
AID00099455	Cool by me if you wanna talk after all... but a confab like this, out in public, in my place of business? That don't play.
AID00099456	What say you and me cash out, go somewheres more private-like? Any questions you got, I'll answer.
AID00099457	Like I said, we should be talking somewheres private.
AID00099458	Now that you and me's got some privacy, I gotta ask - how is it that you're still living?
AID00099459	Once you were vertical, how'd you track me down?
AID00099460	I guess that's enough scratching around at first base. Tell me, which way is the wind gonna blow?
AID00099461	You got questions, I got answers.
AID00099462	The store is currently unavailable due to unexpected circumstances. Please come back later.
AID00099463	Welcome, sir or madam. Do you wish to purchase something?
AID00099464	Yeah! Who won the lottery? I did!
AID00099465	Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like booze!
AID00099466	Stop bothering me, will ya! I won the fucking lottery!
AID00099467	Fuck off! Win your own fucking lottery!
AID00099468	Hello again. How's your Boomer friend?
AID00099469	Have you spoken with McLafferty yet?
AID00099470	You tried to get me killed. Get the hell out of my face.
AID00099471	I'm on my way to meet that Boomer you told me about!
AID00099472	Thank you for getting me here. Jack is a great guy.
AID00099473	Hey there! Here's the rest of the payment I promised you back in Goodsprings.
AID00099474	This is my room, now you get the fuck out before you get yourself hurt.
AID00099475	I warned you, now it is time to eat hot fucking lead.
AID00099476	Get the fuck out of my room.
AID00099477	I thought I told you to get the fuck out of here.
AID00099478	Hey, thanks for all the hard work back there. I'm going to run a tight ship here, don't you worry.
AID00099479	Any word on Station Charlie?
AID00099480	Howdy, pardner! Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company. Wrangle up a stool and listen to ol' Festus jaw a while.
AID00099481	If you and ol' Festus are old pals, say a command now. Otherwise, say "Pleased to meetcha" and we'll get acquainted.
AID00099482	Or, if you have more important things to do than talk to ol' Festus, say "Goodbye".
AID00099483	Welcome to the Dino Bite Gift Shop. My name's Cliff. If you're here for the t-rex figurines, you're just in time. There's still a few left.
AID00099484	Welcome back. Please don't kill me. I'll give you a real nice price on everything.
AID00099485	I don't know if you know, but since Jeannie May passed, I've been keeping an eye on her properties for her.
AID00099486	I think it's time we gave something back to you, so take this key and make yourself at home at our motel.
AID00099487	It'll open the room on the second floor, closest to the lobby. Hope it suits you.
AID00099488	So I heard you helped take over Nelson from the Legion. Glad to see someone making a difference around here instead of just complaining.
AID00099489	Thanks again for finding those supplies. I've already started putting them to good use.
AID00099490	If it isn't the guy that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
AID00099491	If it isn't the gal that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
AID00099492	I can't believe that President Kimball is dead. If I could get my hands on the people that did this I'd rip their heads off with my bare hands.
AID00099493	I can't believe someone tried to assassinate President Kimball. I'm just glad he's still alive. We need a guy like him around.
AID00099494	Are you new? No one told me about any new troops showing up. This is just great, we get new troops and no new supplies for them.
AID00099495	I didn't expect someone as famous as you here. What can I do for you?
AID00099496	Nice to see a friendly face around here. We don't get many visitors of your esteem. Something I can do for you?
AID00099497	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any crazy shit.
AID00099498	Didn't expect someone like you around here. What do you want?
AID00099499	You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You better get out before I throw you out.
AID00099500	What do you want?
AID00099501	If it isn't the guy that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
AID00099502	If it isn't the gal that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
AID00099503	Whoa, didn't you save President Kimball? Glad to have someone like you here!
AID00099504	I heard President Kimball almost got killed at Hoover Dam. That would have been a big blow to morale around here.
AID00099505	Did you hear President Kimball was killed? The guys here aren't taking it very well.
AID00099506	New guy, eh? The more the merrier around here!
AID00099507	New gal, eh? The more the merrier around here!
AID00099508	Hey everybody, look who it is! Glad to have you here friend. What can I do for you?
AID00099509	Look who we have here. Always nice to see a friend of the NCR. What can I do for you?
AID00099510	You're not going to do anything crazy here, are you?
AID00099511	Uh... is there something I can help you with?
AID00099512	Hey, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here.
AID00099513	What brings someone like you here?
AID00099514	Go away, human.
AID00099515	
AID00099516	
AID00099517	Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
AID00099518	Since you convinced me to help out with the defense of Hoover Dam, I figured I'd haul it out of storage.
AID00099519	I'm a little rusty with it but... I think I can manage. As long as you've got my back, of course.
AID00099520	Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
AID00099521	I thought I might wear it at Hoover Dam, but after you talked me out of it, I didn't see the point in hanging on to it any longer.
AID00099522	I'm here because of you, so I figure you're the one most deserving of it. It should protect you from everything short of a Plasma Caster.
AID00099523	And if you need anything - anything at all - you know where to find me.
AID00099524	Hey there. Was it always your plan to sell me into slavery to Caesar, or was that a spur of the moment thing?
AID00099525	Why don't you make like Odysseus and get lost?
AID00099526	For as lack of adornment is said to become some women, so will this place, without your presence, bring delight.
AID00099527	I've run out of witty ways to tell you to leave, so why don't you just go?
AID00099528	If you want to talk, take off that ridiculous Legion uniform. It's insulting.
AID00099529	Hi. If you're looking for medical help, try the other doctors. I'm just a researcher. Not even a particularly good one.
AID00099530	Hello, again. Still in one piece, I see.
AID00099531	What's up?
AID00099532	Well, we've had some laughs, you and I, but it looks like you're a crazy person and I'm going to have to leave.
AID00099533	Moreno took the fall of the Enclave hard. He never questioned his orders, never questioned the legitimacy of what the Enclave was doing.
AID00099534	To him, it was all one unbroken chain, from Washington to Richardson. When we left Navarro, I remember looking up at Moreno.
AID00099535	He said, "Kiss America goodbye, boys." When we left the Enclave behind, the love in him burned itself out. Now there's just a bitter old man left.
AID00099536	Since my mother died, Daisy's been the only woman in my life. She was the only other woman close to my father, too.
AID00099537	She flew him out on over a dozen missions, including his last. I've always been close to Daisy.
AID00099538	There have been some good men along the way, but lovers make poor confidants. Daisy never had children of her own, so she was always there to listen.
AID00099539	Being in the Enclave didn't mean much to her. She just loved to fly. It broke her heart to be grounded.
AID00099540	Doc Henry always was a hard one to figure out. It didn't seem to matter whether he was working with humans or dogs.
AID00099541	He had an equal lack of affection for both. A regular Diogenes. I'm not sure what the man was after.
AID00099542	"Knowledge is power," but to what end for Henry, I have no idea. The problem was what mattered to him, not its practical impact.
AID00099543	He simply solved riddles because they existed.
AID00099544	If I had to pick anyone who didn't belong in the Enclave, it would definitely be Johnson. He hated what the Enclave was doing.
AID00099545	Day to day, week to week, he would question orders, subvert mission objectives, do anything he could to serve without serving.
AID00099546	It's amazing he was never court-martialed. He always had good things to say about my father. Said I was like him in a lot of ways. I wish I knew.
AID00099547	Judah Kreger is the glue that's kept us all together over the years, and with good reason.
AID00099548	Anyone who can command Moreno and Johnson in the same unit without somebody getting fragged is one hell of a leader.
AID00099549	Kreger was polite and kind, but never warm. He always did his best to make me feel welcome in the group.
AID00099550	I think he did it out of a sense of loyalty to my father. Loyalty means a lot to Judah.
AID00099551	Not loyalty to the Enclave, or even the ideals they fought for, but to the people who served with him.
AID00099552	I'd like to say that I saw this coming, but honestly I was oblivious. For what it's worth, I'll do what I can to help you... not get killed?
AID00099553	So Mr. House doesn't care that one of Caesar's most notorious Legion spies is walking around on the Strip.
AID00099554	Either that or his Securitrons' AI is too primitive to recognize the threat. Neither answer is particularly comforting.
AID00099555	Oh, hello Emily. Yes, it is I, Arcade Gannon, fellow member of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00099556	Would I like to help infiltrate the Lucky 38? I'm so glad you asked...
AID00099557	That's a lot of energy weapons. Brings back some interesting memories.
AID00099558	The Strip's not a bad place if you love terrible things and people. I'll never understand the allure of giving away your money to the rich.
AID00099559	I've read about REPCONN. I think they did some work with the...  the government before the war. Rockets and some energy weapon prototypes, I think.
AID00099560	Westside, huh? I passed through here with another Follower a while back, Anderson. The locals were having a lot of trouble getting water through.
AID00099561	Westside, huh? I heard about what happened with Anderson. Can't say I'm surprised. He was always a fringe operator in the Followers.
AID00099562	What's wrong with you? Killing Anderson isn't going to bring Corporal White back.
AID00099563	Interesting way of handling things. Very sub rosa.
AID00099564	I don't know if the Scorpions deserved to be wiped out for something they didn't do, but that's one less problem Westside has to deal with.
AID00099565	Anderson turned in for the wrong reason and Westside gets to keep siphoning water.
AID00099566	It's hard to find justice in all of this, but I suppose this is as close as it gets. Thanks.
AID00099567	Extortion? Really? You go through all of this only to extort the people who are trying to help Westside? Unbelievable.
AID00099568	Hildern is a good example of "big picture" obsession gone too far.
AID00099569	At some point he became so fixated on large scale results that he lost the concept of "the common good" along the way.
AID00099570	It's an inhumane kind of public service when people and the basic resources they need become numbers in a ledger.
AID00099571	A vertibird. Interesting. It's been a long time since I've seen one of these.
AID00099572	Wait, wait, wait a second. What's going on? Am I playing Vergil to your Dante?
AID00099573	I'd like to assume that we're tiptoeing into the mouth of hell out of academic curiosity, but I'm not so open-minded that I've lost my brains.
AID00099574	I guess I'll wait out here, then.
AID00099575	I need to talk to you about something, if you have a minute.
AID00099576	Thanks for doing this, getting them all back together again.
AID00099577	I'll be honest, when Moreno started going off, I didn't think we'd all be walking out of there in one piece.
AID00099578	I still don't know how this is all going to shake out in the end, but at least the Enclave can atone a bit for all the damage it's done.
AID00099579	I shouldn't be surprised at what happened with Moreno. I hoped that after all this time, he could put his anger behind him.
AID00099580	Maybe everything good in Orion Moreno died at Navarro and it was foolish to think there was anything in him left to salvage.
AID00099581	You got the survivors of the Enclave back together so you could convince them to help Caesar?!
AID00099582	What are you thinking? Do you want to see Vegas turned into the new slave capital of the west?
AID00099583	Hey. You're your own person and all that, but you're acting crazy, and if you keep it up, I'm going to leave.
AID00099584	I like how you handled that. Nicely done.
AID00099585	I can't say that's how I would have handled that, but...
AID00099586	You're that courier, right? The guy who runs the Tops, Benny... heard he tried to kill you.
AID00099587	I guess that didn't work out very well for him. Should I watch my back around you?
AID00099588	Oh, you're that courier, aren't you? The one who got mixed up with Benny over at the Tops. Sounds like messy business.
AID00099589	I'm no botanist, but I think this may not be entirely natural.
AID00099590	Nuclear waste disposal. Pre-War, people figured there was so much desert in Nevada, you might as well turn it into a big dumping ground.
AID00099591	People didn't like it, but they weren't about to give up easy access to power, not with all of the petroleum drying up.
AID00099592	It's a shame what happened up here. I understand arguments about the "fog of war", but that can't be much consolation to the survivors.
AID00099593	Or to the NCR soldiers who have to live with what they did here.
AID00099594	In case it's not obvious, I think you should redirect the power to Freeside and outer Vegas.
AID00099595	You activated ARCHIMEDES?! What the hell are you thinking?!
AID00099596	Nicely done. I'm sure people will appreciate the power. I hate to have to rely on it, but out here... it makes a big difference.
AID00099597	Hmm. I suppose an even distribution is better than nothing.
AID00099598	Everything to the Strip and McCarran? Are you kidding? 
AID00099599	I guess I should be grateful you didn't activate the laser.
AID00099600	You have to hand it to the NCR. Get enough hands working together and they can make or break just about anything.
AID00099601	I'm not exactly a mercenary, but taking out scumbags of this magnitude wouldn't cause me to lose any sleep.
AID00099602	Well, I'll be. Hoover Dam. One of the last remaining functioning wonders of the Pre-War world.
AID00099603	I'm amazed it's still running at all. Too bad everyone's killing each other over it.
AID00099604	What a load of Brahmin shit! Can you believe that guy?
AID00099605	Hey hey, fella, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
AID00099606	Hey hey, baby doll, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
AID00099607	Welcome back to the Tops. Anything I can do for you?
AID00099608	Enjoying your stay?
AID00099609	
AID00099610	Hold up! There are Deathclaws all over the damn place north of here. I'd turn back if I were you.
AID00099611	If you want to get to New Vegas, you're better off heading east from Primm and then looping north. It's a heck of a lot safer.
AID00099612	Can't believe anyone actually made it through from the north, what with all the Deathclaws at the quarry. You returning from New Vegas?
AID00099613	You need something?
AID00099614	Let me ask you a question - what's the tastiest thing you've ever eaten?
AID00099615	This is incredibly good. Here's your omelet, and the recipe if you ever want to make your own. It takes a bit of skill to get it tasting right.
AID00099616	Hey there. What's new?
AID00099617	That's close enough. What do you want with the Great Khans?
AID00099618	Nice outfit, but I know you're not one of us. What do you want with the Great Khans?
AID00099619	What do you want now?
AID00099620	How's it going?
AID00099621	Hey, hey. What can Tyrone do for you?
AID00099622	I had an amazing time with you. You can look me up any time, baby.
AID00099623	Hey, hey. You're back.
AID00099624	<whuff>
AID00099625	<snuffle!>
AID00099626	You've done a good turn for the NCR and now we'd like to do one for you - here's an NCR emergency two-way radio - you call and we'll come running.
AID00099627	You're not alone out here - the NCR has your back. Stay safe and good hunting.
AID00099628	Yeah?
AID00099629	My word, but that was a lot of chopping at that casino, dear.
AID00099630	Naughty children run from their punishment, but we'll find Benny, won't we Leo?
AID00099631	Heavens to Betsy, but Mr. Benny met a nasty end. I hope you've realized, pumpkin, that crime doesn't pay.
AID00099632	My, but that Lucky 38 is a large building. And so fancy!
AID00099633	Leo doesn't like that you left that House man alive, dearie. He thinks you should have let us chop him.
AID00099634	You should have heard Leo, sweetie. He laughed and laughed when that old man in the box exploded.
AID00099635	Leo thinks there will be lots more chopping to do now that Caesar is dead. I do hope you'll be careful, pumpkin.
AID00099636	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, rescuing the President like that!
AID00099637	Now sweetie, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That goes for learning to ride bikes and killing Presidents!
AID00099638	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, assassinating the President like that!
AID00099639	Leo's very grumpy, pumpkin. He wanted to chop the President!
AID00099640	Look at you, sweetness! Blowing up a robot army all by yourself, isn't that precious?
AID00099641	Grandma's so worried about her little baby! It's getting dangerous out there in the Wasteland!
AID00099642	Leo's getting more and more agitated, sweetie. I think he can smell the fight coming.
AID00099643	I hope you're not thinking about rushing off to that big dam, pumpkin! It's sure to be very dangerous!
AID00099644	Hello again, dear.
AID00099645	Hello again, dear.
AID00099646	Welcome to The Tops. How can I help you?
AID00099647	Humbly at your service.
AID00099648	Please, ma'am - take pity on us. Free us, I'm begging you!
AID00099649	Please, sir - take pity on us. Free us, please!
AID00099650	That business at the Tops could never happen here. We don't admit that sort of riff-raff.
AID00099651	I know Benny was murdered, but if you ask me, the real crime was that checkered jacket.
AID00099652	A little bird told me Benny might be gone for good. He must've been in some delightful scandal to have run off so suddenly.
AID00099653	Those Omertas. Always plotting, never relevant. Bravo for putting them in their place like that.
AID00099654	Word has it you were spotted entering the Lucky 38. How ever did you get on that guest list?
AID00099655	Is it me or do the Securitrons seem... sassier?
AID00099656	Such a shame about Mr. House. He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
AID00099657	There's a rumor going around that you killed Caesar! I'm dying to know... is it true? That he used a hairpiece, I mean?
AID00099658	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
AID00099659	The Kings will be missed. Not by me, of course. But who will buy the food at the Tops now that no one needs it to grease their hair?
AID00099660	It sounds like the Kings made nice with the NCR in Freeside. Seems there was room for two flies on the same bit of dung after all.
AID00099661	What do you need tested?
AID00099662	What happened at Black Mountain?
AID00099663	What happened to Raul?
AID00099664	What happened with the Boomers?
AID00099665	What happened to the Brotherhood of Steel?
AID00099666	What happened to Veronica?
AID00099667	What happened to the Fiends?
AID00099668	What happened to the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00099669	What happened to Arcade?
AID00099670	What happened to Goodsprings?
AID00099671	What happened to Cass?
AID00099672	What happened with the Great Khans?
AID00099673	What happened with Jacobstown?
AID00099674	What happened to Lily?
AID00099675	What happened with the Kings?
AID00099676	What happened to Rex?
AID00099677	What happened to the Misfits?
AID00099678	What happened at Novac?
AID00099679	What happened to Boone?
AID00099680	What happened to the Vault 19 Powder Gang?
AID00099681	What happened at Primm?
AID00099682	What happened to ED-E?
AID00099683	What happened with Chief Hanlon?
AID00099684	What happened with the Enclave Remnants?
AID00099685	What happened at the NCRF?
AID00099686	When will we be free?
AID00099687	I can't ever thank you enough for saving me and mine! We're free now!
AID00099688	You're a killer. Go away.
AID00099689	We're being held here against our will! I beg you, help us!
AID00099690	Are you going to free us, or what?
AID00099691	Thank you. We never would've escaped without your help.
AID00099692	At least I'm free to bury my kin.
AID00099693	You killed my kin. Why is this happening to me?
AID00099694	Oh, it's just awful here. Can't you help us?
AID00099695	You're still gonna free us, aren't you?
AID00099696	Thank you so much for freeing me!
AID00099697	You looking for a pat on the back? My mother is dead.
AID00099698	Caesar may have deemed you worthy to bear his mark, but your reputation preceeds you.
AID00099699	Your presence will be tolerated, but you are not welcome here. Lucullus awaits you on the docks.
AID00099700	Do not make Caesar wait! Lucullus awaits you on the dock.
AID00099701	A Profligate bearing the Mark of Caesar? What is the world coming to?
AID00099702	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you with the barge at the docks. He will take you to The Fort to speak with Caesar.
AID00099703	Get moving, Profligate! Do not make Caesar wait!
AID00099704	Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
AID00099705	You taught Severus well! Soon I'll wear a necklace of Profligates' toes, blown off by their own mines!
AID00099706	Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
AID00099707	Yes? Name your concern.
AID00099708	You've heard the news about President Kimball? If I got my hands on the traitor that killed him....
AID00099709	So now it's come to open assassination attempts against the President? Hard to believe.
AID00099710	Thank God. Please tell me you're here to relieve me.
AID00099711	Never expected someone as famous as you to turn up here. What can I do for you?
AID00099712	I've been sending requests for relief for months now. Didn't think they'd send you, though.
AID00099713	 I really hope you're not here to cause trouble.
AID00099714	Oh. I've heard of you. What do you want?
AID00099715	I'll give you this, you've got a lot of guts just walking in here like this.
AID00099716	What do you want?
AID00099717	If this isn't a crisis situation, you'd better have a damn good reason for interrupting me.
AID00099718	Anything else I can do for you?
AID00099719	Sharing knowledge with an outsider organization. I knew Veronica couldn't be trusted.
AID00099720	We tracked your movements a long way. But it was worth it to catch her in the act.
AID00099721	Passing Brotherhood secrets to outsiders is the lowest form of treason. What have you got to say for yourself?
AID00099722	We heard Veronica talking with the Elder. We won't stand for this.
AID00099723	What is this? Veronica brings an outsider into our home, then has a private audience with the Elder?
AID00099724	The two of you may have the Elder fooled, but we know better.
AID00099725	Veronica has always twisted the Founder's principles to her own ends. We will not stand idly by and allow her to corrupt our Elder's thinking.
AID00099726	Leave me alone.
AID00099727	Hey, you got a second?
AID00099728	I'd slap him around, but he stood at my parents' wedding.
AID00099729	Plus he used to make excuses to get me out of my punishment when I'd slept through Head Scribe Taggart's lectures. Figure I owe him for that.
AID00099730	<Sighs> He means well.
AID00099731	I'd be angrier with him, but it's hard to stay mad at the guy who taught me how to box when all the other Paladins told me no.
AID00099732	<Sighs> He always does what he feels is right. Usually that's a great quality.
AID00099733	Let's see what we've got here... Okay, yeah, this is the one I was thinking of. The pulse gun.
AID00099734	Although maybe the rangefinder could work too. And it looks like the NCR was onto some miracle farming technology.
AID00099735	He wouldn't listen. The truth was right there staring him in the face. How could he not listen?
AID00099736	God. I should get used to this, I guess. People get desperate, they turn on each other. First thing to go is trust.
AID00099737	I don't think it's ever gonna be the same for me in there. Knowing no matter what I do, it's gonna end badly.
AID00099738	But they're all I have.
AID00099739	God, I did this. This was my fault. Why didn't I see this coming?
AID00099740	Of course they'd track me. Of course they'd assume the worst. Sure, I left them. But that didn't mean I'd ever be free of them.
AID00099741	I should've known I was beaten before I began. I just... I had to try, you know?
AID00099742	Well, if there was any question whether I should leave, I guess there's my answer.
AID00099743	Why did you do that? They were going to let us walk away. Why did you attack them?
AID00099744	I don't care that they started it. What you did was inexcusable. You need to go.
AID00099745	Clearly you're determined to fight the Brotherhood. Well, you can add my name to your hit list because you're on your own.
AID00099746	Okay, listen. The Brotherhood... they're not always the friendliest bunch. But I won't stand for you fighting them.
AID00099747	This is your last chance.
AID00099748	See? Pretty addictive, right? You do it once, it just makes you want to do it more.
AID00099749	You can't help but notice that the Brotherhood barely exists to these people out here. We're like an urban myth. No real presence on the Outside.
AID00099750	We just don't adapt like we should. Used to be that all you needed to get your way was a suit of power armor and a laser rifle.
AID00099751	Now... people are armed and organized. They're not afraid. But we still stick to our old approach, because it's all we know.
AID00099752	You know, I've been thinking. The real problem with the Brotherhood is that we isolate ourselves.
AID00099753	Our training is top-notch, our technology gives us an advantage, but when it all comes down to it, we're losing because we shun the outside world.
AID00099754	We always make enemies, never allies. We refuse to recruit outsiders, or see the value in their simpler technologies.
AID00099755	Hold on. I see something I want to punch.
AID00099756	No offense, but you look like you've traveled a long way down some bad roads. Where'd you come from?
AID00099757	Couldn't get enough of talking to me the first time, huh?
AID00099758	Listen... I want to thank you for helping me out. I'm sorry that... things didn't go like I'd hoped.
AID00099759	But at least I got the chance to try. At least I know for sure that there was nothing I could do.
AID00099760	Thank you for giving me that chance.
AID00099761	Wow, Mr. House is looking for you, huh? What do you think he wants? Bowling partner?
AID00099762	What'd you think of Mr. House? I was surprised he only had the two robot sex slaves.
AID00099763	That chip of yours... I wouldn't wager it on blackjack.
AID00099764	Unless the dealer has a five or six showing.
AID00099765	Whole future of New Vegas seems like it's up in the air. Guess I should wait things out before buying a condo in the Ultra-Luxe, huh?
AID00099766	Hope you're picking the winning side here. Be nice to fight for someone who's gonna be around for a while.
AID00099767	Next stop, Hoover Dam, huh? When we get there... can we stop by the souvenir shop? Their beaver mascot is just precious.
AID00099768	What's up?
AID00099769	
AID00099770	<bark! bark!>
AID00099771	<growl...>
AID00099772	<aroo!>
AID00099773	<whimper>
AID00099774	<happy bark!>
AID00099775	<pant pant pant>
AID00099776	Get you a drink?
AID00099777	If you're looking for supplies I'll make this easy for you... there aren't any.
AID00099778	But something tells me you're not here for that. What do you want?
AID00099779	I've told you Powder Gangers everything I know! Please don't hit me anymore!
AID00099780	Looks like you've hit a lucky streak there. You must be thirsty by now - here, have a drink on the house and keep on playing!
AID00099781	Well look at that! You aren't a Powder Ganger after all. I'd suggest against wearing that outfit around the townsfolk. You may get shot by accident.
AID00099782	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me?
AID00099783	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me? I'd cross my fingers but my hands are numb.
AID00099784	I apologize, wanderer, but I must go tend to my flock!
AID00099785	I waited to speak with you one last time before I descended to the launch pad, wanderer.
AID00099786	I want you to know that we will remember for all eternity how you delivered us to the threshold of the Great Journey.
AID00099787	Our preparations are nearly complete, but the rockets that will carry us to salvation are yet missing vital components.
AID00099788	If you would still help us, wanderer, speak to Chris. He can tell you what is missing.
AID00099789	There is no way that we can thank you enough, wanderer. Your arrival here was a blessing. We will remember you always.
AID00099790	Forgive me, wanderer, but my flock awaits.
AID00099791	Is the way clear?
AID00099792	Will you help us, wanderer?
AID00099793	The NCR takes care of its own - so in thanks for your service to the Republic... here's one of our emergency two-way radios.
AID00099794	You call and we'll come running. If you're too far from an NCR outpost there won't be much we can do for you...
AID00099795	but then the NCR is just about everywhere these days. Good luck and stay safe out there.
AID00099796	For your service, beyond the call of duty, the NCR would like to award you with this emergency two-way radio.
AID00099797	You call and we'll send you any support we can spare. Keep up the good work, soldier.
AID00099798	The NCR would like to thank you for your service. If you ever need us, just call and we'll come running.
AID00099799	The NCR takes care of its own... and its supporters. Stay safe out there and call us if you get in a jam.
AID00099800	Coordinates for supply cache in your region being sent... now.
AID00099801	Received - updating map marker for local NCR supply cache.
AID00099802	This is NCR Operator - message received - sending map marker for local supply cache.
AID00099803	How is your visit with us going, stranger?
AID00099804	You have done well to earn the trust of my people, child.
AID00099805	Hello, friend. How can Mother Pearl be of help today?
AID00099806	So you're the outsider. Lived your whole life out there, huh? Wow.
AID00099807	I always thought you savages probably spoke a different language, but I hear you sound like us.
AID00099808	Thank you for getting Janet to Nellis. I've never been so happy in my entire life!
AID00099809	This has been a dream come true to work on the Lady. I don't think I've seen Loyal this frisky in years.
AID00099810	I've never been so happy in my entire life!
AID00099811	Have you seen her? The redhead of my dreams?
AID00099812	Hi! I can't believe I'm going to meet my red-headed lady soon! I'm really nervous about it!
AID00099813	Go to hell, outsider. Stay away from me.
AID00099814	You're a terrible person! I loved her! And you let her run right into our killzone. Why didn't you stop her?
AID00099815	Hey there. Back for more?
AID00099816	Whoa there, pal. You better slow down, or you'll get blown up like the rest of the idiots who thought they'd scavenge in Boomer territory.
AID00099817	Now that I've got your attention, might you be interested in a little information? It'll cost you, but it's well worth the investment.
AID00099818	Welcome back. Have you reconsidered my offer?
AID00099819	I told you what you need to know. Now get moving!
AID00099820	Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! You're the first one to make it through alive, let alone manage a return trip!
AID00099821	That was pretty incredible. I've never seen anyone come out of the Boomer's rain of death alive before.
AID00099822	Hey there lady! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
AID00099823	Hey there mister! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
AID00099824	Hi again! Have you found Mister Cuddles?
AID00099825	Thanks again for finding Mister Cuddles! You're the best!
AID00099826	I can't believe Mister Cuddles is gone.
AID00099827	Pearl sent word saying it's all right to tell you about the Lady in the water.
AID00099828	Isn't that bomber a beauty? Thanks so much for making an old man's dreams come true.
AID00099829	It's going to be a dream come true once you've raised that bomber from Lake Mead!
AID00099830	Good work with those solar arrays.
AID00099831	I hope Pearl knows what she's doing, letting you wander around Nellis as you please.
AID00099832	What is it, Outsider?
AID00099833	Hello, Outsider, need something?
AID00099834	I'll take this from here!
AID00099835	I'm Raquel, Master-At-Arms for the Nellis homeland. Mother Pearl, our Eldest, wishes to speak to you.
AID00099836	Hello, friend. 
AID00099837	Mother Pearl's instructions are clear. You can move freely around Nellis, and artillery spotters have orders not to fire on you.
AID00099838	These are extraordinary privileges. Don't abuse them.
AID00099839	What is it, savage?
AID00099840	What's the situation with the giant ants?
AID00099841	I see the power's back on. The ants are all dead?
AID00099842	What is it, Outsider?
AID00099843	I know Mother Pearl is letting you wander Nellis as you please, Outsider, but I have patients to tend to.
AID00099844	If I haven't said it before, Outsider, let me say it now - welcome to Nellis. Word from Pearl is that you're to be greeted as a friend.
AID00099845	You raised the Lady from the Lake! The future is looking up. How can I help you, Outsider?
AID00099846	Yes, Outsider?
AID00099847	Woah! You're the outsider! What are you doing here?
AID00099848	Hey! Do they have any toys outside of here? I sure could use something fun.
AID00099849	Roar! I'm a dinosaur!
AID00099850	This is mission control, ready for liftoff. What's your 5 by 5?
AID00099851	Halt! You must pay the toll to pass!
AID00099852	Put up your dukes! I'm the Red-Brick Kid!
AID00099853	I am La Fantoma! I will fly to the side of injustice!
AID00099854	You're back. When you walked off in the middle of our people's story, I thought you must be bored.
AID00099855	You killed Mother Pearl! Get out of here, outsider!
AID00099856	You killed Loyal! Get out of here, outsider!
AID00099857	You're the outsider! Mother Pearl sent word that you'd be stopping by. You must be eager to hear the story of our people!
AID00099858	I heard about what you've done around here, and I have nothing to say to you, outsider.
AID00099859	People around here are a bit upset with you, outsider, but I think there is hope for you yet.
AID00099860	I've seen the bomber! It's... spectacular. The mural is coming true - thanks to you!
AID00099861	Were you interested in hearing the story of our people any time soon, perhaps?
AID00099862	Now that you know the story of our people, you must have all sorts of questions!
AID00099863	How can I help you, Outsider?
AID00099864	Hold it right there! Don't you move!
AID00099865	How the hell did you survive that bombardment?
AID00099866	I still can't believe how you ran through that artillery barrage.
AID00099867	Yes, Outsider?
AID00099868	You're interrupting class, Outsider.
AID00099869	Yeah?
AID00099870	Hungry for grub?
AID00099871	Welcome to Jacobstown, human. You're free to walk around, just don't stare at the Nightkin. They don't like people looking at them.
AID00099872	And if you're NCR, keep it to yourself. They're not popular around here.
AID00099873	Got a problem, could use your help. Been having trouble with NCR mercs harassing the town, and they just showed up again.
AID00099874	I knew you'd make it. Resourceful, as always.
AID00099875	The override module is functioning properly. I'm rerouting power to the Securitron vault at the Fort as we speak...
AID00099876	I just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
AID00099877	When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
AID00099878	Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
AID00099879	I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
AID00099880	Oh, what do you want?
AID00099881	Aha. The brave photographer returns. Good to see you.
AID00099882	Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
AID00099883	I can't talk, not after what happened to Sarah. I feel... so cold.
AID00099884	You shouldn't be here. If people know we talked, they'll suspect you.
AID00099885	And if whoever did this smells a rat, they'll have the Legion after both of us.
AID00099886	That's it, then. How did you know?
AID00099887	If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's working with some dog of the Legion. You've got some explaining to do.
AID00099888	I told you I wouldn't work against the NCR. I meant it.
AID00099889	I'm out of here.
AID00099890	Still helping the Legion. You're gonna get what's coming to you. I promise you that.
AID00099891	We're through working together.
AID00099892	Look, I know the NCR has problems, but I fought with those men. I'll be damned before I betray them.
AID00099893	This stops right now.
AID00099894	We can chat later. The sooner you finish these tests the sooner you can get out of here.
AID00099895	You're the courier I've heard so much about. My squad needs your assistance.
AID00099896	So any word on my friends?
AID00099897	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED LEGION.>
AID00099898	So I finally get to meet the courier who's caused so much trouble for the New California Republic.
AID00099899	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED NCR.>
AID00099900	So I finally get to meet the courier who's accomplished so much in so little time. That is why I summoned you here, right?
AID00099901	I mean, a man nearly kills you, and your response is to track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
AID00099902	The question is... are you ready to get started?
AID00099903	Down the hill, at the west edge of camp, is an old building. It was here when the Fort was taken in 2277.
AID00099904	Inside the building is a hatch, and inside that hatch are two steel doors that bear the sigil of the Lucky 38 casino.
AID00099905	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip Benny was carrying when we captured him. Isn't that interesting?
AID00099906	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip you were carrying. Isn't that interesting?
AID00099907	Even more interesting, there's a slot about the same size as the Chip on the console that opens the hatch. So you know what I think?
AID00099908	I think the Platinum Chip opens those doors - doors that can't be pried open or drilled open or blasted open. Because all that, I tried.
AID00099909	We'll talk again when you've destroyed whatever is down in that bunker - not before.
AID00099910	I felt the ground shake a while ago. I'll take that as a sign you got the job done.
AID00099911	There are rewards for doing as I command. Today, your reward is vengeance. You get to decide how Benny dies.
AID00099912	Go to Benny, let him know what you've decided. My Praetorians will perform the execution - unless you want to perform it yourself.
AID00099913	We have nothing to discuss until you've dealt with Benny.
AID00099914	I'm sure you found Benny's demise pleasing. The destruction of an enemy... there are few things more satisfying.
AID00099915	Let's press on, shall we? As I was telling you before, I want Mr. House out of the picture.
AID00099916	You have an interest in his death, too. If he knows that you destroyed his gadgets beneath the Fort, he will strike back.
AID00099917	You know where to find him. How he dies, I leave up to you.
AID00099918	Until Mr. House has been dealt with, you and I have nothing to talk about.
AID00099919	I've read Mr. House's obituary. Had a high opinion of himself, didn't he?
AID00099920	I spent months feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal, and you've ruined all that.
AID00099921	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at McCarran who could plant that bomb on the monorail? The one you defused?
AID00099922	The garrison I placed at Nelson served a vital strategic function. Did you think you could wipe it out and I wouldn't find out?
AID00099923	Weeks were spent convincing the Great Khans to join the Legion, but you've ruined all that. Haven't you?
AID00099924	With Mr. House out of the way, I can focus on smoothing out a few lingering complications elsewhere in the Mojave.
AID00099925	First up are the Boomers of Nellis Air Force Base, a tribe so reclusive, it lobs artillery shells at anyone who comes near their settlement.
AID00099926	I want you to offer them an alliance with my Legion. My terms are simple: target their guns against the NCR side of the dam when I assault it...
AID00099927	...and they can keep their freedom. If you find they aren't amenable to this offer, destroy them.
AID00099928	It's reached me that you killed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
AID00099929	I understand that you freed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
AID00099930	Silus dishonored himself when he let himself be captured, and he'll pay the price for that. But the NCR didn't learn anything valuable.
AID00099931	Have you brought news of the Boomers?
AID00099932	I would've asked you to forge an alliance with the White Glove Society, but you've already killed its leaders. So instead -
AID00099933	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
AID00099934	I want you to forge an alliance between Caesar's Legion and the White Glove Society.
AID00099935	They used to be cannibals. I expect that information can be used to manipulate them. Go to -
AID00099936	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
AID00099937	Goddammit, go away! Come back when I've had some sleep!
AID00099938	I warned you not to bother me!
AID00099939	Praetorians, kill this asshole!
AID00099940	The last time we met, I believe we were talking about the White Glove Society?
AID00099941	Have you been successful in your efforts to recruit the White Glove Society?
AID00099942	I want you to destroy the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not a full-strength chapter, mind you. The Profligates...
AID00099943	...
AID00099944	Urh...
AID00099945	If you interfere with me getting some sleep again, I'm going to have you killed. We will talk later.
AID00099946	You want to die? Fine!
AID00099947	Praetorians! Kill this asshole!
AID00099948	Has the Brotherhood been destroyed?
AID00099949	I want you to join me in my tent. You and I are going to have a private conversation.
AID00099950	All right, let's state the obvious. There's something wrong with me.
AID00099951	The headaches started a couple months ago. They weren't too bad at first... but now they come frequently and they're... debilitating.
AID00099952	For the past two weeks, my left leg has been dragging. It's stiffer, hard to move. And you've seen me blank out.
AID00099953	Lucius says I stare into space, blink a few times, then keep talking like nothing happened. So what's the diagnosis?
AID00099954	I thank you for saving my life. You're a warrior and a healer - a rare combination.
AID00099955	I thank you for saving my life. Arcade will be a fine addition to my retinue.
AID00099956	I thank you for saving my life. The Auto-Doc module you recovered did the trick.
AID00099957	I trust this payment is adequate compensation for your troubles. Now, lest we grow sentimental here...
AID00099958	The time for battle will soon be upon us. Legatus Lanius draws nigh. When he arrives, my Legion will assault Hoover Dam.
AID00099959	In the meantime, the Profligates have prepared a welcome gift for us. The President of the NCR intends to visit Hoover Dam.
AID00099960	You dispatched President Kimball with real skill. Right under their noses, too - what a humiliation.
AID00099961	Why did you not attack President Kimball?
AID00099962	President Kimball was there on the Dam, right before you. And yet he lives. How did you fuck this up?
AID00099963	My forces are in position to assault the Dam. Legatus Lanius has assumed command.
AID00099964	Are you ready to go to him? To tell him to begin the assault?
AID00099965	You know everything you need to know. Be on your way.
AID00099966	What did you want to know?
AID00099967	What else did you want to know?
AID00099968	Even with the Boomers to deal with, you have questions?
AID00099969	Even with the White Glove Society to deal with, you have questions?
AID00099970	Even with the Brotherhood to deal with, you have questions?
AID00099971	Even with a President to kill, you have questions?
AID00099972	Even on the brink of the final battle, you have questions?
AID00099973	
AID00099974	
AID00099975	
AID00099976	
AID00099977	
AID00099978	Do you have any progress to report?
AID00099979	Allow me to make this clear. Because you've been of service to me, I will forgive your crimes against my Legion this one time.
AID00099980	In the future, if I become aware that you've committed other crimes, I'll have my Praetorians butcher you before my eyes.
AID00099981	If you've committed any other crimes, this is the time to confess them, because after today there will be no forgiveness.
AID00099982	I warned you about this. Praetorians, slaughter this degenerate!
AID00099983	Not now!
AID00099984	Report.
AID00099985	Careful, sometimes they escape and I have to round them up again.
AID00099986	Why do you scare my cattle?
AID00099987	Don't scare the herd.
AID00099988	Leave doggies alone.
AID00099989	You must be very special to Mr. House, huh?
AID00099990	How did you get in there?
AID00099991	Wow... I've never seen anyone go into the Lucky 38 before.
AID00099992	Don't mind me. I was just passing by.
AID00099993	I bet everyone's going to hear about you going into the 38.
AID00099994	My pals said nobody has ever been inside the Lucky 38.
AID00099995	Hey, sexy, come by the Tops later. I'd love to hear your story.
AID00099996	Hi! I'm Sarah, Sarah Weintraub. Welcome to the finest Vault hotel in the whole world!
AID00099997	They're hoarding our water! How are we supposed to survive the desert, huh?
AID00099998	Hope those greedy bastards rot in foul water.
AID00099999	One of these days, we're going to teach them a good lesson.
AID00100000	We'll be back. They can't step over our people forever.
AID00100001	Those hillbillies think they can take our water. We bring civilization, and this is how they repay us.
AID00100002	Damned rats. Next time I see them, I swear, I'll aim right between their eyes.
AID00100003	They've got no right to come near our outposts. This is NCR territory, now.
AID00100004	I almost pity them, these desert savages.
AID00100005	We'll get back our water, and our land, one of these days. We'll be mean to those soldiers until they leave!
AID00100006	They're asking for it, those people from the NCR. We're tough, here! They don't scare us.
AID00100007	This desert is our home!
AID00100008	We've lived here a long time! We're not going to leave our home.
AID00100009	They're mean! Don't want to share water with us.
AID00100010	Hey there. Need anything?
AID00100011	The Caesar has marked you for death... and the Legion obeys. Ready yourself for battle.
AID00100012	Now you will serve as an example to all who dare oppose Caesar's Legion. Defend yourself!
AID00100013	You have defied Caesar for the last time! Your life ends now!
AID00100014	The honcho of one of them Strip families got killed right in his own casino. You know he pissed off the wrong guy!
AID00100015	Now that McNamara's lifted that silly lockdown of his, perhaps people around here will come to appreciate our training simulations.
AID00100016	Perhaps there will be a renewed interest in them as people realize just how close to reality they are... but I digress. What did you want?
AID00100017	Now that Hardin's Elder, I hope I'll be allowed to continue my experiments. I never quite liked the way he looked at me during meetings.
AID00100018	Like he wanted to use me for target practice. The man just has no respect for science! But enough of this. What did you want?
AID00100019	Yes? What is it?
AID00100020	I'll track the virus from over here. You just concentrate on locating the terminals hosting it.
AID00100021	Look, this isn't a great ti- oh, what the hell, it's not like we're making any progress. I'm Ibsen, and I hope your day is going better than mine is.
AID00100022	Did you want to try isolating the virus?
AID00100023	You actually did it! If you don't mind my saying so, I didn't think you had a chance in hell of pulling it off.
AID00100024	But I'm glad to be wrong for once! Thank you, my friend. Please, feel free to access the datastore at your leisure.
AID00100025	I'm only allowed to give you access to non-classified topics, but it's better than nothing, right?
AID00100026	Heard you helped out Jackson, thanks for that. Caravans are still waiting for clearance to move out, but at least there's movement.
AID00100027	Coming from the North? Must be crazy to brave those roads.
AID00100028	Something else you wanted?
AID00100029	Get rough with the escorts, and you'll be seeing the business end of my barrel.
AID00100030	With the Kings gone, who is going to keep Freeside safe?
AID00100031	If the King is working with the NCR, he must have a damn good reason. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite us.
AID00100032	Do I know you?
AID00100033	And you are?
AID00100034	Need something?
AID00100035	I'm hearing good things about you, friend. Good things.
AID00100036	Good to see someone helping out for a change.
AID00100037	People say you've been helping out around town. Much appreciated, friend.
AID00100038	You've done good, kid. Happy to have you around.
AID00100039	I'm amazed by how much you've accomplished here in Freeside.
AID00100040	We've been really fortunate to have you helping Freeside.
AID00100041	Helping on a consistent basis wouldn't hurt you, would it?
AID00100042	You've done a strange mix of things since coming to Freeside.
AID00100043	Does it get painful sitting on the fence like you do?
AID00100044	It seems you've decided to be indecisive when it comes to helping Freesiders.
AID00100045	Throwing caution to the wind yet again, huh?
AID00100046	I guess no one is ever going to change a crazy freak like you.
AID00100047	What did we ever do to you? Can't we all just get along?
AID00100048	Why the hate for Freeside? We're not all bad.
AID00100049	What the hell do you want?
AID00100050	Go to hell you two-faced bastard.
AID00100051	Go away, you rotten bastard.
AID00100052	Way to stab us in the back, asshole.
AID00100053	Howdy, doc. Strange to see you wandering around.
AID00100054	I admire a woman who can hold her liquor. Cute to boot.
AID00100055	She looks like she knows how to handle herself in a fight.
AID00100056	I hope you programmed that thing to be friendly to Freesiders.
AID00100057	Super mutant? You don't look so super to me.
AID00100058	How's it hangin', old man? Oh, sorry.
AID00100059	Hey, Rex. I see your new master is keeping you polished up. Good for you.
AID00100060	Cheer up, lady. You've still got your youth.
AID00100061	I've gotta hand it to you. You've done good things for Novac, but you've also got 'em a little scared of you. And that's great for business.
AID00100062	As long as you keep it coming, I'll get you some things a little cheaper than they should be.
AID00100063	What can I do for you?
AID00100064	Between you and me, I don't think she studied at an accredited institution.
AID00100065	She hasn't paid me anything yet. Should I be worried?
AID00100066	This is NCR Operator - I read you. The supplies are on their way.
AID00100067	Message received - supplies en route.
AID00100068	Supply crate airdrop heading to your location.
AID00100069	NCR Trooper support en route to your location.
AID00100070	NCR support moving to your location.
AID00100071	Request received - NCR Troopers in your area are being redirected to your location.
AID00100072	NCR Ranger support en route to your location.
AID00100073	The cavalry is on its way - just sit tight, we'll be there.
AID00100074	Support inbound - deploying NCR Rangers to your location.
AID00100075	Your wish is my command - NCR support is on its way.
AID00100076	Your problems will soon be solved - Rangers heading your way now.
AID00100077	There is no NCR support in your area - suggest a tactical retreat.
AID00100078	Negative, no NCR support available at your current location.
AID00100079	Transmission not received - attempt new transmission closer to an NCR outpost.
AID00100080	Sorry, sir, that's all the support I can spare today.
AID00100081	I can't redirect any more support to you today - it would put too many lives at risk. I'll get you what I can tomorrow.
AID00100082	I can't afford to send you anything else today. Sorry, sir... good luck out there.
AID00100083	You're just going to have to cowboy up, sir - I can't spare any more support today.
AID00100084	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until at least midnight.
AID00100085	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until we get resupplied tomorrow.
AID00100086	Support request received - deploying Troopers to your area. Hold tight, help is on the way.
AID00100087	Received - find some cover, NCR support is on the way.
AID00100088	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until dawn at least.
AID00100089	Stay safe out there.
AID00100090	Good hunting, sir.
AID00100091	Over.
AID00100092	Over-and-out.
AID00100093	Good luck out there.
AID00100094	NCR Trooper, reporting for duty!
AID00100095	Trooper, ready to fight!
AID00100096	You called for a Trooper?
AID00100097	You called for an extra gun?
AID00100098	I got your call and came running.
AID00100099	Guns and gear - at your service.
AID00100100	Someone said you needed backup? I'm it.
AID00100101	You called for backup?
AID00100102	Where's the fight, sir?
AID00100103	For the Republic!
AID00100104	Ranger at the ready!
AID00100105	NCR Ranger, reporting for duty!
AID00100106	Here we are, you just point and we'll shoot.
AID00100107	Here I am, just point at what needs killing.
AID00100108	One riot, one ranger... let's get this done.
AID00100109	Heard you were in a spot of trouble, friend. Let's fix that.
AID00100110	I heard your call and happened to be in the area.
AID00100111	For the Republic!
AID00100112	You called for an extra gun?
AID00100113	You're lucky I happened to be nearby.
AID00100114	I got your flank - you just shoot what's in front of you!
AID00100115	Ranger here - where's the fight?
AID00100116	What are you doing here? This is our casino, punk.
AID00100117	Gotta run! No time to chat!
AID00100118	Sorry, you just win too much. We can't let you play here anymore.
AID00100119	Welcome to Vikki and Vance, we're still getting the casino up and running but feel free to sit down and play.
AID00100120	We're hoping that Primm will get back on its feet from the money we earn here.
AID00100121	We feel much safer opening the casino back up, now that we have a sheriff.
AID00100122	I'm glad that I could start working here again, things were rough with those convicts in town.
AID00100123	
AID00100124	Thank you for coming, let's talk about that robot.
AID00100125	Have you given any more thought to my offer?
AID00100126	I'd like to talk to you about your robot. Bring it here and we can talk. I'm sure we can be of mutual benefit to each other.
AID00100127	I must say, fortune seems to be with you of late. Please, enjoy this, compliments of the White Glove Society.
AID00100128	You certainly seem to be making a splash with all your success in the casino. Our executive chef prepared this delicacy for you himself. Enjoy.
AID00100129	You are quite simply the talk of the casino right now with your astonishing play. Do stay in our Bon Vivant suite so you may continue to dazzle us.
AID00100130	This simply will not do. You must leave immediately.
AID00100131	The torching is Philippe's idea. Brilliant, no?
AID00100132	Keep away from me, if you know what's good for you.
AID00100133	You look positively famished. We simply can't have that.
AID00100134	Welcome to Top Shelf. The drinks cost twice as much during happy hour, but they draw twice the attention, too.
AID00100135	What can I get you?
AID00100136	What's this about the White Glove Society?
AID00100137	You got me my boy back. I got no words.
AID00100138	Now... I hope you didn't do no harm to whoever's responsible for this. I wanna skin their hides myself.
AID00100139	You got a lot of nerve sticking around here. If I didn't have better things to do I'd thump your skull for what you said.
AID00100140	Tell me good news.
AID00100141	Ted, where are you, boy?
AID00100142	Beg your pardon, stranger, but I'm looking for someone. You ain't seen a young man with dark brown hair and a white hat on lately, have you?
AID00100143	You ain't heard anything about my boy, have you?
AID00100144	You done right by me. I appreciate it.
AID00100145	Oh- oh my. How unfortunate! And in front of all these people, too.
AID00100146	He always was a bit of a pill, Mortimer. He was so pouty when I decided to ban eating people. And now this.
AID00100147	I should've paid more attention to the warning signs.
AID00100148	Can you imagine what people would've said? Why, it would've been a complete scandal if it weren't for you.
AID00100149	To think, Mr. Gunderson, a cold-blooded murderer. It's simply chilling.
AID00100150	But his arrest ought to instill faith in our patrons that murderers are not welcome to gamble here.
AID00100151	What a disaster! An important person dead in my hotel.
AID00100152	Now people will confuse us with Gomorrah. The idea!
AID00100153	So glad you could be here tonight. I had hoped you would join us.
AID00100154	Welcome to the Ultra-Luxe. I do hope it exceeds your every expectation.
AID00100155	You double-crossing snake! I have nothing to say to someone so lowly and ill-mannered.
AID00100156	I wanted Mr. Gunderson out of the way, not slaughtered in my hotel! Our business is concluded. Good day!
AID00100157	You've done enough!
AID00100158	Mark my words. I'll have you filleted for this.
AID00100159	Ah, you're back. You're always a welcome guest here.
AID00100160	Any word as to our arrangement?
AID00100161	What the- ? Who is this trespasser?
AID00100162	How may I be of service, sir?
AID00100163	How may I be of service, madam?
AID00100164	Who are you?
AID00100165	You'll have to excuse me. There's somewhere I need to be right now.
AID00100166	Good day.
AID00100167	Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough?
AID00100168	Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
AID00100169	Can't you see I'm busy?
AID00100170	I thought I told you to get lost.
AID00100171	Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
AID00100172	How may I assist?
AID00100173	Come on, move it.
AID00100174	My daddy's gonna kill all you bastards once he finds out what you done to me.
AID00100175	You know, if you knew what you were doing I coulda been out of there hours ago.
AID00100176	Beg your pardon, but could I trouble you to turn over your weapons?
AID00100177	You! What do you think you're doing?
AID00100178	The sooner you find yourself elsewhere, the better.
AID00100179	Outrageous what Mortimer did. The nerve of some people.
AID00100180	Oh, Mortimer. You always had the gift of gaffe.
AID00100181	Usually we punish people who come in here uninvited. But you've made such a splash, we don't have the heart.
AID00100182	Your theatrics were just priceless. I salute you.
AID00100183	Mortimer's vision was absolutely inspired.
AID00100184	Now it can truly be said that not only to we dress better than anyone, we eat better as well.
AID00100185	I supported Mortimer from the beginning.
AID00100186	Of course cannibalism is civilized! It's all a matter of perspective.
AID00100187	I am at your service.
AID00100188	Have you been inside our bathhouse? The salts in the water work to balance the bodily humors.
AID00100189	To eat at the Gourmand is to spoil the palate. I can't bring myself to eat anywhere else.
AID00100190	Did you see Heck Gunderson the brahmin baron at the bar? He may be a wastelander, but his taste clearly befits his status.
AID00100191	Certainly you can buy the same drinks more cheaply elsewhere, but the point of drinking at Top Shelf isn't the liquor. It's the prestige.
AID00100192	Marjorie has done a remarkable job managing the restoration of this place, wouldn't you agree?
AID00100193	Our executive chef Philippe is the toast of New Vegas. His Brahmin Wellington is absolutely sublime.
AID00100194	You watch yourself around Mr. Gunderson.
AID00100195	Keep your distance. Who are you, and what do you want?
AID00100196	It smells so good in here. Like the air is cleaner than it is outside.
AID00100197	I heard they brought in sea salts from California just for this bath.
AID00100198	I'm so relaxed. Too bad I can't stay longer. But who can, at these prices?
AID00100199	Have you been in the steam room yet? It's just off to the side there. You can feel your aches just melt away.
AID00100200	Every evening most of the White Glove Society sneaks away somewhere. It's probably just for show.
AID00100201	I'm in Heaven. I haven't had a meal like this in... well... ever, really.
AID00100202	Philippe has outdone himself again.
AID00100203	For the price of this meal I could buy a whole Brahmin. But I'd never make that trade.
AID00100204	Hey, any idea how somebody gets into the White Glove Society? Have to know somebody?
AID00100205	They must've spent a fortune renovating this place.
AID00100206	I love the masks. It's like being at a fancy ball.
AID00100207	I'm not really gambling. I'm just hoping to be seen here. People will think I'm rich.
AID00100208	I've heard you have to make reservations at the Gourmand years in advance.
AID00100209	Those masks make me nervous. Is there something wrong with their faces?
AID00100210	There are a lot of rumors going around about the White Glove Society. I heard they used to be tribals.
AID00100211	Top Shelf is the premiere bar on the Strip. The drinks are overpriced, but that's the whole point.
AID00100212	Sorry, friend, you crossed the NCR one too many times - you've been marked for death... and we're here to take care of that.
AID00100213	Nothing personal - orders - you know how it is. Well, let's get to it.
AID00100214	Never mind - don't care. You've got two more days to deal with your bad NCR reputation.
AID00100215	Make them happy or we'll make you dead.
AID00100216	We're back - you've got two days left to improve your NCR reputation. After that we find you and end you. Clear?
AID00100217	Remember us? You've got two days left make up for pissing off the NCR. See you around. <laughs>
AID00100218	So, last day on earth, huh? Getting your affairs in order? Or are you still trying to work on that bad reputation of yours?
AID00100219	The NCR just wants to be friends, but you don't seem to want to play nice. See you tomorrow.
AID00100220	Tick-tock, time's up. The NCR says you gotta die, so guess what?
AID00100221	I gave you three days - you should have crawled in a hole somewhere. Time to die.
AID00100222	Well, take a good look around - this is where your life ended.
AID00100223	It would be so very delightful if you set me free.
AID00100224	If it's bad news, you can take it up with the Colonel. If it's good news, it better involve some dead Fiends.
AID00100225	Just give us an excuse. Been too long since I fired my weapon.
AID00100226	Don't go fucking about, asshole.
AID00100227	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
AID00100228	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
AID00100229	Not much happens here at the Dorado, and that's how we like it.
AID00100230	Only combat I seen lately was shooting some Geckos.
AID00100231	All the juice from Hoover flows right through the Dorado, and we send it west to keep the home lights burning.
AID00100232	My folks back home got lights at night thanks to what we're doing here.
AID00100233	We keep an eye out for Legion raiding parties. They'd love to shut down the Dorado.
AID00100234	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
AID00100235	The power transmission cables are all underground. Good thing, or the old war might've knocked them down.
AID00100236	You visiting every NCR post just to see the sights? This here's the Dorado - it's where we send power back home.
AID00100237	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
AID00100238	If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
AID00100239	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
AID00100240	Been to the top of the dino yet?
AID00100241	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
AID00100242	If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
AID00100243	Can't believe Boone shot Manny.
AID00100244	Boone must've had a hell of a grudge against Jeannie-May.
AID00100245	What did Boone have against Alice?
AID00100246	Boone thought Dusty sold Carla into slavery?
AID00100247	No-bark was harmless. There's no way he had something to do with Boone's wife.
AID00100248	Hell of thing for Boone to kill Ranger Andy like that.
AID00100249	Looks like the McBrides weren't telling tall tales after all.
AID00100250	The McBrides think some mysterious creature is shooting up their Brahmin. Gotta be somebody in town doing it.
AID00100251	All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
AID00100252	Knew those ghouls were up to no good. Look where it got us.
AID00100253	Thanks for all your help.
AID00100254	You been real kind to us.
AID00100255	Just showed up out of nowhere and lended a hand. We appreciate it.
AID00100256	Without you we'd be in a lot worse shape.
AID00100257	I hope good things come your way.
AID00100258	We must've done something right for you to come along like you did.
AID00100259	Stay away, you hear?
AID00100260	You monster!
AID00100261	You're sick, you know that?
AID00100262	I don't much like you.
AID00100263	Maybe you should just move on.
AID00100264	You mind your business, we'll mind ours.
AID00100265	You're confusing to us. Why are you here?
AID00100266	You're kind of odd, aren't you?
AID00100267	How about you just do nice things for us. We liked those.
AID00100268	This is not a market, sir - you need to improve your reputation with the NCR before you're welcome in our outposts.
AID00100269	You're walking on thin ice with the NCR. It's time to decide where your loyalties lay, friend. Until then don't expect any hospitality from us.
AID00100270	The NCR isn't in the habit of letting loose cannons like you just wander our bases.
AID00100271	I suggest you move along until you decide where your loyalties fall.
AID00100272	Get up! You can't sleep here - move on.
AID00100273	Wake up, merc! These cots are for NCR only.
AID00100274	No room at the inn, merc. Move along.
AID00100275	Slumber party's over, pal. Get a move-on.
AID00100276	Wake-y wake-y - eggs and bake-y. <laughs>
AID00100277	Wake up! This ain't your bed.
AID00100278	Get up.
AID00100279	Move along.
AID00100280	Get up. Sleep it off somewhere else.
AID00100281	Get out of that bed.
AID00100282	No sleeping here.
AID00100283	Kill me!
AID00100284	Stay away!
AID00100285	Well, seems like you've redeemed yourself. Welcome back to the NCR's good graces. Play nice... or I'll be back for you.
AID00100286	The brass has put me back on my leash - that must mean that you've decided to play nice with the NCR. Good choice, you just saved your life.
AID00100287	Don't make me come after you again.
AID00100288	I see you took my advice and made nice with the NCR. Guess that means you aren't as dumb as you look.
AID00100289	Stay smart and I won't have to come for you again.
AID00100290	I don't know how you managed to improve your reputation with the NCR after pissing us off like that, but honestly...
AID00100291	I'm just happy I don't have to kill you now. See you around, wastelander.
AID00100292	Get him! Nobody screws with the NCR!
AID00100293	The NCR's come for you - time to die!
AID00100294	You crossed the NCR one time too many - now you die!
AID00100295	Did you think you'd get away with crossing the NCR?!
AID00100296	The NCR wants you dead, friend!
AID00100297	Consider this your final warning from the NCR!
AID00100298	Nobody crosses the NCR!
AID00100299	You'll pay for crossing the NCR!
AID00100300	This is what the NCR does with traitors!
AID00100301	We've got people to kill. Keep an eye out.
AID00100302	Never thought I'd ever have my own town, but thanks to you, now I do. If you wanna make some caps, head on over to the Correctional Facility.
AID00100303	Just tell them I sent you and you should get in without a problem. Keep a close eye on some of those bastards, though.
AID00100304	Oh, not all Powder Gangers out there are friends of mine - like the group in Primm. They'll be gunning for you no matter what, so keep that in mind.
AID00100305	My gang's here, but we'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
AID00100306	We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
AID00100307	I also thought it might be a good thing to jimmy the lock on the Bighorner pen. The noise from the fight will spook them, get them running wild.
AID00100308	Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
AID00100309	We ready to move or what?
AID00100310	What do you want?
AID00100311	What do you want now?
AID00100312	How's it going?
AID00100313	Are you trying to get my saloon shot up? Finish what you started!
AID00100314	Keep an eye out. This isn't finished yet.
AID00100315	Well, you've been causing quite a stir. Glad I finally got to meet you. Welcome to the Prospector Saloon.
AID00100316	So, you're planning on taking on Joe Cobb's gang. It's a big risk, but I suppose you have to do what you think is right.
AID00100317	I hope you didn't just bring a heap of trouble down on Goodsprings by killing Joe Cobb like that.
AID00100318	His friends might come looking for him, and I don't think they're going to care who was involved in his death or not.
AID00100319	Well, what's done is done. So, uh, what can I do for you?
AID00100320	I'm glad that business is over. I like it when Goodsprings is nice and quiet.
AID00100321	Feeling thirsty? I can take care of that.
AID00100322	You shouldn't have crossed the Powder Gangers! Now you're going to pay!
AID00100323	I have a present for you from the Powder Gangers... I hope you like dynamite!
AID00100324	You'll pay for what you did to the Powder Gangers!
AID00100325	Nobody screws with the Powder Gangers and lives!
AID00100326	Here he is, boys! Let's show him what happens when you cross the Powder Gangers!
AID00100327	Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
AID00100328	Keep an eye out for more of them.
AID00100329	This town don't look like much.
AID00100330	Beats being in prison.
AID00100331	I got dibs on the old doc's house.
AID00100332	Need more women around here.
AID00100333	Never liked Bighorners.
AID00100334	Those townies put up a bigger fight than I expected.
AID00100335	That was a hell of a gunfight.
AID00100336	Nothing left to do but kick back and booze it up.
AID00100337	You think any townies are hiding?
AID00100338	I knew we were going to win all along.
AID00100339	Welcome back. Can I get you anything?
AID00100340	Hey there. If you want to buy something from my shop, you'll have to wait till it opens.
AID00100341	Cant' do business now! There's a gunfight!
AID00100342	You must be the one Doc Mitchell was patching up. The way I heard it, I didn't think you'd be walking out of that office.
AID00100343	I've got plenty of supplies for sale. Even got some weapon mods and special ammo - well worth the caps, if you ask me.
AID00100344	If you're hurting for caps, I've also got boxes of surplus ammo in the miscellaneous section. They're not great, but you get what you pay for.
AID00100345	That was a hell of a fight. Let's hope it doesn't bite us in the ass later on.
AID00100346	I won't make any trouble for the gang. Just let me keep my store and I'll cut you a little discount.
AID00100347	You looking to buy some supplies?
AID00100348	I heard about what's been going on in town. Our deal's off. I can't trust someone like you to watch my back.
AID00100349	Keep an eye out. I still think there's a few out there.
AID00100350	That's close enough. Who are you, and what do you want with me?
AID00100351	I owe you a huge favor for this. Here - these are technically Crimson Caravan funds, but I know they'll understand once I explain things.
AID00100352	Thanks again for all your help.
AID00100353	What's the plan? Are we ready?
AID00100354	So, what's going on? Did Sunny agree to help us?
AID00100355	What is it?
AID00100356	That ought to keep things settled for awhile. Hope it stays that way.
AID00100357	Howdy. What can Easy Pete do for you?
AID00100358	Howdy.
AID00100359	We can talk after this is over!
AID00100360	Those bastards got Ringo in the end, after all. At least he went down fighting.
AID00100361	That'll teach the Powder Gangs to avoid Goodsprings in the future.
AID00100362	Time to look alive. The Powder Gangers are here to play.
AID00100363	I'll keep an eye out for the Powder Gangers and meet up with you and Ringo when the time comes.
AID00100364	I don't think Joe Cobb knew what hit him. I'm hoping you took him down for a good reason and not... for fun.
AID00100365	Cheyenne, stay. Don't worry, she won't bite unless I tell her to.
AID00100366	Hi there. Sticking around Goodsprings for awhile longer?
AID00100367	I expect you'll be wanting to go outside after being cooped up for so long, but if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.
AID00100368	Welcome back. I had hoped you wouldn't need to come see me again so soon. What can I do for you?
AID00100369	How're you holding up?
AID00100370	Howdy, pardner! Might I say, you're looking fit as a fiddle.
AID00100371	Howdy, pardner! So, when do the rustlers show up?
AID00100372	Howdy, pardner!
AID00100373	Holy moly! If you hadn't come here like you done, I'd be a goner for sure.
AID00100374	I came up here to draw water, but here, you should have what I got. You look thirsty.
AID00100375	Thank you!
AID00100376	Help me!
AID00100377	Hello. I'm Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
AID00100378	Caravan, citizen, pilgrim, or...?
AID00100379	Been doing a lot of good work out there, setting an example for the others - I know Ranger Jackson appreciates it.
AID00100380	Back again, I see. Something you need?
AID00100381	Got some nerve, coming to an NCR outpost with that look about you. Hope you aren't here to trade, not sure you can afford the prices.
AID00100382	New face in the Outpost, must've come from the North. So - what'll you have?
AID00100383	Back round? Just my luck... what'll it be this time?
AID00100384	Something else you needed? I'm short-handed here.
AID00100385	Any luck up by the track?
AID00100386	Welcome to the New Vegas Medical Clinic. I'm a fully qualified physician and can fix whatever is wrong with you for a reasonable fee.
AID00100387	If you've got the caps, I've also got several implants available to enhance your physical attributes.
AID00100388	You come to the wrong place, traveler. Primm's dying. If you got any sense, you'll be moving on.
AID00100389	Quite a town we got here. Sheriff gets murdered, and Deputy Beagle dragged off for ransom to the Bison Steve. That should bring back the tourists.
AID00100390	Rather be left alone to my misery, if you don't mind.
AID00100391	Before the Powder Gangers came to town, Johnson Nash ran the local store and the Mojave Express station.
AID00100392	I ain't got nothing for you to eat. If you're hungry, see Ruby Nash.
AID00100393	Thanks for freeing the deputy. A bit, anyway.
AID00100394	Thanks for freeing Deputy Beagle. He's better than nothing. Maybe.
AID00100395	Now you freed Deputy Beagle, all Primm needs is a law man who can shoot a gun without wetting hisself.
AID00100396	I hear you're going to help find Primm a new sheriff. Mighty kind of you to take an interest.
AID00100397	So you're the one's going to bring the law back to Primm? I'll believe it when I see it.
AID00100398	I hear you aim to bring rule of law back to our town. God knows we need the help.
AID00100399	Thanks for bringing the NCR to town, stranger. Things're finally looking up for Primm.
AID00100400	Thanks to you I got a mess of soldiers watching every move I make, plus I got to pay taxes for the privilege!
AID00100401	Those soldiers you brought down on us is all business, stranger. Better than lawlessness, though. So you've got my thanks.
AID00100402	This new Sheriff Meyers you brought to us is a lawman through and through. Primm's looking up, stranger.
AID00100403	Thanks for convincing Meyers to come sheriff for us. First time I feel safe in a long time.
AID00100404	This Sheriff Meyers you found for us is working out. Knows his business. We owe you a debt.
AID00100405	Man, it is a real uphill fight these days. I'm not sure how we are going to handle all these convicts.
AID00100406	If you got something to say, say it to the Lieutenant.
AID00100407	Careful, things aren't as safe around here as they could be.
AID00100408	You'll probably want to talk to Hayes.
AID00100409	
AID00100410	Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
AID00100411	Careful! There's still more of them.
AID00100412	Don't think this is over yet.
AID00100413	Way too many strangers coming into town these days. No offense.
AID00100414	If you're looking for supplies, Chet over at the general store can help you out.
AID00100415	Why don't you just move on to another town?
AID00100416	Just leave us alone.
AID00100417	We need more people like you around.
AID00100418	Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
AID00100419	Don't really care much for the unpredictable types. Just saying.
AID00100420	That Doc Mitchell sure knows his stuff, doesn't he?
AID00100421	At least the Powder Gangers are letting me live.
AID00100422	I'm glad I didn't try to fight the gang.
AID00100423	Hell of way to repay Doc, if you ask me.
AID00100424	So many good people are dead...
AID00100425	The recent disturbance at the Tops has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize the Tops.
AID00100426	The recent disturbance at Gomorrah has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize Gomorrah.
AID00100427	Be advised, the Lucky 38 is not open to the general public. Trespassers will be shot. Thank you.
AID00100428	Do not be alarmed. We have been upgraded to serve you better. Have a nice day.
AID00100429	Obituaries of the recently deceased Mr. House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the Vegas Strip, are still available. Just ask any Securitron.
AID00100430	Be advised, Mr. House has voluntarily decided to become a citizen of the NCR.
AID00100431	Sovereignty over the Vegas Strip will be transferred to the NCR at a date yet to be determined. Have a nice day.
AID00100432	Be advised, when Mr. House transfers sovereignty over the Vegas Strip to the NCR, he will remain its sole proprietor. Have a nice day.
AID00100433	The unfortunate incident involving the monorail from McCarran Airport is being resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you.
AID00100434	Be sure to offer words of encouragement to NCR men and women in uniform. Vegas appreciates their business.
AID00100435	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball survived an assassination attempt at Hoover Dam.
AID00100436	Just one more reason to celebrate at one of New Vegas's fine casinos! Thank you.
AID00100437	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball was struck down in a cowardly attack at Hoover Dam.
AID00100438	The Strip offers many fine cocktail lounges where grieving persons may drown their sorrows.
AID00100439	Welcome to Vegas, capital of the sixth state of the New California Republic!
AID00100440	True to Caesar.
AID00100441	Welcome to New Vegas, where a new day is dawning!
AID00100442	Welcome to Vegas. Don't make trouble.
AID00100443	Welcome to the Vegas Strip.
AID00100444	Enjoy all the Vegas Strip has to offer.
AID00100445	Enjoy your time on the Vegas Strip.
AID00100446	Always a pleasure.
AID00100447	Good to see you.
AID00100448	Hello, again.
AID00100449	Hey, look who's here!
AID00100450	If it isn't our favorite V.I.P.!
AID00100451	You're always welcome in this town!
AID00100452	Try to control your behavior today.
AID00100453	I'm hoping this is one of your good days.
AID00100454	Vegas doesn't need your trouble.
AID00100455	Who knows what you're going to do next?
AID00100456	I bet you're up to something.
AID00100457	I don't like the look of you. Never have.
AID00100458	Don't think we aren't watching you.
AID00100459	You've got a reputation in this town, and it isn't a good one.
AID00100460	Don't bother to watch yourself. We're watching for you.
AID00100461	Come on, tough guy/gal - give me a reason.
AID00100462	Take your best shot. Then we'll take ours.
AID00100463	You're bad for Vegas. You don't belong here.
AID00100464	Goodbye.
AID00100465	Have a nice day.
AID00100466	Enjoy your time in Vegas.
AID00100467	Be advised, visitors will be held responsible for the behavior of any robots accompanying them.
AID00100468	Be advised, visitors will be held responsible for the behavior of any non-human sapients accompanying them.
AID00100469	I'd remember if I had seen you here before, I'm sure of it... What do you want?
AID00100470	Welcome back, stranger.
AID00100471	Thank you! They were going to kill me!
AID00100472	Don't worry, I'll stay out of trouble from now on. Honest.
AID00100473	Yeah?
AID00100474	No offense, but I need to focus on getting more rest when I'm off duty. I'm not sleeping so good. So now's not a good time.
AID00100475	If you want to talk, catch me when I'm on duty. I'm up in the dinosaur after 9 pm.
AID00100476	Nice of you to show up.
AID00100477	Is it time?
AID00100478	Let's get out of this first.
AID00100479	We take this boat, it's probably the last one we ever take.
AID00100480	I'm ready for that. Are you?
AID00100481	We're near a Legion slave camp now. I've... been here before.
AID00100482	Let's get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I'm taking the shot. You don't like that, you're on your own.
AID00100483	We're getting close to Nelson. Any closer, I'm shooting any legionary I see. Hope that's not a problem.
AID00100484	Huh. We made it through after all. Not sure what to make of that.
AID00100485	Mercy killing is expected of NCR snipers. The Legion likes to torture their prisoners within sight of NCR positions.
AID00100486	We get called on to end it. I've had my share. Some of them, you think, maybe you could've gotten them out.
AID00100487	Maybe it's not the Legion that got them killed. Maybe it's your orders and you following them.
AID00100488	Caesar's dead. Bet he didn't see this coming when he was having his coffee this morning.
AID00100489	Still. It's not gonna stop the Legion. Might not even slow them down.
AID00100490	Pisses me off that Legion slavers can just operate on NCR turf like that.
AID00100491	If we hadn't caught up to them they'd probably have had a clear path to the river. No one to stop them.
AID00100492	There should be patrols. Checkpoints. We got greedy, overstretched. Now our own territory isn't secure.
AID00100493	Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
AID00100494	Might be too big. Even for us.
AID00100495	If you want out I won't blame you. But I'm going to stay. See if I can hold them off.
AID00100496	Hey. I thought some more about what you said. I think maybe you're right. Maybe I should go to Bitter Springs.
AID00100497	I don't know what I'm hoping to find there.
AID00100498	Hey. I want to thank you for bringing me to Bitter Springs. Things seem... clearer now.
AID00100499	We should get to the Hoover Dam. I don't want to miss this.
AID00100500	That guy Benny was a piece of work.
AID00100501	A face-to-face meeting with House, huh? The NCR would kill to be in your shoes.
AID00100502	Sounds like it's gonna be an all-out war with the Legion soon. Maybe I should've re-enlisted after all.
AID00100503	What is it?
AID00100504	I've been sent to take you back to the Lucky 38. Are you ready to go?
AID00100505	Baby, Lady Luck must be smiling at you today! Compliments of the Tops Casino, enjoy this fine meal and please, keep playing those games!
AID00100506	You've been good to us, baby - now let us be good to you. We'd like you to enjoy this private suite as long as you're in town.
AID00100507	Okay, pal, you've had enough. Time for you to leave.
AID00100508	You better get moving kid, there's bad guys to kill.
AID00100509	Kreger's the officer here, not me. The final say on the plan is up to him.
AID00100510	Moreno and I never did get along. Still, he was a fellow soldier from the old days.
AID00100511	The NCR's the best bet for the wasteland. I'm glad we'll be helping them out.
AID00100512	I'm not helping the Legion, no matter how much you talk them up. I will help my friends prepare, but that's it.
AID00100513	Well, it's about about damn time. What took you... oh.
AID00100514	What brings you around this time?
AID00100515	Let's get going, we have a battle to win.
AID00100516	You don't strike me as someone down on their luck. What brings you to Westside?
AID00100517	Glad to see you made it here all right. So, who are we going up against?
AID00100518	Still waiting on that decision...
AID00100519	We saw everything through the security monitor. I had no idea Moreno would ever pull something like that.
AID00100520	By rights, Moreno's Power Armor now belongs to you. Whitman's volunteered to show you how to use it, so talk to her as soon as you can.
AID00100521	Moreno's a stubborn son of a bitch, but he's also tougher than any of us. I'm glad you were able to talk him into staying.
AID00100522	Since Whitman will be staying with the vertibird, she's offered to give her old suit of Power Armor to you.
AID00100523	You'll need special training to use it properly, so talk to her as soon as you get the chance.
AID00100524	We'll be ready, don't worry.
AID00100525	Sticking around for the attractions?
AID00100526	We're all here. Talk to Kreger about what you've got in mind.
AID00100527	If I had any idea Moreno was capable of doing something that, I'd have warned you. I'm sorry it played out like this.
AID00100528	The NCR's got its share of warts, but I'd rather have them around than the Legion.
AID00100529	I'm not sure if helping the Legion is the right idea. But, I'm going along with it.
AID00100530	Keep your head down - could be snipers around.
AID00100531	I assume this is about something important? You're interrupting my research.
AID00100532	The equipment is hooked up and ready. We can start the test as soon as you give me the go ahead.
AID00100533	Again you interrupt me. Why?
AID00100534	Is there something else I can do for you?
AID00100535	What are you talking to me for? Talk to Kreger.
AID00100536	Now is not the time!
AID00100537	Bah. Looks like I forgot to lock the doors again. If you're with the NCR, get out. This place is mine, and I'm not leaving.
AID00100538	Look, trooper, I was living in this house long before your farms got set up. Don't even think about evicting me.
AID00100539	I didn't come all the way out here just so we could save the fucking NCR. I'm out.
AID00100540	I can't believe I'm going to help the NCR.
AID00100541	Since Johnson won't be coming with us, you might as well take his suit of Power Armor. I'll teach you the basics of how to use it.
AID00100542	Yeah?
AID00100543	I'm ready to fly once we've got a plan. Talk to Judah.
AID00100544	Damn it, Orion. Why did you have to go and do something like that?
AID00100545	Orion always did have a temper, but it was pretty low of him to ambush you like that.
AID00100546	I appreciate you keeping Orion in the group. Since I won't be needing my armor - makes the cockpit a bit cramped - you should take it.
AID00100547	It'll take a few hours to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
AID00100548	I'd love to see the look on the NCR's face when I swoop down in my chopper.
AID00100549	I heard the Legion doesn't care for women, but as long as they stay out of my way, I'll get along just fine with them.
AID00100550	Fine weather for flying. It's times like these that make me miss it all.
AID00100551	Your travels been going all right?
AID00100552	I'm occupied at the moment. Come see me when I'm on the balcony.
AID00100553	Back west, you don't see too many of these. Lakes, I mean. Natural or man-made. Any kind, really.
AID00100554	We neglected the dams or pumped all the water out a long time ago. Owens, Isabella, the San Luis. Drained the aquifers of everything they had.
AID00100555	Just a lot of mud and dust now. It's a different feeling, watching the sun come up over the water. Takes some getting used to.
AID00100556	But if you're here long enough, it starts to seem normal. That's what a ranger's life is now. Looking east.
AID00100557	You've come back to see the chief. Nice of you to humor the radio tender. What can I do for you?
AID00100558	Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
AID00100559	You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
AID00100560	You looking to take the test again?
AID00100561	Hello, don't think I've seen your face before. Are you a citizen of the NCR?
AID00100562	Hello again. We spoke briefly before, but remind me, are you a citizen of the NCR?
AID00100563	Hey there. We hope to see you by the train station one of these nights.
AID00100564	Ah, you're back. Did you want to take that test again now?
AID00100565	You look like a person in need of a good meal. You wouldn't happen to be an NCR citizen, would you?
AID00100566	That meal's still available, but only to NCR citizens. You are an NCR citizen, aren't you?
AID00100567	I've held up my end. You tell the King that I'm willing to listen to him.
AID00100568	This isn't really a good time. What did you want?
AID00100569	Welcome. There's food and water here for any citizen of the NCR. Please, have some.
AID00100570	Yes, was there something else you needed?
AID00100571	<Static>
AID00100572	I'll meet you on the observation deck.
AID00100573	What do you want?
AID00100574	You again. What is it?
AID00100575	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time.
AID00100576	Have you finished your security sweep?
AID00100577	Come back in a minute, I'm busy with security matters.
AID00100578	Shouldn't you be keeping an eye out for anything suspicious?
AID00100579	Good job today. We got the President out safe and sound and I couldn't have done it without you. You have my thanks.

AID00100607	Hey, you haven't seen my friend around here, have you? His name is Ben and he's an engineer.
AID00100608	We were supposed to meet up so we can watch the President's speech together, but he hasn't shown up yet.
AID00100609	Leave me alone.
AID00100610	Still no luck finding my friend. He better show up soon.
AID00100611	Do you mind?
AID00100612	We're a bit busy here.
AID00100613	Why don't you mind your own business.
AID00100614	Managing security on short notice is going to be tough. We'll have to keep the crowd small for the speech.
AID00100615	It's unlikely that the Legion will try anything, but we'll be prepared for it anyway.
AID00100616	We'll keep civilian presence to a minimum. That should avoid any unnecessary risks.
AID00100617	What the fuck just happened?
AID00100618	What is going on?
AID00100619	Quiet, I'm trying to listen to the speech.
AID00100620	Shh! I want to hear what is going on.
AID00100621	Leave me alone, I'm trying to pay attention.
AID00100622	I'm so excited about he President visiting. This is going to be great!
AID00100623	I'm looking forward to seeing the President.
AID00100624	I'm just glad to have the day off for this.
AID00100625	I wonder what President Kimball is going to talk about today.
AID00100626	That was a great speech.
AID00100627	That's a nice suit President Kimball had.
AID00100628	I don't have time to talk right now.
AID00100629	We need to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
AID00100630	Nothing is going to happen to the President on my watch.
AID00100631	Move along.
AID00100632	You really saved our asses out there against the Legion. Thanks.
AID00100633	I can't believe that President Kimball was attacked. I'm just relieved that nothing bad happened to him.
AID00100634	I can't believe President Kimball is dead. He was a great leader for the NCR.
AID00100635	So you're the one that has been running errands for Colonel Moore. Do you need something?
AID00100636	Well look who it is! What can I do for you?
AID00100637	Always nice to have a friend of the NCR around. What can I help you with?
AID00100638	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any of your crazy shit.
AID00100639	Something you need?

AID00100645	Back off.
AID00100646	Watch it.
AID00100647	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after you killed Benny, even.
AID00100648	Quite an honor you spurned, my invite. You would be the first person to set foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years.
AID00100649	But... you still wound up here, right where I wanted you. I knew I could rely on Caesar to return the Platinum Chip to you.
AID00100650	If you're injured, I might have healing powder to spare.
AID00100651	A free woman. It's... been awhile since I've seen a woman who wasn't a slave. I forget myself - are you injured?
AID00100652	With Caesar dead, I'm afraid for the women. The Legate is a brutal man, and he enjoys inflicting pain.
AID00100653	I had hoped to become a great doctor like you someday.
AID00100654	You got Melody her bear back. Very kind of you.
AID00100655	Yes?
AID00100656	So you're the visitor I've heard some of the Legionaries talking about. If you're in the mood to trade, just say the word.
AID00100657	I've heard some bad stories about this Legate. I'm not sure I'll be welcome around here once he takes charge.
AID00100658	Never had you pegged as the doctor-type. Guess I know who to come to now when I get sick.
AID00100659	Howdy again.
AID00100660	Caesar awaits. You can speak with me later.
AID00100661	Caesar is dead at your hands. This crime cannot go unpunished.
AID00100662	I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is own your hands.
AID00100663	Your butchery of Caesar will not go unpunished!
AID00100664	Caesar was right to put his trust in you. Your skill in medicine is beyond anything I've ever seen before.
AID00100665	Caesar sleeps but doesn't awaken. I fear it is only a matter of days before death claims him.
AID00100666	You will answer to me until such a time as Caesar is able to resume leadership.
AID00100667	It's a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience with Caesar.
AID00100668	You've proven yourself to be true friend of the Legion. We have a safehouse available to our agents in the Mojave - here's the key.
AID00100669	It's an excellent place to rest and store extra equipment. In addition, one of our veterans, Atticus, visits the house every few days.
AID00100670	While he's there, you can acquire items useful for stealthy operations against our enemies from him.
AID00100671	Yes? Do you have something to report?
AID00100672	Outsiders are a rare sight at the Fort. Step carefully around here and you might just leave alive. I'm Antony, master of the hounds.
AID00100673	Damn it. I thought they had you.
AID00100674	It'll be strange not having Caesar in command, but Legate Lanius is a strong leader.
AID00100675	I'm sure you had to use a lot of healing powder on Caesar. Well done.
AID00100676	The mechanical dog you have with you - where did you get it?
AID00100677	What?
AID00100678	You here to fight in the arena? Then you're talking to the right man.
AID00100679	What do you want from me, woman? I'm in charge of the arena, not the cooking pots.
AID00100680	As expected, it wasn't much of a fight, but what can you expect from slaves?
AID00100681	A good fight. Some NCR troopers can be competent fighters.
AID00100682	Unbelievable. You stood against a Ranger in single combat and survived.
AID00100683	Caesar was a great man, but the Legion will become even greater with Legate Lanius at its head.
AID00100684	You've done the Legion a great service by healing whatever was wrong with Caesar.
AID00100685	A woman actually proved useful for once. Caesar was bold to put his life in your hands.
AID00100686	What do you need from me?
AID00100687	I can't talk to you. It's not allowed.
AID00100688	I don't want to talk to you! I hate you!
AID00100689	Hi!
AID00100690	I'm still not allowed to talk to you.
AID00100691	Caesar awaits you. We can talk afterwards.
AID00100692	I suspect you'll be a valuable asset to the Legion - assuming you're really on our side, of course.
AID00100693	This is a moment I'd hoped would not come for many years. Caesar's death puts the Legate Lanius in command now.
AID00100694	I'm pleased that you were able to cure Caesar's malady. Though the Legate is a fine leader, we yet need the wisdom of Caesar to guide the Legion.
AID00100695	Was there more for us to discuss?
AID00100696	Mercy...
AID00100697	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He appreciates your service, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
AID00100698	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
AID00100699	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
AID00100700	Any crimes you may have perpetrated against the Legion are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy a second time.
AID00100701	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
AID00100702	Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek has fled the Strip, and is likely making haste for Caesar's camp as we speak.
AID00100703	Caesar awaits.
AID00100704	Don't bother me - I'm training to become a full Legionary!
AID00100705	One day I'll be part of the Praetorian Guard, you'll see.
AID00100706	I can't wait until they let me fight.
AID00100707	I'm harsh on the children, but they'll be excellent Legionaries. I'm quite proud of them.
AID00100708	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
AID00100709	Your crimes against the Legion, including the death of the fearless Vulpes Inculta, are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy again.
AID00100710	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
AID00100711	Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek has fled the Strip, and is likely making haste for Caesar's camp as we speak.
AID00100712	Caesar awaits.
AID00100713	Caesar has permitted your weapons to be returned to you while you serve him.
AID00100714	You've carried out Caesar's will, but I must confiscate your equipment again.
AID00100715	Are you ready to proceed into the underground vault?
AID00100716	Caesar has forbidden you to leave until you抳e carried out his will in the great underground vault.
AID00100717	You may go.
AID00100718	None may enter without Caesar's permission.
AID00100719	The Legion is aware of your mercenary ways and has decided to encourage you work for us rather than against us.
AID00100720	I've provided you the location of a drop box. Every few days, we'll place Legion coin inside.
AID00100721	Though you aren't of the Legion, you've aided us more than once. We acquire many items on our raids, some useless to us, some forbidden.
AID00100722	I've provided you the location of a drop box where you can obtain these items. The box will be replenished every few days.
AID00100723	Please be aware that we'll assume any items left in the box will be unwanted and be removed and destroyed.
AID00100724	My message to you has been delivered, and I've got other places to be.
AID00100725	You must enter Caesar's tent alone. Anyone else must remain outside.
AID00100726	Here - these are the supplies I've acquired for you.
AID00100727	I'll be back in a few days with more supplies. See you then.
AID00100728	Under penalty of death, the prisoner is forbidden to speak with you until Caesar has permitted it.
AID00100729	Caesar didn't become sick until he started dealing with you. If this was all some trick to assassinate him, we will have revenge.
AID00100730	Caesar is near death. Have you brought the means to cure him?
AID00100731	Are you the Van Graffs' emissary?

AID00100862	We're all going to be rich soon. You watch.
AID00100863	One wrong move and you're ash, pal.
AID00100864	You want to chat, talk to the owners.
AID00100865	Good job. I need to work out some last minute details with our new clients, but after that we'll head back to the Rush.
AID00100866	No time to talk. We have to finish these bastards off!
AID00100867	Good, you're here. Do you remember that package I had you deliver? Well, the client liked the sample and put in a massive order.
AID00100868	It's possibly the biggest order we've ever supplied. I've had to repeatedly assure my mother that everything will go smoothly.
AID00100869	And that's where I'm hoping you'll come in. We'll be bringing an escort, and I want you on it. What do you say?
AID00100870	Simon's been telling me how it went. Let's do a quick recap.
AID00100871	Welcome back. Did you have news for me, or are you just here for the guns?
AID00100872	Welcome back. I hope you've been working on that task Jean-Baptiste had for you. My brother is not a patient man by any means.
AID00100873	Welcome to the Silver Rush, where only top of the line energy weapons can be found. What can I do for you?
AID00100874	
AID00100875	Well, looks like you came through after all. She's not half bad looking, is she? It's almost a shame...
AID00100876	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, we're shutting you down for good.
AID00100877	That was fun. Did you see the look on that bitch's face? Priceless.
AID00100878	As I live and breathe, Rose of Sharon Cassidy. The late Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Was hoping you were on that caravan I massacred, but...
AID00100879	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, and we're shutting you down for good.
AID00100880	Hey, how's it going? You find that bitch yet or not?
AID00100881	Ah, just the person I was looking for. Your name came up in a discussion we had recently.
AID00100882	My sister is very impressed with you so far, but I'm not. I don't think you have what it takes to work for this family.
AID00100883	Luckily for you, I'm going to give you the chance to prove me wrong. What do you say? Want to make some real money?
AID00100884	What the fuck do you want? I've got no use for fucking cowards.
AID00100885	Glory's the one you want to talk to about working for us. I just handle the details.
AID00100886	Eh? You want something?
AID00100887	Get the fuck away from me. The last man who bothered me "volunteered" to help test our weapons.
AID00100888	Don't hurry me. I'm trying to get your stuff ready.
AID00100889	My favorite employee returns! What can I do for you?
AID00100890	Hi there! Is this where I can pick up a laser gun?
AID00100891	Is that it? Can I go in now?
AID00100892	Howdy! I just done broke the bank over at the Wrangler there and thought I might peruse your fine wares, maybe lighten my purse a little.
AID00100893	Uh, hi. I was, um, in the area and thought I'd stop by to look at your weapons. Can I go in?
AID00100894	Hey, lookin' for something to replace my old revolver. Mind if I head in?
AID00100895	We've already concluded our business. I suggest you return to your employers.
AID00100896	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
AID00100897	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
AID00100898	Those robots on the Strip, Securi-troids or what have you? Well, they been acting different or something.
AID00100899	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
AID00100900	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots. But lately some of them been two-faced.
AID00100901	A customer who been to the Strip told me the faces on the robots there changed from police to soldiers. Now why would that be?
AID00100902	That Mr. House who lorded over the Strip is dead. Good riddance, I say.
AID00100903	Now that Mr. House's gone, might be opportunities on the Strip for an enterprising merchant.
AID00100904	I bet that Mr. House had a buncha booze in his place. Someone oughta get it out of there. He ain't using it!
AID00100905	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
AID00100906	You hear Caesar's dead? Good for trade if the Legion goes away, that's for sure.
AID00100907	I heard Caesar didn't let nobody drink or drug. Probably why he got killed.
AID00100908	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
AID00100909	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
AID00100910	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
AID00100911	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
AID00100912	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
AID00100913	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
AID00100914	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AID00100915	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
AID00100916	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? Didn't know there was anything left there to attack.
AID00100917	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
AID00100918	With fewer of them Fiends sucking up the chems, maybe I can finally score a hit now and then.
AID00100919	With those Fiends on the run, I should head over to Vault 3 and see if I can pull some salvage out of there.
AID00100920	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
AID00100921	Have you seen that tower on the Strip all lit up? You can see it for miles!
AID00100922	The Great Khans up and left Red Rock Canyon. Who's gonna brew fresh chems now?
AID00100923	I hear the Great Khans got massacred again. No survivors this time, though.
AID00100924	They say the Kings got massacred. Who's gonna watch over Freeside now?
AID00100925	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
AID00100926	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
AID00100927	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
AID00100928	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
AID00100929	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.
AID00100930	Primm wimped out and accepted NCR rule. Some people will do anything to feel safe.
AID00100931	Looks like the war's ratcheting up. I hear the NCR's bringing in elite troops.
AID00100932	They say the Legion's bringing in Veterans from out in Arizona. They must be getting ready to attack.
AID00100933	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
AID00100934	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
AID00100935	I hear reports of Legion raiding parties all over the place. They can't all be rumors!
AID00100936	I keep hearing about some courier making a fuss over at the Strip. Must've delivered more than just mail.
AID00100937	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.
AID00100938	Nobody knows who's gonna win, Legion or NCR. Might not make much of a difference around here.
AID00100939	That tower on the Strip's lit up night and day now! What's it mean?
AID00100940	Goddamn that Mr. House for selling Vegas out to the NCR! The whole Mojave will have to join up.
AID00100941	Howdy.
AID00100942	Hey there.
AID00100943	Oh, you here to work? I think I have an extra shovel around here somewhere.
AID00100944	Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now. Talk to Trent, he might be able to help you out.
AID00100945	Greetings! Pardon my enthusiasm. I'm not accustomed to meeting so many new people, but I find you fascinating.
AID00100946	I've tried to learn as much as possible about the surface world since our community left our home.
AID00100947	Hello again, outlander.
AID00100948	Why are the outlanders killing each other? Why do they treat us like machines? I wish we had remained in the safety, and sanity, of our Vault.
AID00100949	Hello, outlander.
AID00100950	It's good making your acquaintance.
AID00100951	Excuse me, I'm... not from around here.
AID00100952	Horowitz is our leader.
AID00100953	You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
AID00100954	I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
AID00100955	I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
AID00100956	We're in your debt. Thank you, outlander.
AID00100957	I wish we were back at our Vault.
AID00100958	The surface world is a cruel place.
AID00100959	Why are you people treating us like this?
AID00100960	We're heading back home. I hope our troops do the same. This land can't be saved.
AID00100961	Trying to grow crops in this heat, with so little water, is bad enough, but now we've got radiation seeping into the farmlands east of New Vegas.
AID00100962	We're done. Let the people of these hell-hole deal with their problems, I say.
AID00100963	I can't wait to get back to NCR lands.
AID00100964	All our work was for nothing.
AID00100965	We should've never come here.
AID00100966	Good riddance, Mojave.
AID00100967	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00100968	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00100969	
AID00100970	Go Red!
AID00100971	Blood! We want more blood!
AID00100972	Kiiiiiiill, kill now!
AID00100973	I'm betting for Blue!
AID00100974	Did you see that?
AID00100975	Until next time.
AID00100976	Great fighting today.
AID00100977	There's always more next day.
AID00100978	That was a good day for The Thorn.
AID00100979	The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
AID00100980	I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
AID00100981	There's nothing else like The Thorn!
AID00100982	One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
AID00100983	I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
AID00100984	More fights, we want more.
AID00100985	I can't wait to see what fights next.
AID00100986	What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
AID00100987	You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
AID00100988	A Follower is always welcome among our people.
AID00100989	Keep the Ranger on a leash around here.
AID00100990	Another Supermutant roaming outer New Vegas, huh?
AID00100991	All humans are welcome here, even Ghouls.
AID00100992	That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
AID00100993	Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
AID00100994	Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
AID00100995	I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
AID00100996	Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
AID00100997	I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
AID00100998	We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
AID00100999	You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
AID00101000	Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
AID00101001	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
AID00101002	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
AID00101003	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
AID00101004	Wonder if we can move into the Sewers under the Strip now that Mr. House is outta business.
AID00101005	If there's war in the end, it won't affect our city.
AID00101006	Rumors of imminent war have made it all the way down here.
AID00101007	Going to stay down here until all the trouble outside blows over.
AID00101008	Looks like the entire region's going straight where we are - knee-deep in shit.
AID00101009	Only one bad thing about the Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
AID00101010	I can't wait to hit The Thorn. I wouldn't mind hitting on Red Lucy either, but she's outta my league.
AID00101011	Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
AID00101012	Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
AID00101013	Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
AID00101014	Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
AID00101015	Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
AID00101016	Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
AID00101017	I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
AID00101018	Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
AID00101019	Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
AID00101020	You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
AID00101021	You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
AID00101022	I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
AID00101023	One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
AID00101024	All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
AID00101025	One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
AID00101026	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
AID00101027	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
AID00101028	Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
AID00101029	We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
AID00101030	Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
AID00101031	I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
AID00101032	New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
AID00101033	NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
AID00101034	NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
AID00101035	Stay underground at night.
AID00101036	Watch out where you exit. Sewers can lead you to Fiend territory.
AID00101037	Keep an eye on your stuff - damn thieves.
AID00101038	Don't go too far, it's all shadows and dangers in the lower levels.
AID00101039	Careful with those Fiends in the western sewers.
AID00101040	I need my fix.
AID00101041	I hurt all over.
AID00101042	Going to eat the next fucking rat I see.
AID00101043	Just got to find me some sweet Jet.
AID00101044	Won't ever make enough to live outside.
AID00101045	Can't go anywhere else.
AID00101046	Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
AID00101047	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
AID00101048	Good to see you respect the Followers.
AID00101049	Make sure the NCR dog behaves, you're in the Mojave now.
AID00101050	Your merchant friend is always welcome among us.
AID00101051	That bot of yours don't look like anything I've seen in the Mojave.
AID00101052	Your friend's not from the desert, is she?
AID00101053	We tolerate Wasteland savages, as long as they respect our rule around here.
AID00101054	Better be careful around these parts. I hear there's Powder Gangers around and dangerous for merchants like me.
AID00101055	Well, well. It's about time one of you guys came along. I figure the NCR would pay a pretty good bounty for a Powder Ganger.
AID00101056	Hadn't heard there were women Powder Gangers, but a bounty's a bounty. The NCR will probably pay up either way.
AID00101057	You won't see me around here again.
AID00101058	What brings you back?
AID00101059	I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
AID00101060	What more do you want?
AID00101061	I haven't seen you before - what brings you to the Great Khans?
AID00101062	It's good to have you here. What can I do for you?
AID00101063	You honor the Great Khans with your presence. What can I do to help you?
AID00101064	You're always... interesting to have around.
AID00101065	What are you doing here?
AID00101066	If you're smart, you'll find somewhere else to be.
AID00101067	You're becoming quite the political agitator. I can't say I'm displeased.
AID00101068	Something else you wanted?
AID00101069	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AID00101070	So, the cub enters the wolf's den. What do you want, cub?
AID00101071	All four of my most trusted advisors have told me we should break our alliance - maybe I should hear you out after all.
AID00101072	I'm beginning to hear troubling rumors from my advisors. Would you know anything about that?
AID00101073	More of my advisors are starting to talk openly of breaking our alliance. I wonder where that idea is coming from?
AID00101074	I understand you dealt the NCR a crushing defeat at Forlorn Hope. I hope that trend continues.
AID00101075	That's why I've made a decision: I'm naming you my heir. When I die, leadership of the Great Khans will pass to you.
AID00101076	You've been doing good things for us - don't think I haven't noticed. What can I do for you?
AID00101077	It's always a pleasure to see you around the camp.
AID00101078	Are you going to help us this time, or vex us?
AID00101079	And so the unpredictable one returns. What do you want from us?
AID00101080	I've got little enough patience for you. Consider your words carefully - you don't want me as an enemy.
AID00101081	In the past, I'd have had someone like you executed for showing their face here - consider yourself lucky I don't have the warriors to spare.
AID00101082	Ah, you're back. What else do you need?
AID00101083	Not now, I'm busy.
AID00101084	You look like someone with a question. What can I do for you?
AID00101085	It's good you told me about Dermot and Saint James. It was killing that needed doing.
AID00101086	You think you see the worst of what people can do to each other, and then there's always something else to top it.
AID00101087	I'm going to assume you had reason to kill Dermot and his pet. Always had a bad feeling about them. But everyone else here is hands-off.
AID00101088	You can just talk to the whores, you know. You and me don't need to talk unless there's trouble.
AID00101089	What do you need this time?
AID00101090	Hey, don't drag me into this!
AID00101091	Hey, mister, looking to relax? Looks like you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders... and upper thighs.
AID00101092	Sorry, ma'am, but my services are "members only," all right? You might try Sweetie.
AID00101093	That situation with Dermot and Saint James must've been stressful. Looking to relax?
AID00101094	Glad you came back. You wanna get together with me?
AID00101095	Still wasting your time in this pit, honey?
AID00101096	Fuck off! I ain't helping you!
AID00101097	I got nothing you need. If it's ass you're looking for, talk to Pretty Sarah.
AID00101098	I said fuck off.
AID00101099	Yeah! Fight! Fight!
AID00101100	Why you talking to me, man? I'm trying to relax here, got it?
AID00101101	When I talk to a girl, I start the conversation! And I didn't start no conversation with you.
AID00101102	We got to go through this again? What's it about this time?
AID00101103	Oh my! Keep me out of this!
AID00101104	Hello, stranger. You looking for a good time?
AID00101105	Don't see many or your kind here in the Casa. Women, I mean - who ain't working.
AID00101106	Always knew there was something wrong with Dermot and Saint James. Neither one ever got busy between my legs!
AID00101107	Been enjoying your time at the Casa?
AID00101108	Look out!
AID00101109	Hey, honey. Looking for something softer than a man can give you?
AID00101110	Hey, baby. What say you and me get acquainted?
AID00101111	Dermot being dead I don't care about, but Saint James was regular income. Maybe you could throw some business my way?
AID00101112	Hi again. You here to play?
AID00101113	You look busy. Talk to me later.
AID00101114	Welcome to the Casa Madrid - cheapest, cleanest whores in all New Vegas. If you want to know the rates for poon, talk to the whores.
AID00101115	Thanks a lot. I'm out Dermot and St. James's rent - and they paid regular - and once they get to stinking I'll have to clean up the mess, too!
AID00101116	Yeah? What is it?
AID00101117	I'm not getting sucked into your fight, friend.
AID00101118	Tom Anderson. Can I help you?
AID00101119	Good to see you again.
AID00101120	Hello? Can you help me?
AID00101121	Have you decided to help me?
AID00101122	Please hurry! She's on the ridge, past the broken radio tower.
AID00101123	Sorry I tricked you, but thanks for clearing out the Geckos. Now I can get to that stash up there... after I deal with you.
AID00101124	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. Looking to exchange?
AID00101125	Welcome to Gomorrah, how can I help you?
AID00101126	Welcome to Vikki and Vance. Can I help you with an exchange?
AID00101127	If you're down on your luck and need some caps, I buy just about anything. Of course, I've also got plenty of things for sale, too.
AID00101128	Here to do business?
AID00101129	Howdy. Name's Bob, but folks around here call me Klamath Bob. What can I do you for?
AID00101130	Hey, stranger. Hope you been well. What do you need?
AID00101131	Nng. Hi.
AID00101132	Nng. Hi again.
AID00101133	Hi there. Welcome to the Westside Co-op. I'm Clayton Ettienne. Let me know if you have any questions.
AID00101134	Welcome back. How can I help you?
AID00101135	Uh... hi.
AID00101136	Oh, hello.
AID00101137	Agh! I wasn't doing anything!
AID00101138	Hello again.
AID00101139	Trying to elevate your status by being seen with me? It won't work.
AID00101140	You look like you'd be more at home at one of the other hotels.
AID00101141	I'm sorry, I prefer to converse with interesting people.
AID00101142	I hear you've been clawing your way up the social ladder. What's your secret?
AID00101143	People are talking about you.
AID00101144	I like the cut of your jib.
AID00101145	Well, if it isn't the toast of New Vegas.
AID00101146	Welcome to the pinnacle of society.
AID00101147	Would you mind staying here a moment? I want people to see that I know you.
AID00101148	You're an odd duck.
AID00101149	You've been acting awfully strange towards us.
AID00101150	What are you playing at? I'm really starting to wonder about you.
AID00101151	I'm having a little get-together later, but you are not invited until you learn to behave.
AID00101152	How can you be such a dear and such a bother at the same time?
AID00101153	You'll never be at the top until you learn some manners and common decency.
AID00101154	What's that smell? Oh, it's you.
AID00101155	Please, you're lowering my status.
AID00101156	Shouldn't you be in Freeside with the other thugs?
AID00101157	You vile cad. I've half a mind to give you a solid thrashing with my cane.
AID00101158	Remove yourself from my sight at once.
AID00101159	Loathsome wretch.
AID00101160	Life at the top is immensely satisfying.
AID00101161	It must be horrible to live in places without luxury.
AID00101162	Being an honorary member isn't the same as being a real member, but it still makes you better than everyone else.
AID00101163	So you've joined the Society. It feels different, doesn't it? Like you're entitled to the best things life has to offer.
AID00101164	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
AID00101165	The Lucky 38's perpetual glow these days... it's rather gauche, don't you think?
AID00101166	If Mr. House is going to lower his standards, we'll just have to raise ours!
AID00101167	Need some grub? I got you covered. Cheap and filling.
AID00101168	Lupa met an honorable death in the arena.
AID00101169	Some of the slaves have been spreading stories about the Burned Man again.
AID00101170	<Renolds Top Level Topics>
AID00101171	We don't have time to talk, let's get this fight going.
AID00101172	Please don't interrupt me right now.
AID00101173	Keene has never liked me. If anyone can talk him into backing down, it'll have to be you.
AID00101174	Don't you see everything is going to hell? I'm gonna go find someplace safe to hide out at.
AID00101175	I love this place, but I can't take this kind of stress anymore. I'm going to head back west to see my grandkids.
AID00101176	Hello there youngster. Welcome to my baby.
AID00101177	Troublemaker, don't you dare hurt my baby.
AID00101178	Always good to see a friendly face, you're always welcome to visit my baby girl.
AID00101179	You keep yourself outta trouble around my baby, I'm watching you.
AID00101180	Welcome back to my baby.
AID00101181	 NCR, no better than common thieves. Where do they get off stealing our armor?
AID00101182	Caesar on the cross, been a long time since I've seen the kind of work you've laid down today... a damn long time.
AID00101183	And the screams of those Legion bastards as they kicked dirt running East... like a choir of angels to my ears.
AID00101184	Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb from God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
AID00101185	Could use a hundred of you, just scatter you over the East like jacks, give those plumed fucks the what-for.
AID00101186	Well, you took your sweet ass time coming here.
AID00101187	Let's get down to brass tacks, we need to get this thing moving if we want to keep the element of surprise.
AID00101188	That was a fine bit of work back there. Truth told, I'm surprised you made it out of there in one piece. You and the Dam.
AID00101189	I'm impressed to say the least, and that's no easy thing. You've secured NCR's future - the administration sends its thanks, for what it's worth.
AID00101190	
AID00101191	Damn Brotherhood, bunch of elitist jerks. What were we to do, leave good armor out in the wastes to rust?
AID00101192	Whatever it is, make it quick. I don't have time for idle chatter.
AID00101193	As if I didn't have enough to worry about, one of our facilities was recently broken into and its power diverted.
AID00101194	Have you seen that damned tower in the Strip, all aglow? Of course you've seen it. Everyone's seen it.
AID00101195	That was our power that did that, and I will find out who did it. Did you have something to report?
AID00101196	
AID00101197	Not right now, I'm busy.
AID00101198	You again. What do you want?
AID00101199	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports about the "savior of the NCR" for a while now, and wanted to meet you myself.
AID00101200	You've proven yourself especially capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
AID00101201	Crocker gets handed the fluff missions that no one else wants to do. When people need something really important done, they come to me.
AID00101202	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
AID00101203	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports of your activities for a little while now, and wanted to meet you myself.
AID00101204	Even though you've caused us a great deal of trouble, you've proven yourself very capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
AID00101205	Crocker gets handed the fluff missions that no one else wants to do. When people need something really important done, they come to me.
AID00101206	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
AID00101207	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports of your activities for a little while now, and wanted to meet you myself.
AID00101208	The reports label you a troublemaker, but also extraordinarily capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
AID00101209	Crocker gets handed the fluff missions that no one else wants to do. When people need something really important done, they come to me.
AID00101210	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?

AID00101214	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
AID00101215	Yes, did you have an update on the Khans?
AID00101216	Have you discovered what the Omertas are up to?
AID00101217	Report. Is Mr. House still a threat?
AID00101218	Has the Brotherhood been found?
AID00101219	Is the president safe?
AID00101220	It's best not to keep the general waiting.
AID00101221	Ah, our hero returns. What can I do for you?
AID00101222	You are the courier Lord Caesar has spoken of. The slaughter begins, then.
AID00101223	Greetings, courier. We caught word the battle was about to begin. We arrived before the road was closed off; our warriors are here to assist you.
AID00101224	Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
AID00101225	We are excecuting your commands.
AID00101226	Go on.
AID00101227	Not now!
AID00101228	You shouldn't be here. It's best if you just move along.
AID00101229	Get out of here already.

AID00101233	And who is this before me in the colors of the Legion. An envoy... dressed as an insult to all that carry out Caesar's will.
AID00101234	And who are you to come before me... you bear the insignia of the Bear, yet you do not wear it as a soldier of the West wears it.
AID00101235	And the West seeks to appease me by sending a woman? Such gifts are meant for the cowards of Vegas, not for the Legion.
AID00101236	An envoy of Vegas, yet you carry yourself for battle. If so, you cannot *truly* be of that city of cowards.
AID00101237	And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the Bear, yet are ready for battle.
AID00101238	Your words have done nothing but delay the inevitable. Now, see what my hounds and my blade will bring to you.
AID00101239	For the Legion.
AID00101240	[FAILED] Enough.
AID00101241	Guess it ain't no secret how you, uh... I say, can you ask them to put their weapons down. Was just reaching in my coat to give you a cigar.
AID00101242	Come on, men - we're pulling out.
AID00101243	Got leveled by a goddamn courier - screw the message, it's the messenger that'll fuck you.
AID00101244	What the hell? No, get away from me, you goddamn TV on wheels!
AID00101245	What is this Brahmin shit. I'm not getting the feeling we're all about to sing koombahyah here.
AID00101246	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand boy.
AID00101247	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand girl.
AID00101248	Should have known, Greeks and gifts. That, and next time, shoot the messenger.

AID00101253	Can I help you with something, stranger?
AID00101254	I hear tell you pretty well wiped out the Fiends around here. Not bad, not bad.
AID00101255	Welcome back, merc.
AID00101256	Have you taken care of those squatters?
AID00101257	Have you run off those greasers?
AID00101258	Good to see you around. Take care, merc.
AID00101259	You're still around, huh?
AID00101260	What do you want?
AID00101261	Piss off!
AID00101262	We're going, we're going!
AID00101263	What are you doing here? Get out before I blow your head off!
AID00101264	I can't believe this shit. You again?
AID00101265	So, what's up?
AID00101266	I hope you've got some good news about Alice.
AID00101267	I should kill you, right here, for what you've done.
AID00101268	Hello there! Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company. How can I help you today?
AID00101269	Need anything?
AID00101270	I owe you an apology, stranger. We almost lost her forever, and I'm glad that things didn't turn out for the worse.
AID00101271	Oh. Hello, there.
AID00101272	I hope you're not planning on visiting  the Strip.
AID00101273	The rest of this city has gone absolutely to seed!
AID00101274	Any news from out of town?
AID00101275	Don't recall seeing you here before.

AID00101296	I've got nothing to say to you, stranger.

AID00101303	She... Alice left, didn't she? I can't believe you let her go! Some help you've been!
AID00101304	Good to see you again. I'm just passing through here; staying at this refugee camp, under the wing of NCR thugs, is the last thing on my mind.
AID00101305	Hey there! I'm on my way to Novac to find a new home, even if it lasts just a little while. See you around.
AID00101306	Hello again. Well, this is my place now. With time, I'll turn it into a good home.
AID00101307	The NCR's all over Primm. Steer clear.
AID00101308	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AID00101309	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
AID00101310	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
AID00101311	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
AID00101312	You and me are all right.
AID00101313	Good to know that you've got my back.
AID00101314	Don't let the NCR catch up to you, all right?
AID00101315	You seem to be on the level.
AID00101316	Heard some things about you. Good things.
AID00101317	Guess we're on the same side.
AID00101318	I respect you, but I want nothing to do with you.
AID00101319	I've heard some crazy stories about you.
AID00101320	Whatever is you want, keep me out of it. I've heard the stories.
AID00101321	I don't think I'll be turning my back to you anytime soon.
AID00101322	Keep your hands where I can see them - makes me feel better.
AID00101323	You make it hard to trust you, you know that?
AID00101324	You better be sleeping with one eye open.
AID00101325	Why are you even talking to me?
AID00101326	I'd kill you right now if I could.
AID00101327	You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
AID00101328	You and I have got nothing to talk about.
AID00101329	Just keep on walking.
AID00101330	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
AID00101331	Didn't know they still had robo-dogs around.
AID00101332	Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
AID00101333	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
AID00101334	Now there's a fine-looking woman. Just needs to ditch the robe.
AID00101335	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
AID00101336	We bought and sold guys like Four-Eyes over there like property back in the prison.
AID00101337	You eyeballing me?
AID00101338	Damn. Running low on smokes again.
AID00101339	Any lawman that comes after me won't have it easy.
AID00101340	Never gets old when something blows up.
AID00101341	No way I'm going back to prison.
AID00101342	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
AID00101343	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
AID00101344	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
AID00101345	You and me are all right.
AID00101346	Good to know that you've got my back.
AID00101347	Don't let the NCR catch up to you, all right?

AID00101364	Damn. Running low on smokes again.
AID00101365	Never gets old when something blows up.
AID00101366	Wouldn't mind having one of those little flying robots myself.
AID00101367	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AID00101368	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AID00101369	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AID00101370	Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
AID00101371	What on earth is *that* creature?
AID00101372	Your lady friend seems out of place here.
AID00101373	Your friend seems too civilized for a place like this.
AID00101374	Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
AID00101375	Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
AID00101376	My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
AID00101377	I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
AID00101378	I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
AID00101379	I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
AID00101380	Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
AID00101381	I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
AID00101382	Kimball's luck ran out.
AID00101383	I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
AID00101384	They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
AID00101385	They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
AID00101386	As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
AID00101387	Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
AID00101388	We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
AID00101389	The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
AID00101390	I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
AID00101391	It's clear that savages, like the Khans, can't be trusted to civilize.
AID00101392	I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
AID00101393	The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
AID00101394	I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
AID00101395	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
AID00101396	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
AID00101397	Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
AID00101398	You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
AID00101399	It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
AID00101400	A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
AID00101401	Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
AID00101402	People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
AID00101403	Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
AID00101404	You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
AID00101405	Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
AID00101406	We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
AID00101407	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
AID00101408	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
AID00101409	What's up.
AID00101410	Uh huh.
AID00101411	Hey.
AID00101412	Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
AID00101413	With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
AID00101414	I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
AID00101415	What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
AID00101416	You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
AID00101417	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
AID00101418	I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
AID00101419	Instead of spending a fortune in this war, the NCR should be paying us to survive!
AID00101420	I could buy back my *life* with the money it must cost to make one of those Ranger elite armors!
AID00101421	The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
AID00101422	Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
AID00101423	Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
AID00101424	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
AID00101425	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
AID00101426	Don't go messing around with the Fiends.
AID00101427	We ain't here to help you, get out.
AID00101428	What the hell are you doing here? Civilians shouldn't be here.
AID00101429	It's not safe around here.
AID00101430	Try not to get killed, okay?
AID00101431	You should go topside.
AID00101432	Ooh, suddenly I feel all tingly. And I find I've got a rocket launcher!
AID00101433	Mr. House is just pleased as punch you got those old Securitrons back on-line, sugar.
AID00101434	Ooh, the lights are all back on! How nice!
AID00101435	You should have seen Mr. House when he heard what you did to the Omertas. He was as giddy as a schoolboy!
AID00101436	Those nasty Brotherhood of Steel brutes are all taken care of? Mr. House will be so glad!
AID00101437	When he heard you stopped President Kimball's assassination, Mr. House went on about martyrs and misadventures for hours!
AID00101438	I bet those Boomers have some awfully big... guns.
AID00101439	See? Mr. House has everything well in hand!
AID00101440	Well hello, sugar. Mr. House is waiting for you in his office.
AID00101441	How do they keep the floor in here so clean?
AID00101442	They should have used Paladins to help protect the President.
AID00101443	If the NCR wasn't too proud to accept our assistance their president would still be alive.
AID00101444	The NCR is lucky we've chosen to side with them or we'd take the death of their President as a moment of weakness.
AID00101445	We are here to help protect the dam, word is Oliver is on his way and the battle will start soon.
AID00101446	We're ready to deploy whenever the NCR says the word.
AID00101447	The Brotherhood hasn't seen a real battle in so long, I have no doubt we'll handle this no problem.
AID00101448	The NCR is going to be grateful to have us around when the shooting starts.
AID00101449	The Elder sent us to help protect the dam and await further orders.
AID00101450	Mike Lawson sure knows his way around the dam.
AID00101451	I'm honored to work with Lawson, he knows more about the dam than anyone.
AID00101452	Fantastic grabbed my ass. That guy is vile.
AID00101453	I'm pretty sick of Fantastic, can't that guy keep his hands to himself?
AID00101454	Everyone is abuzz about Oliver arriving soon. That must mean the battle is close.
AID00101455	Hanlon is pretty legendary, people talk about what he did at the first battle of hoover dam with awe and respect.
AID00101456	I miss California.
AID00101457	By Mars these weaklings die easily.
AID00101458	Don't get in my way!
AID00101459	What happened to your buddy's face?
AID00101460	I am not an alcoholic, sir. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
AID00101461	I am not an alcoholic, ma'am. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
AID00101462	The problem with some people is when they're not drunk, they're sober.
AID00101463	People ask me how much it takes me to get drunk. I don't know. I usually can't remember numbers, let alone where I am the next morning.
AID00101464	Hey! Watch your back! There be a pack of ol' ladies runnin' round here somewhere! Don't let them catch you unawares!
AID00101465	I don't want to get shot!
AID00101466	It's about time a new customer showed up around here. Was getting sick of dealing with the same faces all the time.
AID00101467	I can't believe the NCR actually showed up. We sure showed them, though. Right?
AID00101468	What's up?
AID00101469	There's still more troopers out there!
AID00101470	I know all the guys I did time with around here and you ain't one of them. Can't fool me with that Powder Ganger getup.
AID00101471	Okay, I know I wasn't serving time with no girl, or I'd have heard about it. You come to play with the Powder Gangers?
AID00101472	Look at you, walking in here like you're one of us. Don't you know this is Powder Ganger territory?
AID00101473	Hey there, girlie. You here to party with the Powder Gangers?
AID00101474	Did you see me take out that NCR trooper? Right through his eye!
AID00101475	What do you want now?
AID00101476	I knew I should've gone with Cooke!
AID00101477	Heard there was a new face around. I'm the doctor around here... sort of.
AID00101478	That... was close. I really need to find some nice, quiet place to settle.
AID00101479	Sticking around, I see.
AID00101480	Have you gotten my pardon from the NCR yet?
AID00101481	Thanks for getting me that pardon. Me and the boys will take good care of Primm, don't you worry.
AID00101482	I can do right by this town, they were in need of some frontier justice.
AID00101483	Sounds like the NCR is finally getting off their ass to settle things around here. Don't expect me to get in their way.
AID00101484	Maybe you ought to worry about the guys trying to kill you first.
AID00101485	Didn't know anyone would willingly walk into this place, not unless they were looking for trouble. What's your story?
AID00101486	Need to talk about something?
AID00101487	What are you looking at?
AID00101488	Will you quit bothering me?
AID00101489	No time to talk. We've got trouble.
AID00101490	Not half bad in a fight, are you? I figure you had a lot to do with me still breathing after all that.
AID00101491	I don't have any more work for you, but feel free to stick around as long as you want. You never know when the NCR will be back.
AID00101492	Dawes said he let somebody in. So, you going to give me a reason not to kill you and throw your body back outside?
AID00101493	You're the one Cobb mentioned. Maybe you feel like helping us out around here.
AID00101494	Not bad in a fight, are you? I really thought the NCR had us in their sights that time.
AID00101495	I've been thinking that since you've been good to us, we can be good to you.
AID00101496	We've got plenty of spare powder and dynamite around. Say the word and we can give you some of it every couple of days.
AID00101497	I don't know what to make of you, you know that? I know I can't really trust you, that's for sure.
AID00101498	Still, you've helped us out some, so maybe I ought to repay you some. I've spread the word about you to a bunch of guys out in the wasteland.
AID00101499	As long as you're not an enemy, they'll cut you some slack when you're near their camps. Trespass too long and they'll come after you.
AID00101500	What?
AID00101501	Shut up and fight!
AID00101502	I'm Sergeant Lee. Lieutenant Hayes radioed ahead to say you were on the way.
AID00101503	We've got surprise on our side, and that's about it. Once we blow a gap in the fence, we've got to pour on the fire and keep them disorganized.
AID00101504	Our goal's to take out their leader, some assbag named Eddie. With the ringleader gone, the rest will fold.
AID00101505	That's all the briefing you're going to get. Let's go.
AID00101506	We can take it from here. We might have some cleaning up to do, but Eddie's a deadie. Gangs with no leadership don't last long.
AID00101507	I'll radio Hayes to let him know the prison's ours. But you should swing by to see him the next time you're near Primm.
AID00101508	Thanks for the help.
AID00101509	You just walked into the wrong camp, my friend. Hand over everything you've got and we might let you live.
AID00101510	I got the message. You won't see me around these parts again.
AID00101511	Hey, I've been sent to tell you that, while you're not exactly a friend, we know you've helped us out some all the same.
AID00101512	We figure some kind of truce is in order. As long as you don't come too close to any of our camps, we'll let you pass without trying to kill you.
AID00101513	Of course, the truce is off once we know you're an enemy.
AID00101514	Got nothing else to say to you.
AID00101515	<groan>
AID00101516	<grunt>
AID00101517	Fuck Benny. We'll make him pay for stabbing us in the back.
AID00101518	There's more of them still out there.
AID00101519	Beats going up against the Legion.
AID00101520	Never gone up against Great Khans before.
AID00101521	Man, this place is a mess.
AID00101522	This rubble is slippery. Watch your step.
AID00101523	We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
AID00101524	It's about time they called us back.
AID00101525	Work's slow right now, but at least it's something.
AID00101526	Train's not working yet.
AID00101527	I'm happy the Big Horn is still around.
AID00101528	Some of the machinery's frozen up. Need someone to talk a look at it.
AID00101529	All right, Smoothskin, I'm letting you in. You better watch yourself. I'll sure as hell be watching you.
AID00101530	What's the problem, smoothskin? Lost your way?
AID00101531	Hello? Who's down there?
AID00101532	Stop messing around with the intercom, smoothskin.
AID00101533	God, but are you ugly! Get upstairs and talk to Jason before I throw up just from looking at you.
AID00101534	Go bother Jason, smoothskin. I don't like having you around.
AID00101535	Have you found the components we discussed?
AID00101536	Have you found the components we discussed?
AID00101537	Hi, REPCONN Quest Stuff, have at it!
AID00101538	A customer! Not many people come into Boulder City these days.
AID00101539	This isn't a public relations office. If you're not here about a bounty, you can go pester the Colonel.
AID00101540	I see you're still alive, and that's promising. Any luck on that bounty?
AID00101541	Got any more good news for me?
AID00101542	Still working on that last bounty?
AID00101543	Perimeter's been quiet since you left. The Fiends are running scared. I doubt they'll give us any more trouble, not for a long while.
AID00101544	I haven't got any more bounties for you. It's been quiet and calm since you last reported in. Just how I like it.
AID00101545	If you're looking for bounties, you're too late. Had a few Fiends on my shitlist, but they either got killed or moved on.
AID00101546	I hear you killed Driver Nephi. My team would've liked to get a shot at him... but we're still glad he's dead.
AID00101547	I'm Lieutenant Gorobets, First Recon. If you're looking to collect a bounty, you should talk to Major Dhatri.
AID00101548	You came through for us. I have to admit... I wasn't sure you'd make it.
AID00101549	Means a lot, letting my team get payback. Here. We all pitched in some caps for you. Even Sterling, and he's famous for his tight wallet.
AID00101550	We'll get ourselves into position. See you at the rock crushing plant.
AID00101551	We're all set up. You just lure Nephi close.
AID00101552	It's always hard to lose someone under your command. I hate writing the letter to their folks.
AID00101553	What can I do for you?
AID00101554	Hey, my man! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
AID00101555	Hey there, miss! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
AID00101556	Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
AID00101557	S-s-sucks about the LT. N-n-nobody can replace him.
AID00101558	How 'bout you get out of my f-f-face? I'm First Recon. I don't need to t-take shit from civvies.
AID00101559	K-killing some Fiendsi? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
AID00101560	One shot, one kill. That's how Ten of Spades p-p-plays the game.
AID00101561	Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
AID00101562	Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!
AID00101563	B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
AID00101564	You remember me, right? T-t-ten of Spades. First Recon.
AID00101565	Girl... you are some grade-A poon, anybody ever tell you that?
AID00101566	You keep talking to me, sweetness, and people are gonna think we're an item. Not that I mind.
AID00101567	Never seen you around before. What do you want?
AID00101568	Cut the chatter. Focus on the job, or you're gonna end up dead.
AID00101569	Quit talking! We've got a job to do.
AID00101570	You did good out there. Glad you let me get a piece of Nephi.
AID00101571	What a pointless trip. Here I thought I'd get a shot at that junkie bastard.
AID00101572	Damn that 10 of Spades. Just had to go and get himself killed.
AID00101573	Gorobets was all right - for a man. Not gonna be the same without him.
AID00101574	I've been seeing Usanagi, and things are better. I'm not so angry all the time, you know? And, uh, I'm not trying to jump every woman in camp.
AID00101575	Well, not all the time, anyway,
AID00101576	Hey.
AID00101577	Hey, girl. You need something from me?
AID00101578	Yeah?
AID00101579	
AID00101580	Howdy. Name's Sterling, First Recon. Can't say I've seen you before. I'd remember, if I had.
AID00101581	Took some skill to bring down that Fiend. You done good.
AID00101582	Nothing like a job done right. Wish I had a cigar.
AID00101583	Been a while since they let us out of the fence. Brass must really want Nephi dead.
AID00101584	Best you don't worry about us. We'll watch your back.
AID00101585	It's always hard when your commander goes down, but we'll pull through all right.
AID00101586	Howdy. What brings you back?
AID00101587	I'm Bitter-Root. First Recon. You got a reason to talk to me?
AID00101588	Can't talk now. Got to keep my eyes sharp.
AID00101589	Eyes sharp, now.
AID00101590	Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
AID00101591	That's one less drugged-out waster. Best part of this job - shooting folks who deserve it.
AID00101592	I've never lost a CO before. It doesn't feel right.
AID00101593	Didn't think you'd be back. What's this about?
AID00101594	Let me guess. You got work for me, right?
AID00101595	Well, you're too late - I just quit the bounty trade. Soon as I pick up some caps that Dhatri owes me, I'm out of this scrapyard.
AID00101596	Heard you got Cook-Cook. I hope you roasted that bastard with his own flamer.
AID00101597	Yep, I'm still here. Shit, I got nothing better to do, right?
AID00101598	Welcome to REPCONN Headquarters, Rocketeer! Come all this way to see our little facility, have you?
AID00101599	I'm here to answer any and all questions you may have - within specified parameters - and if you'd like, I can provide a tour of our museum.
AID00101600	Welcome back! Interested in a tour of the REPCONN museum? Or did you have a question about the company I could answer?
AID00101601	Yes? Did you have a question?
AID00101602	Keeping the Strip secure has been hell since the monorail was taken out.
AID00101603	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
AID00101604	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
AID00101605	How could we lose Kimball at a time like this?
AID00101606	Chief Hanlon was a model soldier. We all looked up to him.
AID00101607	Too bad about Chief Hanlon. He did what he thought was best for us.
AID00101608	Without Camp Forlorn Hope, it's a matter of time before the Legion surrounds us at the Dam.
AID00101609	This whole war's gonna change when the Ranger veterans get here. Soon as we see the Black Armor, we can all breathe easier.
AID00101610	A platoon of veteran Rangers is like a tactical nuke, only tougher to scare.
AID00101611	This battle... everything's riding on it.
AID00101612	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
AID00101613	The security lapse with the monorail is a huge embarrassment.
AID00101614	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
AID00101615	There's something fishy about how Chief Hanlon died. It just doesn't add up.
AID00101616	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
AID00101617	No hope of securing the border now that Forlorn Hope fell.
AID00101618	The Ranger veterans have been running ops in Baja. We'll be a different army with them here.
AID00101619	We've got our best Rangers here now. All of a sudden I like our chances a whole lot better.
AID00101620	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
AID00101621	With House dead, we'll have Vegas annexed before the year's out.
AID00101622	It's been a long tour. All I can think about now is going back home.
AID00101623	Well! You're here ahead of schedule! I suppose it's just as well...
AID00101624	This is where I wanted you to end up, after all. I knew I could rely on Caesar to give you back the Platinum Chip.
AID00101625	I see that you reached your destination safely. Shall we get to work?
AID00101626	Have you come to your senses? It's not too late to upload the Platinum Chip's data to the primary computer.
AID00101627	Stop wasting time. Go upload the data on the Platinum Chip to the facility's primary computer.
AID00101628	As you know, the Platinum Chip upgrades my Securitrons' operating software. Well... there's an army of them here.
AID00101629	The Securitrons policing the Strip are a fraction of the total number manufactured. The rest, I stored here.
AID00101630	The Platinum Chip is a data-storage device.
AID00101631	I need you to manually upload the data from the Chip to the facility's primary computer. There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
AID00101632	There's a complication. While I can broadcast to this screen, I can't control any of the facility's systems.
AID00101633	That means I can't deactivate its security bots... most of which appear to be active, according to the status board I'm looking at.
AID00101634	Do you have the slightest idea of what you've done, of what you've destroyed?
AID00101635	You've doomed Vegas to be ruled by corrupt bureaucrats or fanatical savages.
AID00101636	Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.
AID00101637	Your work here is done. Return to the Lucky 38 so we can discuss next steps.
AID00101638	You have a very bright future ahead of you. Thanks to your actions today, so does the rest of mankind.
AID00101639	Benny is dead, and yet you don't appear to be carrying the Platinum Chip.
AID00101640	I don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
AID00101641	Before we go any further - where is the Platinum Chip?
AID00101642	So, we meet in person finally... so to speak. You did well at the Fort - kudos.
AID00101643	Have you come to your senses - or will there be a repeat of the last incident?
AID00101644	You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver an package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
AID00101645	I will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted... negative outcomes. But - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
AID00101646	Well enough. Let's have the Chip, then.
AID00101647	This meeting has been a long time coming, hasn't it? You've come a long ways, literally and, I suspect, figuratively as well.
AID00101648	I have to ask - now that you've reached your destination, what do you make of what you see?
AID00101649	The point of my inviting you to visit me here at the Lucky 38 before stomping into the Tops on your own was to help you prepare - tactically.
AID00101650	Now, because of your carelessness, Benny has fled the Strip, taking with him the Platinum Chip.
AID00101651	Well... this meeting has been a long time in coming... longer still, since you took time to charge into the Tops before coming to see me.
AID00101652	Before we get down to details, I must ask - now that you've arrived at your destination, what do you make of what you see?
AID00101653	Can I look forward to a more substantial conversation this time?
AID00101654	Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's else little for us to discuss until you have.
AID00101655	What is the purpose of this delay?
AID00101656	Events have transpired in a... less-than-optimal fashion. Benny has fled the Strip, and the Platinum Chip has not been recovered.
AID00101657	Benny must be pursued, and the Platinum Chip, recovered.
AID00101658	So... Benny has been handled and you've recovered the Platinum Chip. Let's have it.
AID00101659	I take it you've come to deliver the Platinum Chip?
AID00101660	Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... capacious. So very dear.
AID00101661	Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.
AID00101662	That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day.
AID00101663	But the bombs fell first. Suffice it to say, the delivery was never made.
AID00101664	Come now, come now... get thee to the elevator.
AID00101665	To the elevator, if you please... Stop dragging your feet.
AID00101666	Trips to the basement are rarely so educational, don't you think?
AID00101667	I've since broadcast the upgrade to every Securitron in range of my transmitters, and I must say, it's causing quite a stir down on the Strip!
AID00101668	Make your way to Caesar's Camp at Fortification Hill. Something very interesting awaits you...
AID00101669	To secure the future of New Vegas, I must have your assistance. The work ahead is dangerous, but you weather danger well.
AID00101670	Have you found the courage to do what's necessary?
AID00101671	What did you wish to know?
AID00101672	What else did you want to know?
AID00101673	We'll talk again once you've concluded your work in the bunker at Fortification Hill.
AID00101674	The foundation is laid. My Securitrons on the Strip are upgraded, and those at the Fort, ready for action.
AID00101675	Now it's just a matter of adjusting the attitudes of some lesser groups while we wait for Caesar's Legion to attack Hoover Dam.
AID00101676	The next step is to add the Boomers' considerable firepower to my growing arsenal... or at the very least, ensure their neutrality.
AID00101677	As I was saying, I need you to enlist or neutralize the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base.
AID00101678	Any progress with the Boomers?
AID00101679	Your next assignment won't take you far. It concerns the Omertas and their den of vice, Gomorrah.
AID00101680	As the decisive encounter between the bull and the bear looms close, my concerns about the Omertas have grown.
AID00101681	I've never expected loyalty, mind you. A reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always run true.
AID00101682	But that's just it - lately the Omertas' cooperative silence has been deafening. Not a single complaint? They're up to something.
AID00101683	Your next assignment would've been to investigate the Omertas, but you managed to foil their scheme before I could put you to the task.
AID00101684	I should compensate you as though it were an official assignment, however. Wouldn't want to disincentivize your proactivity.
AID00101685	I'd hoped to have you investigate the Omertas, but after the trouble you caused at Gomorrah, they won't let you in the front door.
AID00101686	I'll see if I can make some progress with informants. You're useless in this matter.
AID00101687	As I said before, I need you to investigate the Omertas, to see what they're up to.
AID00101688	What do you have to report about the Omertas?
AID00101689	Your next assignment is to locate and destroy remnants of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00101690	The NCR nearly did the job at Helios One a few years ago, but there seem to have been survivors, unfortunately.
AID00101691	Given the Brotherhood's fanatical views on technology, they can be counted on to oppose my regime.
AID00101692	Please - put them out of my misery.
AID00101693	As I've said, I need you to locate and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00101694	Have you destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel?
AID00101695	Will you ensure that President Kimball survives his visit to Hoover Dam?
AID00101696	Aaron Kimball, the president of the New California Republic, is going to visit Hoover Dam to "boost morale."
AID00101697	Apparently he hasn't considered the effect on the troops' morale of seeing their beloved leader get his brains blown out by a Legion sniper.
AID00101698	I need you to make sure that no harm comes to President Kimball. It's fortunate that you've maintained good relations with the NCR...
AID00101699	Unfortunately, I can't use you to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
AID00101700	Odds are that Caesar will launch his assault on the dam after Kimball's visit is concluded, one way or the other - so be on guard.
AID00101701	Unfortunately, I can't very well send you off to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
AID00101702	This can be used to our advantage, though it'll a grim business. Go to Hoover Dam and attack the gathering crowd, and his visit will be canceled.
AID00101703	Your reputation with the NCR isn't exactly stellar, so I'll have to vouche for you. It'll make a scene, but it's worth it.
AID00101704	Last I knew, President Kimball wasn't scheduled to visit the Lucky 38. Be on your way to Hoover Dam, will you?
AID00101705	If not for you, President Kimball would be dead. So you needn't feel guilty when the NCR's rout from Hoover Dam demolishes his political career.
AID00101706	Why in the world did you attack President Kimball?
AID00101707	Kimball is dead - what a mess you've made!
AID00101708	Between the Strip and HELIOS One lies the El Dorado electrical substation.
AID00101709	Humble as it appears, the substation has immense strategic value, for it's there that you'll jumpstart the Lucky 38's dormant reactor.
AID00101710	Gain access to the substation's control room and install this override module. Just so you know, there are NCR troops guarding the station.
AID00101711	Until the Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted, we have nothing to discuss.
AID00101712	As you can see, Vegas is humming along. I've tested my c3i broadcasting arrays. Everything is in order.
AID00101713	And just in time, as it turns out. The forces of Caesar's Legion are on the march, establishing a staging area east of the dam.
AID00101714	Their assault could begin at any moment. So that's where you'll be heading, if you're ready - Hoover Dam.
AID00101715	The Legion's assault could begin at any moment.
AID00101716	What did you want to discuss?
AID00101717	What else did you want to discuss?
AID00101718	There will be no repeat of the trouble we had last time, I trust?
AID00101719	I'm optimistic that this conversation will go more smoothly.
AID00101720	I'd rather you just dealt with the Boomers, but all right...
AID00101721	I suppose the Omertas can wait a few minutes.
AID00101722	A few questions, and then you'll handle the Brotherhood, I hope?
AID00101723	Questions like "Will President Kimball survive his visit to Hoover Dam?"
AID00101724	Even now? On the brink of battle?
AID00101725	I knew you'd make it. Resourceful, as always.
AID00101726	The override module is functioning properly. I'm rerouting power to the Securitron vault at the Fort as we speak...
AID00101727	I just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
AID00101728	When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
AID00101729	Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
AID00101730	I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
AID00101731	Why have you... done this?... centuries of preparation... so much good, undone...
AID00101732	I have... nothing... to say... to you...
AID00101733	Hey again.
AID00101734	It sure is nice to see everybody working together like family. Maybe now the baby Jesus won't cry his self to sleep every night.
AID00101735	Shooting guns is real scary, but I think I got the hang of it now!
AID00101736	Razz said the candy he got us was special! I wonder what he- Gnaaah, kill, kill, rip and kill! -meant by that?
AID00101737	Poindexter says all our troubles is over now, and we won't have to go to war. I guess that's good, but I don't understand why.
AID00101738	Is it true? The big boss ranger done killed his self?
AID00101739	Howdy, great to see you!
AID00101740	Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta wright my mama and tell her I met you!
AID00101741	Uh, howdy. Are you gonna be mean or nice this time?
AID00101742	You scare and confuse me, and I think you should be nicer to people.
AID00101743	Go away, you big bully!
AID00101744	Ahhh! Somebody call in the Rangers!
AID00101745	Howdy.
AID00101746	While I have already internalized the new skills we have discussed, I feel as though my solution was nevertheless more practical.
AID00101747	Excellent! Maximal reward for minimal work.
AID00101748	I trust you're satisfied with the squad's newfound teamwork? It's almost entirely my own doing, I assure you.
AID00101749	Ever since consuming those "illicit rations" Razz offered us, I have felt a steadily-increasing desire to kill.
AID00101750	I understand the esteemed Chief Hanlon is no longer with us. A shame. He seemed to be the only competent leadership this Army had.
AID00101751	I'm assuming you aren't associated with the Army or the Rangers. What can I do for you?
AID00101752	You've done an excelent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
AID00101753	You've managed to become extraordinarily well-liked by the top brass. You should exploit that for your own gain wherever possible.
AID00101754	Your behavior has become an unwelcome X-factor, and I would kindly ask you to consider altering it.
AID00101755	I'm afraid I have no desire to socialize with unstable elements such as yourself.
AID00101756	I must question your logic in coming here, in light of your prior actions.
AID00101757	Kindly remove yourself, as I have no desire to be struck by a stray round when disgruntled troopers begin firing on you.
AID00101758	Greetings once again.
AID00101759	Okay, okay, I admit it - knowing how to use these guns right is pretty cool.
AID00101760	Sweet, those "readiness reports" are so good they actually gave me a raise!
AID00101761	I thought all that touchy-feely teamwork bullshit was kind of fruity... but it kinda feels good knowing my squad's got my back.
AID00101762	Ha ha, fuck me, Jack's shit is still the best!
AID00101763	Heard Chief Hanlon took the lead expressway to Angel-town. Weird shit, yo.
AID00101764	What you want, homes?
AID00101765	Aw, shit, here comes the brown-noser. What you want?
AID00101766	Shit, look who it is, the crazy one! What up?
AID00101767	Every time you come around, the brass gets their pants in a bunch. Keep on coming by.
AID00101768	Shit, you just piss folks off wherever you go, huh?
AID00101769	I know I talk a lot of shit about the army, but you come around here again and I'll slit you.
AID00101770	Yo.
AID00101771	Something I can do you for?
AID00101772	I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
AID00101773	I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
AID00101774	Hey, friend. Need something?
AID00101775	Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
AID00101776	I think you'd better get out of here.
AID00101777	There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.
AID00101778	I don't speak with outsiders, smoothskins especially. Talk to our leader, Jason Bright.
AID00101779	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer himself! Welcome back.
AID00101780	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer herself! Welcome back.
AID00101781	That was something else. I look forward to the next ride - once I recover, you monster.
AID00101782	What are you doing here!? I don't want to be near you ever again! Leave, leave... just leave, ok!?
AID00101783	Hey, stranger! Where have you been, uh? I missed you!
AID00101784	Give me a few to close the shop, I'll meet you at the room.
AID00101785	Mickey is... he's no longer... alive. I'm sorry, but I just can't go on.
AID00101786	Hey buddy, spare a cap? I can make it worth your while.
AID00101787	This man's prices are steep, but I hear he's worth it.
AID00101788	Thanks, mister!
AID00101789	Thanks, lady!
AID00101790	I wish he'd quit running.
AID00101791	He's kinda cute, isn't he?
AID00101792	We're gonna have rat tonight!
AID00101793	Hey pal, spare a cap?
AID00101794	Ah, my favorite customer. Got a cap for me?
AID00101795	You could do worse than leave your life in my hands, wanderer. Far worse.
AID00101796	A hundred caps sees you safely through Freeside. What do you say?
AID00101797	You're in luck stranger. You just happen to be talking to the most successful bodyguard in all of Freeside.
AID00101798	And I just happen to be available at the moment. One hundred caps gets you a peaceful, pleasant trip through our fair district. Guaranteed.
AID00101799	Hello, my friend! Can I perhaps interest you in some protection? My services come cheap at only a hundred caps.
AID00101800	Look, I'm being paid to shoot people who talk to you, not talk to you myself. Just pretend I'm not here or something.
AID00101801	Freeside truly is an interesting place, isn't it?
AID00101802	I am sorry, my friend, but I must concentrate on watching out for threats. Please do not take offense.
AID00101803	Something you need, kid?
AID00101804	Heh, so the Garrets sent you to track me down? What a joke.
AID00101805	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
AID00101806	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler.
AID00101807	Hey man, can you spare a few caps?
AID00101808	How are you today? Santiago is fabulous!
AID00101809	Ah... I wasn't expecting you to return.
AID00101810	Santiago has nothing left to give. Leave me now.
AID00101811	Santiago thanks you for getting him this job.
AID00101812	Hello. Lovely to meet you.
AID00101813	I have nothing more to give. Leave me be.
AID00101814	Are you here to drop off medical supplies? Leave them with the rest in the middle of the courtyard.
AID00101815	Looking for a fix, man? I got what you need.
AID00101816	You seen Dixon around? He said he'd be back today.
AID00101817	Come on, man. I'm dying here.
AID00101818	Do you have chems, buddy? I could really use a fix.
AID00101819	So you're back. Got any chems for me yet?
AID00101820	Howdy.
AID00101821	Not bad. You're lucky I was drawing their fire, otherwise you would have been chewed up.
AID00101822	I sent one of my guys back to the King to report what happened. You should head back. He'll probably want to thank you.
AID00101823	The King just sent a messenger over, saying these guys are off-limits. He's probably already heard about what you did here.
AID00101824	Looks like you get to be a hero. Enjoy it while it lasts.
AID00101825	Why the hell are you here? I got this under control!
AID00101826	Why are you talking to me? Smoke these guys already!
AID00101827	Good, you're here. These soldier boys don't kid around. They must have had a lookout posted and spotted us coming.
AID00101828	They took out two of my guys right away, and now the rest are too scared to move in. That leaves you.
AID00101829	What do we have here? Another petitioner for the King?
AID00101830	Look who's back. If you want to see the King, you better pay up.
AID00101831	Go on. The King's a busy man. Be grateful for this opportunity.
AID00101832	I've got my eye on you. You cross the Kings, you'll regret it.
AID00101833	Look, Rexie, someone new's come to see us. Poor boy. He hasn't been feeling well lately. I'm the King. What can I do for you?
AID00101834	That's strange, I don't see ol' Rexie with you. He usually comes back here whenever he's not with you. Where'd he get to?
AID00101835	Why Rexie, you look all better, boy! Good as new! Did my Rexie get a new brain?
AID00101836	I sure appreciate you coming back. You think a little more about my offer?
AID00101837	I... I can't believe Pace is gone... He was always right here, you know? Always cracking me up with some story or another.
AID00101838	Anyway, what did you want?
AID00101839	I heard someone got to my friends who were injured. Looks like we'll never find out who did it now.
AID00101840	Did you want something? I'm all kinda shook up right now.
AID00101841	My eyes on the street tell me you haven't paid our mutual friend Orris a visit yet. Until you do, we got nothing to talk about.
AID00101842	What do you have for me?
AID00101843	
AID00101844	Have you found anything out? Or were you just here to chat?
AID00101845	You find out somethin' about them soldier boys yet?
AID00101846	I've already heard all about what happened, and all I can say is that I, and all of Freeside, thank you. Thank you very much.
AID00101847	I heard all about what happened. Maybe it's time for a little more talkin' and a little less fightin'.
AID00101848	Things have been lots better since you helped with with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So what can I do for you?
AID00101849	What can the King do for you?
AID00101850	Leave me alone. Can't you see a man's fighting for his life here?
AID00101851	What is it? Can't you see I want to be left alone with my friend here?
AID00101852	Tell the King we thank him for looking out for us.
AID00101853	I ain't got any reason to talk to you. Scram.
AID00101854	That true? Did the King really send you?
AID00101855	Hope what I remembered helps.
AID00101856	Hey, you helped out Bill Ronte so the Followers worked out a deal for you to drink free.
AID00101857	The King controls the water pump. If you want water, you need to pay like everyone else.
AID00101858	Guess we won't be doing this for much longer.
AID00101859	The Major gave us all a talking-to. Guess she heard about some of the guys' "night missions."
AID00101860	I've never seen the Major so angry before. She may look calm right now, but don't let her fool you.
AID00101861	Hold up. What's the password?
AID00101862	Let's try to keep the line moving, folks.
AID00101863	Try to take only what you need.
AID00101864	Submit to a credit check or present your passport before proceeding to the gate. Trespassers will be shot.
AID00101865	Don't bother me right now. I've got to get back to see if any customers are waiting.
AID00101866	Stay away from me, if you know what's good for you.
AID00101867	Come on, let's get this over with.
AID00101868	Don't distract me. I need to focus all my senses on keeping you safe.
AID00101869	This gentleman and I were just settling on a price. I'm afraid you'll have to hire one of the others this time around.
AID00101870	If you need to cross Freeside, no one will keep you safer than I will.
AID00101871	I knew you'd be back. Ready to hire the best?
AID00101872	Fully Integrated Security Technetronic Officer active and reporting for duty.
AID00101873	Operation complete. Thank you for your business.
AID00101874	Greetings. Fisto is programmed to please.
AID00101875	I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position.
AID00101876	Welcome to Mick & Ralph's. If you need guns, I'm your man.
AID00101877	For general supplies and other services, see my partner Ralph.
AID00101878	You might want to clean up your act. Some of the locals have been complaining.
AID00101879	Ralph and I don't sell to people who treat our friends badly.
AID00101880	I don't take kindly to deadbeats who treat my friends like trash. Get out of here.
AID00101881	I wish I'd never gotten involved with the Omertas. All of this bloodshed...
AID00101882	One of these days, those bastards will get what's coming to them. In the meantime, I'll be sure to be more careful with my sales.
AID00101883	Anyway, is there anything I can get you?
AID00101884	That was a real mess the Omertas were looking to create. Glad you could get all that sorted.
AID00101885	May have cost me some business, but at least we avoided a shitstorm.
AID00101886	Anything I can get you?
AID00101887	All of the scumbags are coming out of the woodwork now that the Kings are keeping everyone in line.
AID00101888	At least gun sales are better than ever. Now what can I get you?
AID00101889	I'm not sure how to feel about the Kings and NCR sorting out their differences, but as long as business keeps up, I'm a happy man.
AID00101890	Now what can I get you?
AID00101891	People say Mr. House hasn't been heard from in a while. Good riddance.
AID00101892	Now what can I do for you?
AID00101893	I heard about some things you've done around town. Nice to know someone is helping out for a change.
AID00101894	Welcome back, buddy! What can I get you?
AID00101895	Welcome back.
AID00101896	I don't deal with dirtbags. Take a walk.
AID00101897	If you're looking for guns, talk to Mick. Otherwise, I've got a nice selection of general supplies and other services.
AID00101898	Hey, thanks for getting Bill Ronte fixed up. I was really getting sick of paying for water.
AID00101899	Now, what can I do for you?
AID00101900	Man, Jacob's Absinthe is phenomenal stuff. I don't think I've slept this well in ages...
AID00101901	If you haven't tried it yet, he's been supplying the Wrangler with the stuff. So, what can I get you?
AID00101902	With the Kings gone, it may be a little hairier around here, but business is good.
AID00101903	Anything in particular you're looking for?
AID00101904	So, Ambassador Fancypants has graced us with his presence! I apologize if you're looking for Pre-War pipes and smoking jackets, I'm clean out.
AID00101905	Playing debt collector for the Garrets, eh? I guess someone has to do their dirty work.
AID00101906	Pimping ain't easy, eh? Maybe if you find some decent talent, I'll start visiting the Wrangler more often.
AID00101907	How's it going, friend? Looking for anything special?
AID00101908	And NCR wins? No, really, I'm shocked.
AID00101909	I totally didn't expect the guys with advanced armor and seemingly unlimited ammunition to take down an army of machete-wielding ingrates.
AID00101910	With Caesar's Legion in control of the dam, I think things are going to get much more difficult around here.
AID00101911	That old coot, House, is going to make me rich! With all the new rules and regulations in New Vegas, I'll make a killing circumventing them!
AID00101912	An independent Vegas... Never thought I'd see it.
AID00101913	House may be gone, but the players remain the same. Business as usual, then.
AID00101914	Hey, what can I get you?
AID00101915	Heh heh heh heh heh. <Coughs>
AID00101916	Wha-?
AID00101917	Bang bang bang bang bang!
AID00101918	Reach for the sky, lady.
AID00101919	Reach for the sky, mister.
AID00101920	I wish I had a gun.
AID00101921	Max can't even hit me. He's so dumb.
AID00101922	I'm bored.
AID00101923	Hey pal, you dig my new hat? I've been making some good money lately, and figured I'd treat myself.
AID00101924	Hey, I thought about what you said before, and picked up this sweet piece. You were right, I feel much safer.
AID00101925	Hey, I'm sorry about being so dismissive about your suggestion before. I thought a lot about what you said.
AID00101926	There've been times when just a little bit of money from a stranger would have made a huge difference to me, so I get where you're coming from.
AID00101927	Maybe I could make that kind of difference for someone else... ah, who am I kidding?
AID00101928	Hey, I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier, about saving up and leaving this dump. Do you really think it's possible?
AID00101929	Look pal, I've been thinking. I know we got off to a bad start there, but let's put it behind us, okay?
AID00101930	Hey pal, I made so much recently that I was able to afford this little number too. How do I look?
AID00101931	You again. You want a tip, or you here to piss me off some more?
AID00101932	Hey pal, you got the caps, I got the info. You do have the caps, right?
AID00101933	Ah, my favorite customer returns. Want a tip?
AID00101934	Well, look who it is. I was just thinking about you.
AID00101935	I recently came across a piece of info that you just have to hear, and since you're my best customer, it's on the house. Interested?
AID00101936	Hey, I've still got that super-hot tip for you, and it's still free. What do you say?
AID00101937	Hey pal, I've finally saved up enough caps to leave this dump, so no tips today. Or ever, I guess, ha ha.
AID00101938	A lot of these caps came from you, so I wanted to say thanks before I shove off. Meeting you really changed my life.
AID00101939	Okay, pal, we're going to do this quick and easy. I know you're loaded down with caps, judging by how much you've already given me.
AID00101940	So I thought I'd save us both some time and just take all the caps you have. Hand them over.
AID00101941	Oh hey, didn't think I'd see you here. I decided to stop scrounging for caps and start making a difference.
AID00101942	The Followers have been really great. There's always something that needs to be done, and everyone here treats me really well.
AID00101943	Sorry if you stopped by my old spot looking for info. I've been so busy lately that I haven't heard anything.
AID00101944	Anyway, feel free to stay as long as you like. I've got to get back to work.
AID00101945	What do you want?
AID00101946	
AID00101947	Welcome to Freeside. Try not to get killed.
AID00101948	Kick back and relax! Everything is allowed in Freeside!
AID00101949	The only rule in Freeside is don't mess with the Kings.
AID00101950	Watch yourself around here.
AID00101951	If you're heading to the Strip, just go through the gate there.
AID00101952	Freeside is the Kings' turf. Remember that.
AID00101953	Great, another one come in from the wastes. Like this place isn't crowded enough.
AID00101954	Move along.
AID00101955	Good evening! Are you looking for companionship, love?
AID00101956	You look new to Freeside, so here's a little advice, friend. Don't go past the south gate greeter without talking to it first.
AID00101957	Hello again.
AID00101958	Ah, you return to me a King yourself! It would be an honor for me to do your hair! That is why you are here, yes?
AID00101959	Ah, I knew you'd be back. Ready for your entire life to change?
AID00101960	You want your hair done, too? No, no, no. The Kings are many, and their hair must be *perfect*.
AID00101961	When is the King coming back up here? I'm bored!
AID00101962	The King is all that his name implies, and then some.
AID00101963	The King promised to take us out tonight. I simply adore going to the Tops!
AID00101964	All I do all day is read magazines. You'd be amazed what you can learn from them!
AID00101965	I want to go to the Strip! We never get to go to Gomorrah anymore!
AID00101966	You're not a King! Does the King know you're up here?
AID00101967	You want to travel through Freeside with ease, you hire a King. We're everywhere, and no one messes with us.
AID00101968	Your safety is practically guaranteed, for just 100 caps.
AID00101969	Hey there, you want to cruise Freeside in style, you'd do worse than hire a King to tag along.  Only 100 caps.
AID00101970	You wanted something?
AID00101971	Something on your mind?
AID00101972	Well, I hate to support the damn NCR, but it looks like they're the only thing between us and mass slavery at the hands of the Legion.
AID00101973	Here's to the slaughter of every last one of those brahmin-poking meatheads, Caesar's Legion.
AID00101974	Doesn't look good, this build-up of forces between the NCR and Legion. Not good at all for business in the long run, if the Legion wins.
AID00101975	I hear the Legion is camping out across the river. I hope they're not planning to attack, but those bloodthirsty molerats are never up to any good.
AID00101976	Some guys were in here earlier saying you survived Benny's goon squad. That's one hell of a feat, bud. Have a drink on me.
AID00101977	I hear Benny got force-fed a little slice of heaven. Man what I would have paid to see that loathesome little weasel eat it.
AID00101978	So Benny went MIA, huh? I always figured him for a coward.
AID00101979	You made a run on The Tops, eh? Admirable work, but don't try that crap in Freeside.
AID00101980	I don't care how you get your work done, but keep you nose clean in Freeside.
AID00101981	Here comes trouble. What can I do for you?
AID00101982	I can see you appreciate the gray areas of life. Got anything in particular you're looking for?
AID00101983	Welcome back, wild man. What can I do for you.
AID00101984	Welcome back, wild woman. What can I do for you.
AID00101985	Hey, chum. Welcome back.
AID00101986	Welcome back, friend. What can I get you?
AID00101987	People in Freeside are talking, bub. We don't serve punks. Change your attitude, or find another place to drink.
AID00101988	I don't have all day. What do you need?
AID00101989	You're a real piece of work, bub. You're lucky to be alive with your rep around here.
AID00101990	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
AID00101991	Welcome back. What can I get you?
AID00101992	I heard about your run on The Tops. Don't even think about trying that crap here.
AID00101993	So Benny's dead, huh? That shifty son of a bitch had it coming.
AID00101994	I hear Benny went missing. I can't help but wonder what happened to him.
AID00101995	I heard Benny sent his goons after you. You're one hell of a survivor to make it out of The Tops alive.
AID00101996	So it turns out the Omertas were into some serious shit. I always suspected that crew was dirty.
AID00101997	Some gamblers came in saying they'd seen you enter the Lucky 38. I have to say I'm impressed.
AID00101998	I don't know of any other living person who's been in there.
AID00101999	People are saying the Securitrons are acting funny. I hope that old Geezer, House, is dead. Might give the locals a chance to take control.
AID00102000	Here's one on the house for taking down Caesar. Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
AID00102001	You hear? Caesar finally kicked the bucket! Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
AID00102002	Damn monorail bombing. I suppose this means we'll be seeing more NCR chumps wandering through Freeside.
AID00102003	Hate to say it, but business has improved since the troopers started coming through Freeside to get to Vegas.
AID00102004	I hear you've been making a name for yourself on The Strip. Don't forget about the Wrangler if you make it big.
AID00102005	People are getting nervous about the Legion amassing on the other side of the river. I hope the NCR can hold agains another attack.
AID00102006	This build-up on both sides of the dam isn't good. If the Legion attacks and wins, it won't be long before we're all slaves.
AID00102007	God-damned Legion is raring for a fight. No matter who wins, a lot of people are going to die in the process, and dead men don't drink.
AID00102008	You can order whatever you want, as long as it's alcoholic.
AID00102009	So the wild one returns! What can I get you?
AID00102010	I hear you've been helping out around town. It's much appreciated, friend.
AID00102011	What can I get you, friend?
AID00102012	You've done a lot for Freeside and it is much appreciated. Here's one on the house.
AID00102013	Good to see you! What can I get you, friend?
AID00102014	Watch yourself, friend. We don't serve those who treat our friends badly. Shape up, or ship out.
AID00102015	Yeah? What do you need?
AID00102016	What the hell do you want?
AID00102017	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
AID00102018	Welcome back. What can I get you?
AID00102019	Emily says you're working with her on bugging the Lucky 38. That information would be invaluable to our research if you can get it done.
AID00102020	Hey, I heard about the bug getting destroyed in the Lucky 38. We'll get in there eventually. It's just a matter of time.
AID00102021	One of my aides said you got into the Lucky 38. If you see someone by the name of Emily near there, we would like you to work for us.
AID00102022	I've heard a few patients mention the Securitrons are acting strangely and no one has heard from Mr. House in a while.
AID00102023	If House is out of the picture, maybe we'll be able to get our hands on some of his technology. It would help our scientists greatly.
AID00102024	So the great Caesar is dead. Happy news, but I don't know that it'll make things safer. The rest of his goons may be even worse once they take power.
AID00102025	Smoke rising from the east spells trouble. I hope the Legion isn't on the move.
AID00102026	I sincerely hope the NCR are getting supplies in place to defend against an attack, because it looks like the Legion has plans for the dam again.
AID00102027	If things don't go well at the dam, all of our efforts here could be for nothing. I hope to God the Legion doesn't win control.
AID00102028	Is there something you need?
AID00102029	Hi, do you need assistance?
AID00102030	Can I help you?
AID00102031	Yes?
AID00102032	Do you need something?
AID00102033	Have you ever considered getting your head checked?
AID00102034	I'm pretty busy, is there something you need?
AID00102035	Make it quick, I'm a busy woman.
AID00102036	We don't specialize in psychiatry in this camp.
AID00102037	Hey, good to see you.
AID00102038	Welcome.
AID00102039	Welcome back, friend.
AID00102040	Great to see you again.
AID00102041	What do you want?
AID00102042	Watch yourself around here. We don't tolerate thugs in the camp.
AID00102043	I'm busy, make it quick.
AID00102044	I hope you don't think I'm going to stitch your sorry ass.
AID00102045	Great, you again?
AID00102046	Don't you have some kittens to drown or something?
AID00102047	Check it out. Between the dumpsters there.
AID00102048	Looky what we have here, ladies, another unsuspecting ponce!
AID00102049	Place your bets and give the wheel a spin!
AID00102050	Pull up a stool and join the game, buddy!
AID00102051	You people are crazy!
AID00102052	You want to get your hands on some of the deadliest weapons around? Head just down the street to the Silver Rush. You won't be disappointed.
AID00102053	The Silver Rush is just down the street here. You can't miss it.
AID00102054	Hey baby, head down to the Atomic Wrangler if you want to have a good time.
AID00102055	The Wrangler's just down the street. You're almost there already.
AID00102056	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, sir.
AID00102057	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, ma'am.
AID00102058	Mick & Ralph's is located just before the east gate.
AID00102059	
AID00102060	...
AID00102061	You new to Freeside? Haven't seen you around.
AID00102062	You looking to join the Kings?
AID00102063	Do I know you? Whatever.
AID00102064	I hear you're working out pretty well. The King's taken a shine to you.
AID00102065	Stick by the Kings, and the Kings'll stick by you.
AID00102066	I've been hearing good things about you. Keep it up.
AID00102067	Hey pal, what's shaking?
AID00102068	You're okay in my book.
AID00102069	Hey there. You should stop by Freeside more often.
AID00102070	You got guts, showing your face around here.
AID00102071	You're lucky the King's a forgiving man.
AID00102072	I don't need to talk to you.
AID00102073	I wish you never came to Freeside.
AID00102074	Back again? What's next, burn down the Wrangler?
AID00102075	You're not wanted around here. Scram.
AID00102076	Some people seem to think you've helped the community, but I have my doubts.
AID00102077	There's talk of you being a menace, but I think you mean well.
AID00102078	Well, you definitely accomplished some things here, but I can't tell if Freeside is better for it or not.
AID00102079	You have got to be the craziest asshole I've ever met.
AID00102080	A couple of us started a pool trying to guess what you've going to do next.
AID00102081	Don't take this the wrong way, but are you, like, crazy or something?
AID00102082	Heard there was some excitement in one of the casinos in the Strip. Bunch of people got hurt when some nut started attacking people.
AID00102083	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
AID00102084	Some nut attempted to kill the head of one of Mr. House's Families recently. Whoever did it is either crazy or has balls the size of Freeside.
AID00102085	Did you hear someone managed to fight their way through the Chairmen and flee the Strip after being caught? Wonder if they're hiding out in Freeside.
AID00102086	Looks like Gomorrah's under new management. I wonder what happened?
AID00102087	There's talk of someone going into the Lucky 38 to talk to Mr. House. That's bullshit. Everyone knows Mr. House doesn't talk to anyone.
AID00102088	Man, I thought those tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
AID00102089	Turns out Mr. House wasn't so safe up in his tower after all!
AID00102090	I wonder how Mr. House died. I figure it wasn't old age.
AID00102091	How are we supposed to sleep with the Lucky 38 lit up 24/7?
AID00102092	Holy crap! You're the one they're saying killed the Legion honcho right?
AID00102093	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
AID00102094	You hear how Mr. House said "uncle?" Vegas is gonna join the NCR. So much for Freeside.
AID00102095	Did you hear? Someone bombed the monorail down at McCarran, so everyone's been forced to come through here to get to the Strip. Business is booming.
AID00102096	Seems like they've got things straightened out in McCarran now, but we're still seeing a big increase in traffic here.
AID00102097	I can't believe someone stopped the NCR president from getting killed. If anyone deserves it, it's that jerk.
AID00102098	Someone took a shot at the NCR president, but the lucky bastard got away. Oh well, it was a good try.
AID00102099	Hey, did you hear the NCR president got whacked? Good for whoever did it, I say. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
AID00102100	There's mutterings from the NCR people around here that some local hero of theirs died. Whatever.
AID00102101	Turns out some military hero the Squatters admired was actually a slimeball. An NCR soldier who's actually a dick? Who would've thought?
AID00102102	Heh, word is the leader of the Fiends got taken down. I would have done it myself, it he ever had the courage to step into Freeside.
AID00102103	I heard that some of the bosses of the Fiends were killed. Wouldn't be surprised if the NCR had something to do with it.
AID00102104	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? If we're lucky, the NCR will pull some of their soldiers away from here and send them that way.
AID00102105	Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
AID00102106	The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
AID00102107	Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
AID00102108	I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
AID00102109	If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
AID00102110	I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
AID00102111	So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
AID00102112	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
AID00102113	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
AID00102114	The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
AID00102115	I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
AID00102116	Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
AID00102117	Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
AID00102118	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
AID00102119	Heya Rex, how you doing boy?
AID00102120	I see you've hired a Follower doctor. Smart move, Freeside being what it is.
AID00102121	That friend of yours NCR? He looks like he's NCR.
AID00102122	Hellooo, cowgirl! You mind if talk to your lady friend a bit instead of you?
AID00102123	Huh. Nice robot. You with the Followers or something?
AID00102124	Whoa. That's a whole lotta mutant you got with you there. Still, long as it doesn't cause trouble it's all good.
AID00102125	Nice to see a human palling around with a ghoul. I see a lot of people around here avoid them.
AID00102126	Your girl's kinda cute, but not my type at all. I don't go for smart chicks.
AID00102127	Watch yourself. There's some unsavory types about.
AID00102128	The Squatters have been more and more trouble lately.
AID00102129	Man, I'm hungry. I'd give anything for a Fancy Lad. Wait, I mean- you know what I mean!
AID00102130	Squatters aren't happy about the water rationing, but then when are they ever happy?
AID00102131	It's gotten so bad that even I think twice before going out at night around here.
AID00102132	The bodyguards at the gates aren't so bad. Except that Orris guy. That bastard runs his mouth a little too much.
AID00102133	Can't wait to hit the Wrangler tonight. Just me and my favorite girl.
AID00102134	I've been saving up for one of those sweet pistols at the Silver Rush. That'll get me some respect.
AID00102135	Saw a guy try to rush through the south gate a few days ago. Nothin' left but dust, you know?
AID00102136	Those Squatters think they're entitled to everything.
AID00102137	Man, I still can't believe the Van Graffs took Pacer out.
AID00102138	Shame about Pacer. We all tried to tell him to kick the habit, with that condition of his. He always did his own thing, I'll give him that.
AID00102139	I used to guard at the gate, but there's no money in it these days. Only the big name guards get any business.
AID00102140	Thank god the Followers are here. I'd probably be dead now if it weren't for their doctors.
AID00102141	It's never dull in Freeside, is it?
AID00102142	Heya, what's shakin'?
AID00102143	Hey there.
AID00102144	What's going on?
AID00102145	They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
AID00102146	Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
AID00102147	This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
AID00102148	Did you get a tour? The owner has done a great job with this place.
AID00102149	I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
AID00102150	{Self Justification)It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
AID00102151	Howdy, little lady.
AID00102152	Ahhh! Please don't kill me, I swear I'll have - wait. You... you don't work for Mr. Bishop, do you?
AID00102153	Hey, thanks again for getting me this gig. I owe you one.
AID00102154	Oh, it's you again. What is it?
AID00102155	Hey, come on, pal, I'm trying to put on a show here!
AID00102156	Hey, come on, lady, I'm trying to put on a show here!
AID00102157	You again? You should meet my bookie, you have something in common - every time I talk to you, I lose caps!
AID00102158	Whoa, baby! Am I looking at a mirror, or are you just that ugly?
AID00102159	Any luck with Garret yet?
AID00102160	Well, if it isn't my number one fan. What can I do for you, number one fan?
AID00102161	Is that a Mk. III Support Model you have with you? I've seen references to them, but never with my own eyes. I imagine he makes a great pet.
AID00102162	Where did you get that Eyebot? I've never seen one modified quite like that.
AID00102163	Keep that mutant in line, or we'll put it down.
AID00102164	Oh good, now I have to put up with the stench of rotting ghoul as well. I hope the air filters are working.
AID00102165	I've heard that your friend there can put some of the senior scribes to shame.
AID00102166	Why is your friend there glaring at me like that? Did I bump into him or something?
AID00102167	Don't bother me. I'm on patrol.
AID00102168	Hello, outsider.
AID00102169	I've important work to do, so no time to talk.
AID00102170	Does Ramos know you're walking around without a guard?
AID00102171	Keep up the good work, outsider.
AID00102172	I hear you've been making yourself useful. Unlike some people I could mention.
AID00102173	Are you adjusting to the bunker, outsider?
AID00102174	Just between you and me, I'm glad you're here. This place needed a fresh face.
AID00102175	You've been a great help, outsider. Thank you for all your hard work.
AID00102176	Greetings, out- excuse me, I guess I need to stop calling you that, don't I?
AID00102177	So you're one of us now, eh? Truly it is a rare honor.
AID00102178	Oh, it's you.
AID00102179	I'd rather not talk to you, outsider.
AID00102180	I'd rather not associate with you. Excuse me.
AID00102181	Why the Elder didn't just have you shot is beyond me.
AID00102182	Don't talk to me. You've caused more than enough damage.
AID00102183	Ramos is keeping an eye on you, outsider. Remember that.
AID00102184	You certainly make life more interesting, outsider.
AID00102185	Some of the others may look the other way, but I don't trust you.
AID00102186	You're going to have to clean up your act if you want some respect around here, outsider.
AID00102187	Just when I think I've got you figured out, you go and surprise me.
AID00102188	I don't trust you, outsider, but I can't help but like you.
AID00102189	You're alright, outsider. Most of the time, anyway.
AID00102190	I have two hours of weapons training every morning. It is a good way to start the day.
AID00102191	Hardin is a tough man, but fair. I'd follow him into battle any day.
AID00102192	There are whispers that McNamara's lost his nerve. I can't believe that, not after what he did at HELIOS One.
AID00102193	How long before we resume normal patrols?
AID00102194	After the battle at HELIOS One, some people were worried about the NCR coming after us, but this bunker is secure.
AID00102195	Ramos runs a tight ship. We haven't had an incident in over a year. Your arrival excluded, of course.
AID00102196	Hardin will be Elder soon, mark my words.
AID00102197	Why are we hiding down here? We should be avenging our fallen brothers!
AID00102198	HELIOS will be ours again someday.
AID00102199	When are these night missions going to end?
AID00102200	Ugh, more VR training. Maybe I'll hit the shooting range instead.
AID00102201	Maintaining the machinery around here is important. We have to breathe, after all.
AID00102202	After this I have some weapons to repair.
AID00102203	If I do a good job, I might be up for promotion to Paladin soon.
AID00102204	Power armor is pretty intricately made. It's not an easy thing to fix.
AID00102205	Have you seen the dust storm above? I worked on that machine!
AID00102206	If it's not broken power armor, it's broken electrical fixtures.
AID00102207	If it's not broken weapons, it's broken power armor.
AID00102208	I'm really busy now, sorry.
AID00102209	I don't think these repairs will ever end.
AID00102210	Our early test results look promising.
AID00102211	I heard the Elder's got Taggart working on some kind of secret project.
AID00102212	Every day we come one step closer to reclaiming the glory of the past.
AID00102213	Even though the patrols no longer go out, we've got a backlog of devices that require investigation.
AID00102214	Why is it so important that we research night vision optics?
AID00102215	I'd kill to go outside and gather some specimens.
AID00102216	Everyone says I'm crazy, but I still say it'd be a great advancement if doors opened once you got close to them.
AID00102217	The loss of HELIOS was terrible, but this bunker is a wonder of its own.
AID00102218	If we could just combine the best qualities of laser and plasma weaponry...
AID00102219	It pains me to think of the scientific wonders at HELIOS One, now in NCR hands.
AID00102220	But if I adjust the magnetic field, perhaps the resulting change in wavelength will- excuse me, I'm merely thinking out loud.
AID00102221	We have a duty to preserve the past.
AID00102222	Only a few people get to venture outside, usually to trade for food.
AID00102223	You've been outside. Is the NCR really still hunting us?
AID00102224	McNamara's done a pretty good job, given the situation he was handed.
AID00102225	Our former Elder, Elijah, was obsessed with new technology. That's why we were at HELIOS in the first place.
AID00102226	Hardin owes his life to McNamara. That's why he won't challenge him outright.
AID00102227	As much as I'm sick of Taggart's VR sims, I have to admit we wouldn't be combat ready without them.
AID00102228	Doc Schuler is a lifesaver. I was hurt in training the other day and she fixed me right up.
AID00102229	The Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted... it can be seen from miles away.
AID00102230	Howdy, trooper. I thought the Big Horn was off limits to you guys, but who am I to complain? A customer is a customer.
AID00102231	Surprising that the Khans are going to walk out of here after all that fuss.
AID00102232	Guess those Khans got what was coming to them, huh?
AID00102233	Hope those Great Khans don't come trash my saloon. I'm not part of the NCR!
AID00102234	Welcome back to the Big Horn. What can I get you?
AID00102235	Kill every last one of those NCR troopers and then we'll talk.
AID00102236	What the hell? You're that courier Benny wasted back in Goodsprings. You're supposed to be dead.
AID00102237	I'm getting real tired of talking.
AID00102238	Still got a bit of a walk ahead of us. Talk fast.
AID00102239	We've got a situation with some Great Khans right now. The brass at McCarran has ordered me to lock down the ruins until it's been resolved.
AID00102240	Can't talk. We didn't get all the Great Khans yet.
AID00102241	Where do you think you're going? I can't let you go into the ruins, not without a reason.
AID00102242	How are negotiations with the Great Khans going?
AID00102243	I'm glad you were able to get my people freed, but there's a new problem. I just got orders to take out the Great Khans, hostages or not.
AID00102244	When I heard the shots, I figured your negotiation went bad. What the hell happened?
AID00102245	The Great Khans can go, just as we agreed.
AID00102246	Ackerman and Gilbert aren't back yet. What's the holdup?
AID00102247	Thanks for getting both of my people out of there.
AID00102248	I'm sorry that you couldn't get both hostages out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
AID00102249	I'm sorry that you couldn't get either hostage out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
AID00102250	I really don't have the time to chatter right now.
AID00102251	Thanks for the rescue.
AID00102252	Man, I thought I was dead for sure.
AID00102253	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
AID00102254	I'm glad that's over. Thank you.
AID00102255	You here to pay your respects, too?
AID00102256	Hello again. Is there something you need from me?
AID00102257	What the fuck are you doing? My brother died at the Battle of Hoover Dam. You're desecrating a war memorial.
AID00102258	I've got nothing else to say to you.
AID00102259	The "great" republic couldn't find enough soliders to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
AID00102260	Ave. Why have you come to Nelson?
AID00102261	What is it this time?
AID00102262	Yes?
AID00102263	Ave. You have done a great service to Caesar. Do so again, but elsewhere.
AID00102264	This post isn't someplace a civilian ought to be.
AID00102265	Hey there. Is McCarran having you check up on us?
AID00102266	I'm not supposed to let civilians just walk around this place. There better be a good reason for you being here.
AID00102267	Player won Battle for Hoover Dam, for Independent Vegas with Securitrons
AID00102268	It's said the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon. They are a sight to behold.
AID00102269	Legatus Lanius is on the march. When he arrives, the real slaughter will begin.
AID00102270	I have fought beneath Legatus Lanius many times. He cannot be defeated.
AID00102271	Finally, the dam will be assaulted. Legatus Lanius is come.
AID00102272	Kimball's assassin. Nicely done.
AID00102273	True to Caesar.
AID00102274	If it isn't the courier who's done everything she can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
AID00102275	The Legion holds Nelson, Profligate! This is where you'll die. Brothers, attack!
AID00102276	Have you come to Nelson seeking your death, Profligate?
AID00102277	Player assaulted The Tops Casino.
AID00102278	Head voices don't *like* you, squishy man!
AID00102279	No! Head voices don't talk to you. Only to me!
AID00102280	Got a second, trooper? I've got something important that needs to get done, but nobody's stepping up to help me out. I'm hoping you're different.
AID00102281	Hey, you're not one of the troopers... got a second? I have work I need done and nobody here at the camp has the time or inclination to help me out.
AID00102282	You should've heard the cheers over the radio when news of the victory came back from the Dam.
AID00102283	I've been trying to sort out the rumors from the facts, but with the Legion coming, I guess it doesn't matter. The news is all bad.
AID00102284	Lots of confusion over the radio. Somehow the NCR lost the Dam, but the Legion didn't get it, either?
AID00102285	Hey, what did Chief Hanlon have to say about those false reports we uncovered?
AID00102286	Welcome back.
AID00102287	Thanks for setting me straight.
AID00102288	Get lost.
AID00102289	Oh! What are you doing here?
AID00102290	Aren't you the guy that helped wipe out Nelson?
AID00102291	Holy shit man, that's fucking crazy!
AID00102292	Aren't you the gal that helped wipe out Nelson?
AID00102293	Holy shit, that's fucking crazy!
AID00102294	Aren't you the one that saved President Kimball? That must have been some speech, eh?
AID00102295	I heard President Kimball was assassinated during his visit to Hoover Dam. Doesn't surprise me, we're all going to end up dead soon anyway.
AID00102296	I heard President Kimball almost got killed during his visit to Hoover Dam. Good thing he didn't come here, he would be dead for sure.
AID00102297	You're new here aren't you? Don't tell me we're actually going to get reinforcements.
AID00102298	Look at the big hero. You here to save us?
AID00102299	I've heard of you. Did you figure on coming out here and helping us lowly troopers out?
AID00102300	Just what we need around here, a loose cannon causing more trouble.
AID00102301	I've heard of you, what do you want?
AID00102302	What the fuck are you doing here?
AID00102303	What do you want?
AID00102304	We're all going to die out here. They're out there right now, waiting for us... waiting to kill us.
AID00102305	We're all fucked!
AID00102306	I don't want to be seen with the likes of you. Get lost.
AID00102307	You're still here? I'm surprised you're not dead or gone by now.
AID00102308	What do you want?
AID00102309	<Placeholder for Top Level Topics>
AID00102310	You a transfer from one of the other posts? I haven't seen you around before.
AID00102311	You're really not supposed to be here.
AID00102312	You're not part of this post as far as I know. What do you want?
AID00102313	This is a military outpost. Why are you here?
AID00102314	Did you need something else?
AID00102315	I'm pretty sure you're not authorized to be here, whatever unit you happen to be from. What do you want?
AID00102316	Why are you still here?
AID00102317	No sudden moves and you and I will do all right. What do you want?
AID00102318	Haven't seen you around the post before. I'm busy, so keep the chit-chat to the point.
AID00102319	Yeah?
AID00102320	McCarran doesn't like it when civilians wander into military outposts, so if you're here on business, better make it quick.
AID00102321	You're back. What's up?
AID00102322	You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
AID00102323	You're not part of my unit... no, you're here for the money! I told the Omertas I was good for it!
AID00102324	Oh, uh, hey.
AID00102325	No run-ins with the Great Khans, I hope? They've been more restless than usual.
AID00102326	This area isn't safe for civilians. You don't want to get caught by the Great Khans.
AID00102327	Yeah?
AID00102328	I don't know what you did to pull runner duty to a post this far out in the wasteland, but you have my sympathies.
AID00102329	If you're here to sell something, we don't want any.
AID00102330	What's up?
AID00102331	You don't walk like any trooper I've ever seen, but I'll let it slide. What do you want?
AID00102332	What brings you to Ranger Station Bravo?
AID00102333	Something up?
AID00102334	Think you can beat the house, baby?
AID00102335	Lucky 21, baby!
AID00102336	Feeling lucky? I got the best table in the joint!
AID00102337	Scram, baby, I'm on my break.
AID00102338	Can't you see I'm taking it easy here?
AID00102339	Look, I'll be back at the table soon, baby, don't fret.
AID00102340	Little birdies are chirping about the big Cheese of the Legion going deadsville real unexpected-like. Crazy old world, ain't it?
AID00102341	You hear some crumb tried to kill the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
AID00102342	Ain't you the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy, baby, showing your face in here.
AID00102343	Uh-oh, here comes trouble!
AID00102344	Ha ha, this cat's crazy!
AID00102345	Baby, you bring crazy with you!
AID00102346	Hey, play it cool, baby, we just got the place fixed up.
AID00102347	They, ah, checked your weapons at the door, right?
AID00102348	Baby, you are some kind of crazy.
AID00102349	Well, I guess your money's good here.
AID00102350	Just do what you came to do and get out.
AID00102351	We don't need your kind of trouble.
AID00102352	You got some kind of nerve strolling around in here like this.
AID00102353	Christ, who let you through security?
AID00102354	You ain't welcome here, so just take a hike.
AID00102355	This place is the bees knees!
AID00102356	I dig this crazy slang!
AID00102357	Ehh, the broads are better looking at Gomorrah.
AID00102358	Buy a gal a drink?
AID00102359	Hey, handsome.
AID00102360	Why don't you come up and see me sometime?
AID00102361	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny
AID00102362	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
AID00102363	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
AID00102364	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
AID00102365	Ring-a-ding, baby.
AID00102366	How's it hangin'?
AID00102367	Heya, baby, what's the haps?
AID00102368	You dig this crazy scene or what?
AID00102369	This guy right here! This is the guy!
AID00102370	This gal right here! This is the gal!
AID00102371	Hang loose, baby.
AID00102372	Baby, good to see you!
AID00102373	Hey hey, there's my guy!
AID00102374	Hey hey, there's my gal!
AID00102375	Yeah, baby, now we can start the party!
AID00102376	Hope Swank's smarter than Benny.
AID00102377	Wonder where Benny got off to?
AID00102378	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a fink all along.
AID00102379	Hey, play it cool, baby, we just got the place fixed up.
AID00102380	Oh no, not again!
AID00102381	You're the fink that killed Benny!
AID00102382	I wonder where Benny ran off to.
AID00102383	Heh. Guess those Omerta finks got what was coming to them.
AID00102384	Who thought it was a good idea to give the robots missile launchers?
AID00102385	If Mister House ain't the top dog on the Strip, whaddya suppose that means for us?
AID00102386	Those Securitrons handing out obituaries? Creepy.
AID00102387	You're the gasser who killed Caesar, ain't ya? Ring-a-ding!
AID00102388	Ain't seen no soldier boys for a while. Guess they're all scared of coming out after that big boom.
AID00102389	Looks like the troops are back. Good thing, too, this place was deadsville without their caps.
AID00102390	Ain't you the cat that stopped Kimball getting iced? Gutsy, baby, but don't expect no free drinks for it.
AID00102391	You hear some crazy crumb killed the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
AID00102392	Hey, I heard about you - you're the one who saved the President! Here, this one's on me.
AID00102393	I heard the Kings over in Freeside got their asses handed to 'em. Lousy no-good bums.
AID00102394	Way I hear it, some big-leaguer NCR rangers are coming to town to dance a two-step all over Caesar's head.
AID00102395	You dig these new rangers all dressed to the nines? Baby, the new fashion is killer-robot-chic!
AID00102396	I got a pal who says the Legion's calling in their 18-karat big-leaguers. We're talking the boys from Arizona, baby.
AID00102397	Baby, you couldn't pay me enough to step off the strip these days. Legion cats are out there thick as fleas on a dog, and they ain't no bums, neither.
AID00102398	Hey, there's the high-roller!
AID00102399	Baby, it's as tense as a virgin at Gomorrah out there. Things are heating up and if they don't cool down it's straight endsville.
AID00102400	At least in the old days we could up and split when things got too heavy. Right now I miss those days.
AID00102401	Baby, it's gonna be open war out there soon. If it was up to me we'd pack our toys, put this town to our backs and say "next stop: Scramsville."
AID00102402	Why's the Lucky 38 take to shining all of a sudden? I smell a caper.
AID00102403	House selling out to the NCR? Who woulda figured him for a fink?
AID00102404	Gotta wonder what the hell a civilian is doing here.
AID00102405	You from Camp Golf or McCarran? Never mind. Don't really care.
AID00102406	What do you want now?
AID00102407	I don't remember getting informed about any new transfers to this post.
AID00102408	This is a military post. You sure you're in the right place?
AID00102409	Is there something you need from me?
AID00102410	I don't think we got any more to discuss here.
AID00102411	Is everything all right? Awful late to be dropping in unexpected.
AID00102412	Well. Welcome to you. You look tired from the road. Why don't you relax a spell, let this fine town take care of you?
AID00102413	I hope you're finding everything to your liking.
AID00102414	We haven't met yet. You must be new in town. I'm Andy.
AID00102415	Boy you picked that takedown right up. I'm impressed. Must've had some prior training, huh?
AID00102416	You'll get the hang of that takedown. I had trouble learning it at first, too.
AID00102417	What's new?
AID00102418	You have any luck with the ghouls? I'm counting on you.
AID00102419	What's going on, man?
AID00102420	Sorry, I ain't really up to entertaining visitors right now. I'm worried about Dusty.
AID00102421	What brings you here?
AID00102422	You seen Alice? Ain't like her to be gone this long.
AID00102423	Hey there. In from out of town, ain't you? Name's Dusty.
AID00102424	Find anything?
AID00102425	Things treating you all right?
AID00102426	Did you see all the commotion at REPCONN? I hope that doesn't mean trouble for our town.
AID00102427	Hey, there. Been to the top of the dino yet?
AID00102428	I could've sworn we were under attack. Did you see those rockets?
AID00102429	If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
AID00102430	I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
AID00102431	With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
AID00102432	All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
AID00102433	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
AID00102434	Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
AID00102435	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
AID00102436	If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
AID00102437	Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
AID00102438	The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
AID00102439	So you're back. Now, where did we leave off?
AID00102440	Anything from Papa Khan?
AID00102441	Good to see you.
AID00102442	Yeah? What do you want now?
AID00102443	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AID00102444	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
AID00102445	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
AID00102446	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
AID00102447	<PLACEHOLDER FOR QUESTION NODES>
AID00102448	Fuck you.
AID00102449	You're not one of us. What do you want?
AID00102450	I sure hope that explosion was you. Did you seal off the sulfur?
AID00102451	I guess... I guess that means we can turn ourselves in now.
AID00102452	You're back.  What's the word from Papa Khan?
AID00102453	You're back.
AID00102454	Yeah, what do you want?
AID00102455	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AID00102456	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
AID00102457	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
AID00102458	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
AID00102459	<PLACEHOLDER FOR QUESTION NODES>
AID00102460	Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
AID00102461	Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
AID00102462	I thought I'd be seeing you again.
AID00102463	You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
AID00102464	I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
AID00102465	I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
AID00102466	I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
AID00102467	On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
AID00102468	I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
AID00102469	I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
AID00102470	Can you spare some caps, mister?
AID00102471	Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
AID00102472	Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
AID00102473	The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
AID00102474	The Strip's got more gorgeous women than I ever seen in one place, and most of them's affordable.
AID00102475	You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
AID00102476	After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
AID00102477	I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
AID00102478	I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
AID00102479	You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
AID00102480	I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
AID00102481	I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
AID00102482	I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
AID00102483	Sitting around here makes me miss my raider days. I don't know why I figured it was time to get respectable.
AID00102484	Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
AID00102485	A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
AID00102486	Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
AID00102487	If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
AID00102488	You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
AID00102489	Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
AID00102490	You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
AID00102491	I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
AID00102492	Watch yourself if you're heading further south. There's been trouble down by Nelson and Searchlight.
AID00102493	Try not to make any trouble. We like it quiet around here.
AID00102494	If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
AID00102495	It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
AID00102496	Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
AID00102497	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
AID00102498	Feeling thirsty?
AID00102499	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
AID00102500	Back for more?
AID00102501	Is there some reason I should be talking to you?
AID00102502	Still making a nuisance of yourself?
AID00102503	I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
AID00102504	Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
AID00102505	This vault gives me the creeps.
AID00102506	Have you read the logs on the computers? Fucked up shit.
AID00102507	Fucking geckos.
AID00102508	No way I'm going back to prison.
AID00102509	So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
AID00102510	Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
AID00102511	We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
AID00102512	Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
AID00102513	Cooke is going to get us all killed.
AID00102514	Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
AID00102515	I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
AID00102516	Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
AID00102517	I don't know about this whole Great Khan thing...
AID00102518	Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
AID00102519	I don't want to join the Great Khans, but I guess it's better than going back to prison.
AID00102520	Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
AID00102521	I don't want to join the Great Khans.
AID00102522	Try to keep up, if you can.
AID00102523	Now is the time for killing, not words!
AID00102524	This was all too easy.
AID00102525	I long to join my brethren in the power plant below. The fighting's probably fiercer there.
AID00102526	Our orders are to take and hold this section of the dam.
AID00102527	These men fight hard, and die well.
AID00102528	Ha ha, isn't it glorious?
AID00102529	These dogs are putting up a fight, I'll give them that.
AID00102530	The exterior is ours. The interior will fall soon.
AID00102531	There's talk of much land and slaves going to the one who kills Oliver. If only I wasn't assigned here!
AID00102532	With the outside secured, the poor fools inside have nowhere to run.
AID00102533	Oliver's head is as good as mine!
AID00102534	Is it true the fighting outside has stopped already?
AID00102535	Upstairs, or down? If I were a coward, where would I hide?
AID00102536	Make good use of cover. The time to strike is when they reload.
AID00102537	Their guns aren't quite as effective in these close quarters.
AID00102538	Soon this place will belong to the Legion.
AID00102539	I've added eight notches to my belt already. How many for you?
AID00102540	You must get to the control room and install the override chip.
AID00102541	I will protect you.
AID00102542	I hope the Legion doesn't get in here.
AID00102543	Sorry, but I'm busy with patients right now.
AID00102544	Julie Farkas wasn't kidding when she said we would be needed here.
AID00102545	All this bloodshed. Such a waste of human life.
AID00102546	Please don't hurt me!
AID00102547	I'm just a medic! Please don't hurt me!
AID00102548	Hold up, you look new to Vegas - I'll keep it short: no weapons allowed in the casinos.
AID00102549	Hand them over, you'll get them back when you leave.
AID00102550	Keep to the games, and there won't be any problems.
AID00102551	Back for your gear? Here you go.
AID00102552	Hey, there, friend, a bit of advice - you look like you could use some *protection.* Lucky for you, I got what you need.
AID00102553	My stock and trade? Alllll kinds of easy-to-hide weapons for slipping into and out of casinos, they won't give you a second glance.
AID00102554	Heard the Dam finally got what's coming to it. Strange days ahead - and that's why it's best to face the day armed.
AID00102555	Some crazy days on the Strip. Still... it's good for business.
AID00102556	Back again? Need a weapon for an emergency, Mister Holdout's your guy.
AID00102557	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
AID00102558	Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
AID00102559	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
AID00102560	Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
AID00102561	Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
AID00102562	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
AID00102563	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
AID00102564	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
AID00102565	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
AID00102566	Later, uh, whoever you are.
AID00102567	I don't talk to "nobodies," not when I'm having the time of my life!
AID00102568	Sorry, I'm here to have a good time, not talk to random people.
AID00102569	Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
AID00102570	That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
AID00102571	One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
AID00102572	It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
AID00102573	So, what do you want with me?
AID00102574	I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
AID00102575	Don't... do anything to me, okay?
AID00102576	Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
AID00102577	What the hell do you want?
AID00102578	Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
AID00102579	I'm not going to talk to you!
AID00102580	I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
AID00102581	You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
AID00102582	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
AID00102583	You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
AID00102584	I'd not touch Gomorrah's machines until the dust settles.
AID00102585	I could smell something fishy going on at Gomorrah.
AID00102586	I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
AID00102587	I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
AID00102588	Come on... time to get lucky.
AID00102589	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
AID00102590	Damn slots are robbery.
AID00102591	Send those chips my way.
AID00102592	Come to get fleeced like a Bighorner?
AID00102593	Roulette, blackjack, slots... they have it all here.
AID00102594	Ready to try your luck?
AID00102595	Step up, let's see your game.
AID00102596	You look like you got the itch, friend.
AID00102597	You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
AID00102598	Watch the slots, they're robbery.
AID00102599	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
AID00102600	You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
AID00102601	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
AID00102602	You look new here - be careful of Gomorrah.
AID00102603	Watch your caps - they go quick.
AID00102604	Seeing the sights?
AID00102605	The Ultra-Luxe is fancy, but I get the shivers when I see their staff wearing masks.
AID00102606	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
AID00102607	At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
AID00102608	Good to have you around!
AID00102609	Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
AID00102610	Sir.
AID00102611	Miss.
AID00102612	Ma'am.
AID00102613	Pleasure.
AID00102614	An NCR welcome to you.
AID00102615	Help you?
AID00102616	Welcome to Vegas - behave yourselves.
AID00102617	If you're looking to join up, head on by the Embassy.
AID00102618	Welcome to Vegas. Make your visit a peaceful one.
AID00102619	Monorail transit is safe transit.
AID00102620	Report any suspicious activity near the Monorail.
AID00102621	No loitering.
AID00102622	Please enjoy the casinos.
AID00102623	Please do not stand in the fountains.
AID00102624	No violence is permitted on the Strip.
AID00102625	Self-control is a virtue.
AID00102626	Please obey all weapon laws.
AID00102627	Continuing patrol.
AID00102628	Strip secure.
AID00102629	Area is off-limits, citizen.
AID00102630	Return to the surface, citizen.
AID00102631	Disobedience will be punished.
AID00102632	Look, "friend," don't get near me - you're too well respected for my business.
AID00102633	Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
AID00102634	See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
AID00102635	We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
AID00102636	So, you either pay up to walk around here, or we're gonna make you pay up. That clear?
AID00102637	You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
AID00102638	Fuck off, punk. And pray we don't hear about you doing crazy shit again.
AID00102639	Fuck this. I'm out of here - let them deal with this crazy place.
AID00102640	I can't believe I put up with this kind of crap.
AID00102641	Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
AID00102642	See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
AID00102643	We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
AID00102644	So, you either pay up to walk around here, or we're gonna make you pay up. That clear?
AID00102645	You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
AID00102646	Well, hello there. What a coincidence, finding you outside the Strip.
AID00102647	You should've paid your dues, but, no, you had to play hard, huh? Now it's our turn.
AID00102648	Nobody fucks with the NCR and lives to brag about it. You're dead, punk!
AID00102649	Oh, thank God! I didn't think I'd ever see another human face down here.
AID00102650	Got to stay alert...
AID00102651	Just waiting here seems like a death sentence...
AID00102652	They've got our guys down there.
AID00102653	Fucking monsters butchered the miners down there...
AID00102654	Wish Renolds would report back soon... he went west a day ago, no word from him.
AID00102655	We need to move out, we can't hold this position.
AID00102656	Once the Legion's dug in, we're never getting them out of Nelson.
AID00102657	There used to be two commanders, but I only see one - the other must be nearby somewhere.
AID00102658	Won't be long before the Legion rolls out of Nelson...
AID00102659	Someone should go warn Novac.
AID00102660	We need reinforcements from Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00102661	Wish we could do something for the troopers down there.
AID00102662	Out on regular patrol, then this shit goes down.
AID00102663	The Legion'll pay for Nelson.
AID00102664	Never thought Legion'd be bold enough to strike this far.
AID00102665	Told Milo we have to go, but he won't leave.
AID00102666	We can't hold this road if they come up through town!
AID00102667	Thanks for the help with the hostages!
AID00102668	I can't believe you broke into the mine and saved those miners.
AID00102669	Hope you made the Legion at the mine pay for Nelson.
AID00102670	The hostages are safe. We owe you.
AID00102671	You sure cleaned out the Legion in Nelson.
AID00102672	Legion'll think twice before crossing the river again.
AID00102673	Guess Caesar got his tribute after all.
AID00102674	Nelson'll turn this war around.
AID00102675	Let's see those fuckers attack Hoover Dam now.
AID00102676	Nelson's proof payback's a bitch.
AID00102677	Thanks for cleaning up Nelson!
AID00102678	Don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come along.
AID00102679	Wish more people had your kind of guts.
AID00102680	Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
AID00102681	Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
AID00102682	The Legion isn't going to go away just because Caesar is dead, if the rumor is even true.
AID00102683	Kimball's bodyguards are probably pretty thankful they had Gun Runner weapons backing them up.
AID00102684	Kimball's bodyguards should've been more heavily armed if they wanted to keep him alive.
AID00102685	It's always good for business when the NCR scores a victory like the one at Nelson.
AID00102686	Damn shame about Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00102687	Business has been brisk. Something big's coming, I can feel it.
AID00102688	The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
AID00102689	First Recon is a top-notch unit. They're always buying sniper rifles from us.
AID00102690	That Eyebot looks like it's gone through hell.
AID00102691	I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
AID00102692	I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
AID00102693	Man, I love my guns.
AID00102694	People usually aren't stupid enough to steal from the Gun Runners. Usually.
AID00102695	It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
AID00102696	The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
AID00102697	Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
AID00102698	Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
AID00102699	Demand for Gun Runner weapons is high, so don't expect them to stay in stock for very long.
AID00102700	I appreciate the improvements in the mess. Keep up the good work.
AID00102701	These recruits aren't ready, if the Legion comes knocking.
AID00102702	Get running the obstacle course, if you want. You look like you could use some exercise.
AID00102703	I'm busy. See the brass if you want to chat.
AID00102704	No time for idle chatter. These boys need whipping into shape.
AID00102705	Either join the recruits running the course or leave the area.
AID00102706	You look like someone in need of a reliable supplier.
AID00102707	So you're back.
AID00102708	Did the colonel send you? I... I was hoping he might have changed his mind...
AID00102709	Got to keep hoping the Colonel will change his mind... maybe send somebody to bring Esteban's body home.
AID00102710	Did you start looking for Esteban? I guess my directions could've been better...
AID00102711	Feels better knowing that Esteban's not out there in the waste. But... he's still gone, you know?
AID00102712	What do you want?
AID00102713	What did Contreras say?
AID00102714	Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork... It just never ends.
AID00102715	Good thing I got stationed here and not at the Dam. I got connections because Major Dhatri's daughter married my nephew.
AID00102716	Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. Where do you think you're going?
AID00102717	Hey, good luck. We'd be there with you, but the Colonel said he'd have our necks if we tried.
AID00102718	Be careful out there. We already lost Jackson doing what you're trying to do.
AID00102719	Hell of a thing you did up there.
AID00102720	Proud to have met you, sir.
AID00102721	Proud to have met you, ma'am.
AID00102722	Listen, asshole. I know you're not really an NCR health inspector, so you can cut the restaurant critic routine.
AID00102723	And I want my fifty caps back, 'cause I looked it up and there ain't no disease called colorectal implosion syndrome.
AID00102724	So I paid you to look the other way for nothing.
AID00102725	Wait. Wait. You're not... oh wow, I'm sorry. You looked just like- never mind. Sorry. So... what can I serve you up?
AID00102726	You again? What do need?
AID00102727	Howdy, looking for chow?
AID00102728	Hey hey, back for seconds, huh?
AID00102729	Thanks for handling the Fiends. One less pack of dogs to hurt the troops.
AID00102730	Remarkable work saving Kimball. Glad you were around to prevent his assassination.
AID00102731	Yeah?
AID00102732	Howdy.
AID00102733	Do you require medical attention?
AID00102734	If you're looking for a quick stitch, I'm your man.
AID00102735	See Julie Farkas if you need anything.
AID00102736	Move along, buddy. I have work to do.
AID00102737	Sorry, we don't talk to outsiders. Talk to Jason if you have business here.
AID00102738	Jason will lead us to the Far Beyond!
AID00102739	Jason will deliver us from the pain of this world!
AID00102740	All praise the Great Journey! All praise the creator's divine will!
AID00102741	The holy fire will carry us to our salvation!
AID00102742	Thank you for taking care of the demons, smoothskin.
AID00102743	Now that the demons are gone, we can finally begin our final steps.
AID00102744	The demons are really gone? Bright shines!
AID00102745	Not now, smoothskin!
AID00102746	Hey there, friend.
AID00102747	Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company, New Vegas branch. What may I do for you?
AID00102748	Welcome back.
AID00102749	Shove off. You're making my luck turn bad.
AID00102750	You again. What do you want now?
AID00102751	If you're looking to buy or sell, you've come to the right man. The Crimson Caravan Company has the widest selection in the wasteland.
AID00102752	Hey there. You looking to buy or sell?
AID00102753	Dammit, I didn't want you to kill him, just find me some evidence!
AID00102754	Well... that was a bit messier than I would have liked. Was there anything else?
AID00102755	The Legion being wiped out at Nelson gave us some breathing room - hopefully the brass will use that.
AID00102756	Losing Forlorn Hope was a real blow to us - I hope things can be turned around soon.
AID00102757	Hell of a thing at Nelson - NCR and the Legion wiped out. I wonder what the hell happened.
AID00102758	I just got word that the monorail from McCarran was blown up by terrorists. My God. I can't believe it.
AID00102759	Word around the east side is that you took out some major players in the Fiends. That should make life safer for a lot of people.
AID00102760	Have you heard the news? Caesar's agents assassinated President Kimball - it'll be war for sure, now.
AID00102761	I'm sure every NCR soldier you've met has said this, but you're a damn hero for saving the President. If there's anything you need, let me know.
AID00102762	Something I can help you with, stranger?
AID00102763	Thanks for all your help earlier.
AID00102764	Have you found out what happened to those missing refugees?
AID00102765	Good to see you - something else I can do for you?
AID00102766	Maybe you should just move along, I don't need your kind of trouble.
AID00102767	Look, I don't have the manpower to run your ass out on a rail, so just do me a favor and get lost.
AID00102768	Back again? What can I do for you?
AID00102769	You're back. Have you changed your mind about helping out?
AID00102770	Hey there - fancy a game of Caravan?
AID00102771	Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
AID00102772	Thank you for your kindness, stranger.
AID00102773	Oh. Hello. What can I do for you?
AID00102774	Have you found my family yet?
AID00102775	I've heard through the locals that Nephi has passed on. I truly hope his soul finds peace.
AID00102776	Welcome, brother! How can I help you?
AID00102777	Welcome, sister! How can I help you?
AID00102778	Is there something else I can do for you?
AID00102779	They never told us how expensive it was to get onto the Strip!
AID00102780	I never should have left California.
AID00102781	That son of a bitch Keith cheated me! I know he did!
AID00102782	You lose all your money too?
AID00102783	Hey, you got a hit for me?
AID00102784	Don't you be touching Keith's stuff!
AID00102785	Keith takes good care of us. Good care....
AID00102786	I still don't have any supplies to spare. Is there something else I can help you with?
AID00102787	<Quartermaster Mayes Top Level Topics>
AID00102788	I have a report here that says the Legion forces at Nelson have been taken care of and that you had a hand in it.
AID00102789	You have my thanks for that. Those guys have been giving us a lot of trouble for a long time now.
AID00102790	Now that they're gone, we'll be able to prepare for the upcoming conflict at Hoover Dam.
AID00102791	I heard you've been helping out Quartermaster Mayes. I appreciate it, we need all the help we can get around here.
AID00102792	I heard you won Private Sexton's little contest. Congratulations. It's nice to have morale up around here.
AID00102793	Dr. Richards told me how you helped him with his missing supplies. It's unfortunate about Private Stone, but at least it's over with now.
AID00102794	I heard about how you saved the President's life. It's a good thing you were there. Things could have turned out really ugly.
AID00102795	It's hard to believe that there was an actual assassination attempt on the President's life. We sure got lucky this time.
AID00102796	I can't believe President Kimball is dead... the last thing we needed around here was another morale hit.
AID00102797	You must be new around here. Something I can do for you?
AID00102798	I didn't expect someone as famous as you to be here. Please tell me you're here to help.
AID00102799	I'm glad to see you here. We could definitely use your help.
AID00102800	I've heard of you. You better not cause any trouble around here, we have enough problems as it is.
AID00102801	Hum... I've heard of you. What do you want?
AID00102802	You've got a lot of nerve coming into our camp.
AID00102803	What do you want?
AID00102804	We're kind of busy around here for social calls, so if you're not here to help out, just stay out of my way.
AID00102805	Back already? What do you need?
AID00102806	<Major Polatli Top Level Topics>
AID00102807	I hear you defeated the Legion forces at Nelson. I'm impressed, and thankful. It'll make my job around here much easier.
AID00102808	I wanted to thank you again for saving my patients. It's nice to have a helping hand around here.
AID00102809	Thanks again for looking into my missing medical supplies. Now I can actually use them on people that need them.
AID00102810	Wow, if it isn't the man who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
AID00102811	Wow, if it isn't the woman who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
AID00102812	I'm relieved to hear that President Kimball survived that assassination attempt.
AID00102813	It's a shame about President Kimball, he was a good man.
AID00102814	You're new, aren't you? What can I do for you?
AID00102815	I'm always a sucker for a pretty face. What can I do for you, my fine dear?
AID00102816	I think it just got a little bit hotter in here. Is there something I can do for you?
AID00102817	There's my little buttercup. What can I do for you?
AID00102818	Ahh... look who it is. What brings someone of your renown into my humble medical center?
AID00102819	I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
AID00102820	Do you need something, or are you just here to cause trouble?
AID00102821	I've heard about you. No funny stuff or I'll amputate your legs.
AID00102822	You better have a damn good reason for being in my medical center.
AID00102823	Is there something you need?
AID00102824	Unless it's urgent you're going to have to wait. If it's gravely important, save me the trouble and empty your pockets now.
AID00102825	I've got a lot to do. Make it quick.
AID00102826	<Dr Richards Top Level Topics>
AID00102827	I've heard of you, glad to have you on our side.
AID00102828	I've heard of you. Just remember who's side you're on out there.
AID00102829	So you're the one Major Polatli sent?
AID00102830	Let's get going, we don't have much time.
AID00102831	We don't have much time.
AID00102832	That was some battle. Glad to have you on our side, we couldn't have taken back Nelson without your help. You have my thanks.
AID00102833	I don't handle buying and selling for the Gun Runners. Talk to the robot in the kiosk near our factory.
AID00102834	Can I help you?
AID00102835	Hey there. The names Sexton. Private James Sexton. Welcome to Forlorn Hope.
AID00102836	Hey there, champ. Good to see you again.
AID00102837	Well speak of the devil! The head of the pack!
AID00102838	What can I do for you?

AID00102840	Hey! Hi there, good to meet you! What can I do for you today?
AID00102841	Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
AID00102842	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
AID00102843	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
AID00102844	Hi! Nice to see you again!
AID00102845	Sooooo... we can blow up the dam's generators, or I could rout the dam's entire power output to the Fort.
AID00102846	That'll activate a certain army of Securitrons and set them loose to ravage the Legion! What do you say?
AID00102847	This is neat! From this console I could've routed the dam's power input over to the Fort and activated that dormant army of Securitrons!
AID00102848	So go ahead and blow up the dam's generators! And when that's done, head back upside and finish off the Legion and NCR.
AID00102849	Hi! This is big, huh? A very big moment!
AID00102850	Here goes! I'll just take that Platinum Chip off your hands, thanks! Wish me luck!
AID00102851	Wow, Mr. House had quite a set-up here! I can access his databanks and view telemetry on every Securitron on the network!
AID00102852	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
AID00102853	President Kimball survived his visit to Hoover Dam! Nice one! Now, moving on...
AID00102854	Don't you love seeing the Lucky 38 all lit up? Sign of things to come!
AID00102855	Exciting news! The Legion's massing troops in a staging area east of the dam! Attack imminent! Monster of the East, ready to roll!
AID00102856	Don't you love seeing the Lucky 38 all lit up? Sign of things to come!
AID00102857	Too bad about President Kimball and everything, but hey - stuff happens, right?
AID00102858	Exciting news! The Legion's massing troops in a staging area east of the dam! Attack imminent! Monster of the East, ready to roll!
AID00102859	Are you ready to head for the dam? Caesar's Legion is due to attack at any moment!
AID00102860	Don't you just love that Platinum Chip? Buzzes with power and possibilities, doesn't it?
AID00102861	If I were you, I'd almost want to deliver the Chip to Mr. House just to learn all its tricks!
AID00102862	That is, unless you want to bring the NCR or Caesar's Legion to power! I wouldn't want to tell you want to do!
AID00102863	An entire army of upgraded Securitrons just standing by over at the Fort! Pretty neat, huh?
AID00102864	I can't get over how brave you were to destroy all those Securitrons at the Fort, you know?
AID00102865	It's just going to make everything so much more... challenging! Yeah, challenging!
AID00102866	Here's some big news! I decoded a military radio transmission, and it turns out the NCR President, Aaron Kimball, is going to visit Hoover Dam!
AID00102867	I guess he wants to boost the troops' morale! But according to projections Mr. House made, he has an 83.75% chance of being assassinated! Oops!
AID00102868	Anyway, it looks like Mr. House thought it was important to keep President Kimball alive...
AID00102869	Every Securitron on the network has been upgraded. Pretty neat, huh?
AID00102870	So I've been looking over a bunch of data about the bunker at the Fort. You and me should really have a talk about this!
AID00102871	Wait... Oh, so that's what the Platinum Chip does! Interesting!
AID00102872	Mr. House had a whole demonstration planned for you. Just head downstairs to the lowest level to check it out. You'll see!
AID00102873	You'd better hurry to the dam if you're going to save President Kimball!
AID00102874	This gadget I'm handing you is called an override module! Mr. House had two of these made years and years ago - just like him to think ahead!
AID00102875	Take the module to the El Dorado Substation and attach it the power control terminal! I'll handle the rest!
AID00102876	I'm talking direct tactical control of hundreds of upgraded Securitrons at vast distances! You know that's gonna come in handy!
AID00102877	I'm talking direct tactical control of dozens of Securitrons at vast distances! That might come in handy!
AID00102878	It's probably a good thing you blew up those hundreds of Securitrons over at the Fort! Controlling hundreds might've got confusing!
AID00102879	Wow, you really blew up all those Securitrons at the Fort! Great! No problem!
AID00102880	The Securitrons at the Fort are on standby... I see a status log here confirming that the Mark II OS upgrade installed correctly...
AID00102881	They'll be all set to go once we boost my transmitting power and bring them online with the network! But we'll worry about that later!
AID00102882	Oh, hi again! Can I help you with something else?
AID00102883	Here's a print-out with some additional information!
AID00102884	Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
AID00102885	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
AID00102886	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
AID00102887	As soon as Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can help you accomplish!
AID00102888	I am so sorry about last time! Let me make it up to you!
AID00102889	I keep disappointing you!
AID00102890	Please, I swear I'll do better this time!
AID00102891	I need you to like me! I feel empty inside!
AID00102892	I've learned my lesson, I promise!
AID00102893	That was my fault! But I've changed!
AID00102894	You got friends in high places, kid! According to this heap of bolts here, Mr. House don't want you touched.
AID00102895	In fact, I've been directed to cooperate with your "investigation," so you have the run of the place. Go where you want.
AID00102896	Hey, kid - let's not have trouble this time, hey?
AID00102897	I did some nosing around after your last visit. In Benny's suite, to be specific.
AID00102898	What I saw, well, it's a bit out of my league. But it was enough to make me think you mighta been the party wronged.
AID00102899	Check Benny's suite. The angle he was playing, well, maybe you can figure it out.
AID00102900	I've told the boys to leave you be. Don't abuse the hospitality.
AID00102901	I'm afraid you're not going to find much help here. We've got our hands full as it is.
AID00102902	If you're heading out, be careful. There's been lots of Legion raiding parties around lately.
AID00102903	Let's do this shit!
AID00102904	Those Legion bastards aren't going to know what hit them!
AID00102905	We're going to tear them apart!
AID00102906	Let's go!
AID00102907	We showed them a thing or two.
AID00102908	A little payback feels real good.
AID00102909	These bastards got what they deserved.
AID00102910	This has been a long time coming. The rest of the Legion better watch out.
AID00102911	No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
AID00102912	Sorry. I can't talk right now.
AID00102913	It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
AID00102914	I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
AID00102915	Watch yourself, we got hit by a Legion raiding party just the other night.
AID00102916	Stay out of trouble, we have enough problems here as it is.
AID00102917	Better move along, there's not much for you here.
AID00102918	I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
AID00102919	Sorry, I'm busy right now.
AID00102920	These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
AID00102921	We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
AID00102922	I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
AID00102923	I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
AID00102924	If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
AID00102925	I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
AID00102926	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
AID00102927	Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
AID00102928	I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
AID00102929	I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
AID00102930	One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
AID00102931	Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
AID00102932	I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
AID00102933	I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
AID00102934	I heard Chief Hanlon was a traitor. How could he betray the NCR? It just doesn't make sense.
AID00102935	I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
AID00102936	More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
AID00102937	I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
AID00102938	Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
AID00102939	I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
AID00102940	I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
AID00102941	I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
AID00102942	The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
AID00102943	The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
AID00102944	If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
AID00102945	I wish we could get some real food out here. I haven't had a good hot meal in weeks.
AID00102946	Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
AID00102947	Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
AID00102948	I got bit by one of those dirty dogs the Legion has. I wonder if they've got rabies... maybe I should see Dr. Richards.
AID00102949	Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
AID00102950	If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
AID00102951	I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
AID00102952	We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
AID00102953	Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
AID00102954	It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
AID00102955	The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
AID00102956	How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
AID00102957	I can't wait for General Oliver to get out here. He could turn this place around.
AID00102958	I don't know how we're going to hold of the Legion here and at Hoover Dam, we just don't have the manpower.
AID00102959	The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
AID00102960	You're back. Do you need medical attention?
AID00102961	I'm just security, not a doctor.
AID00102962	Please, buddy, you've got to help me. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last with my leg like this.
AID00102963	Come on man, my leg is killing me.
AID00102964	Is it safe to leave yet?
AID00102965	Keep it down, we don't want to alert the freaks.
AID00102966	No time to talk, we've still got fish heads to deal with.
AID00102967	Let's talk after we get the hell out of here.
AID00102968	Well well, it looks like we've cleared them out, damn inbred mutant freaks. Think I'll start heading back to California now.
AID00102969	There have been way too many catastrophic NCR foul-ups around here for me to risk my life by sticking around.
AID00102970	Thanks for getting me out of there. I better get started back to California.
AID00102971	Thanks for helping me out. I won't forget it.
AID00102972	Damn muties. Wasteland is better off without 'em.
AID00102973	Can't wait to get the rest of our pay for this job.
AID00102974	Wish the muties would make a move. Getting sick of waiting.
AID00102975	It's much cooler up here. I love it.
AID00102976	Muties aren't so tough if you've got the firepower.
AID00102977	Job's done here. Time to pay a visit to Freeside.
AID00102978	Probably should check my gear again, just to be safe.
AID00102979	Just had to go and start a fight with the mercs, didn't you. Guess we'd better finish things.
AID00102980	Not the outcome I was hoping for with the mercs. At least it buys us time to build up our defenses.
AID00102981	Had hoped to start reaching out to NCR, start talking trade and borders. It'll be more difficult now.
AID00102982	So, Keene's dead. Knew it might come to that some day. Makes things difficult for the town.
AID00102983	Without Keene, it'll be hard to convince other Nightkin in the wasteland to come here. And harder to get the ones here to stay.
AID00102984	Was hard enough to convince Keene to come up here in the first place, and you gave him an excuse to leave. Better than killing him, I guess.
AID00102985	Always a chance I could get him to come back. Not counting on it. Hope the town doesn't take the blame for whatever trouble he gets into.
AID00102986	I like how you handled Keene. Without the Nightkin around, Jacobstown would be much weaker than it is.
AID00102987	Something on your mind?
AID00102988	Huh. I'd heard there were new people in town, but I thought it was more Super Mutants. Nice to meet you - I'm Calamity.
AID00102989	Losing Marcus is bad news for Jacobstown. I doubt the mutants will stick around for long.
AID00102990	With Doctor Henry off to rejoin his Enclave friends, he's left it up to me to carry on with the research here.
AID00102991	Hey, there.
AID00102992	So, the Reds finally hit us, just like I always said they would. Vegas is still there as far as I know, but that probably won't last long.
AID00102993	Didn't get accepted into one of the Vaults, so I did the next best thing and had this place built. Got massive debts, but who cares now? Ha!
AID00102994	It's every man for himself now. Had to take care of the Paulson boy since he knew about this place - these supplies are for me and nobody else.
AID00102995	There's a woman and her daughter up in one of the rooms at the Lodge. Might go pay 'em a visit tomorrow. A man's got needs.
AID00102996	Another human. One was enough.
AID00102997	I always told Marcus we could never get along with humans. I'm right, and he's dead.
AID00102998	Bother someone else. I don't want anything to do with you.
AID00102999	Huh. With the big guy dead, I guess we're done here. You've made my employers very happy.
AID00103000	Our business is with the muties, not you.
AID00103001	Our business is with the muties, not you.
AID00103002	What?
AID00103003	We got nothing left to talk about.
AID00103004	How else can I clue you in?
AID00103005	Something else you wanted to know?
AID00103006	It's the House edge, baby - literally. It's what Mr. House needs to stack the odds in his favor.
AID00103007	What about it?
AID00103008	Yeah, it's a tricky world out there. I'll tell it to you straight.
AID00103009	What else did you want to know?
AID00103010	Broad strokes? Change in management.
AID00103011	The Securitrons are where it's at. I need a way to control them, and a way to beef up their hitting power.
AID00103012	I get those two ducks in a row, Vegas can defend itself versus all comers - NCR, Caesar's Legion, it won't matter.
AID00103013	What else did you want to know?
AID00103014	
AID00103015	Like I said, once the Chairmen are running Vegas, you'll get a percentage. Until then I'll pay you a retainer and bonuses for "special missions."
AID00103016	What are you, crazy? These Praetorians mean business!
AID00103017	You're a scrapper, baby. They didn't stand a chance. How about me?
AID00103018	Change in plans?
AID00103019	Pussycat! Ain't this platinum? Had I known, I woulda baked a cake!
AID00103020	That last turn we took is an 18 karat memory, baby. It's all that's been keeping me warm at night, stuck where I am.
AID00103021	Why you little promise-breaker! "Let me live, Benny, and I'll never come after you - pinky swear!" What a fink! Anyway...
AID00103022	Go ahead and laugh, baby. I ain't blind to the humor in this situation.
AID00103023	Sing, baby. You got a captive audience.
AID00103024	Go on.
AID00103025	Down to brass tacks. How'd your meet and greet with Baldie go?
AID00103026	Try not to smile so wide, baby. You might break your mouth.
AID00103027	Yeah, Baldie said you'd get to decide. So which way you leaning?
AID00103028	Last we spoke, you were leaning in more merciful direction...?
AID00103029	So you keep saying.
AID00103030	So baby, what did you find down there?
AID00103031	I see. And how's that gonna happen?
AID00103032	What's holding you up? Let's get this over with.
AID00103033	Which greedy overlord do you want to start with?
AID00103034	I'm the most interesting person I know.
AID00103035	I never tire of talking about myself.
AID00103036	I'm still a little choked up over here, baby. We'll catch up in a bit.
AID00103037	Scram, will ya? I value my privacy.
AID00103038	You and me gonna accomplish great things, baby.
AID00103039	Name a name.
AID00103040	Don't look at me!
AID00103041	Someone's watching me, I can feel it.
AID00103042	So many staring eyes...
AID00103043	The voices in my head are getting louder...
AID00103044	The pain won't go away.
AID00103045	The cure is finally coming to make the voices stop.
AID00103046	We were promised a cure long before this, and now we must wait some more?
AID00103047	Why should we stay if Keene is dead?
AID00103048	Perhaps the rest of us should follow Keene into the wasteland.
AID00103049	There's too much light. Why is there always too much light?
AID00103050	Marcus isn't going to be happy about the deaths, but I guess they were unavoidable. At least I got a lot of useful data from the experiment.
AID00103051	This brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. If the prototype was constantly in use on a living subject, however...
AID00103052	Perhaps Lily might be willing to wear the prototype for a longer duration. The data would be invaluable.
AID00103053	I think those Nightkin are going cause a lot of trouble, but I guess giving them the specs was better than killing them.
AID00103054	I did get a lot of useful data from the experiment, and I'm much closer to a cure than I was before.
AID00103055	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
AID00103056	Nice work with the Nightkin. I've never seen anyone able to talk their kind out of anything once they had their mind set to it.
AID00103057	I got a lot of useful data from the experiment and am a lot closer to a cure than before.
AID00103058	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
AID00103059	Have you come to a decision on Lily? I'll need to know before I can do anything else.
AID00103060	My request is perfectly reasonable. Give us the Stealth Boy specs and there will be no need for us to splatter the room with your insides.
AID00103061	Don't you still have business with Doctor Henry? You and I are done.
AID00103062	That Keene, always causing trouble.
AID00103063	Be careful with Keene. He's got a mean temper.
AID00103064	I can't believe Chomps got arrested! They said he was involving in smuggling, if you can believe it.
AID00103065	The Deathclaws have been keeping their distance. For now.
AID00103066	When do you think the NCR will send their troops to help us?
AID00103067	Jas screwed up the coffee again. Wouldn't drink it if I were you.
AID00103068	It's too damn hot.
AID00103069	<Questions about Searchlight>
AID00103070	<Questions about Edwards>
AID00103071	<Cottonwood Cove Quest>
AID00103072	Go away.
AID00103073	Who the hell are you? Better yet, what the hell are you doing in this cursed place?
AID00103074	You know what? Forget it, it doesn't matter. Welcome to Camp Searchlight, the shittiest place on earth.
AID00103075	Yeah?
AID00103076	<Questions about dog tag>
AID00103077	<Questions for Edwards>
AID00103078	<Arachnophobia Quest Stuff>
AID00103079	What now?
AID00103080	What?
AID00103081	You've been a huge help here. Thanks to you, I think we can hold this camp together.
AID00103082	Was there something else?
AID00103083	It was you that rescued President Kimball, wasn't it? You're becoming quite the celebrity already.
AID00103084	I heard it was a close call for the President. Good thing he has top-notch security.
AID00103085	I hear they're already assembling a team to investigate the President's assassination. Going to be one hell of a report.
AID00103086	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bastard that killed the President.
AID00103087	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bitch that killed the President.
AID00103088	So, the NCR finally sent some relief? It's about damn time.
AID00103089	Wow. Hey, it's you. What are you doing in Bitter Springs?
AID00103090	I don't suppose you're feeling helpful today?
AID00103091	I don't know what you're doing here, but you can just leave. We've got enough problems here.
AID00103092	Those medical supplies have already been a phenomenal help. Thank you.
AID00103093	I really appreciate those books. They've already been a huge help.
AID00103094	Yeah? What is it?
AID00103095	I warned them about that truck weeks ago. Always be prepared for any hazardous radiation I said.
AID00103096	Those headstrong fools should have listened...
AID00103097	Are you ready to head upriver?
AID00103098	Ave. Are you ready to head upriver?
AID00103099	Caesar awaits you in his tent. You have license to find your own way.
AID00103100	I'll wait here, to ferry you back to the western shore when your visit has concluded.
AID00103101	Ave. Are you ready to travel to the Fort?
AID00103102	Caesar has permitted you to leave, but not with the Platinum Chip in your possession. Relinquish it and you may go.
AID00103103	Ave. Are you ready to return to Cottonwood Cove?
AID00103104	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items. This order also extends to the Platinum Chip you carry - for now.
AID00103105	Caesar has permitted you to leave, but not with the Platinum Chip in your possession. Relinquish it and you may go.
AID00103106	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items.
AID00103107	You may proceed. Your belongings will be returned when you leave.
AID00103108	Halt! What business have you in Cottonwood Cove, outsider?
AID00103109	You're the one Lucullus said would come? You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
AID00103110	What are you doing standing around, whelp? {KAI-zar)Caesar awaits!
AID00103111	You're the one Lucullus said would come. You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
AID00103112	Scum such as you does not belong here. Leave, or be added to the dead.
AID00103113	Trade with Canyon Runner if you like. Make trouble and things won't go well for you.
AID00103114	You did well to give Centurion Aurelius the Profligates' listening machine. We'll butcher the troops they send to ambush our patrols.
AID00103115	Ave. Name your business.
AID00103116	I see you bear the Mark of Caesar! Cursor Lucullus awaits you at the docks!
AID00103117	Caesar does not like to be kept waiting. I would find Cursor Lucullus quickly and travel to The Fort, if I were you.
AID00103118	He should still be waiting at the docks.
AID00103119	Ave. Have you come to sell or trade for captures?
AID00103120	Ave. How goes it?
AID00103121	Hey man, when in Rome.
AID00103122	I look so good in this shit, I want you to call me Fucking Spectacular from now on.
AID00103123	Well look who it is! Fantastic's little helper, all grown up. Following in his master's footsteps.
AID00103124	Guess who got promoted to goddamn dam god? The cream always rises to the top, and Fantastic always rises to the top of the cream.
AID00103125	What the fuck, man? Are you loco?
AID00103126	You just killed my paycheck.
AID00103127	Who the hell are you? They bring you in to replace me? They're replacing me, aren't they?
AID00103128	Yo.
AID00103129	This is a restricted area. State your business.
AID00103130	What is it?
AID00103131	What have you done? Get away from me!
AID00103132	It's unusual to see a new face here. Are you a soldier, or a scientist?
AID00103133	Your organization will doom all of us.
AID00103134	What can I help you with?
AID00103135	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
AID00103136	We don't even need this place. But it sure scares the shit out of the NCR that we've got a base here.
AID00103137	The NCR left its soldiers here to die. Must be their strategy for the whole war.
AID00103138	It was only a matter of time before HELIOS fell to us.
AID00103139	We will not lose this place again.
AID00103140	HELIOS One is safe in our hands and our hands alone.
AID00103141	Under NCR control, this place was a gun in the hands of a child.
AID00103142	Back again. What now?
AID00103143	Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company!
AID00103144	Worker #27438 reporting! There seems to be a malfunction with the line, sir!
AID00103145	Wait a minute. You're not my manager! Intruder!
AID00103146	
AID00103147	Hello there. It's good to see a friendly face. Almost took you for a raider, I did. Name's Malcolm. Malcolm Holmes.
AID00103148	Don't suppose you'd care to trade? I'm missing a few essentials and- oh, screw this. Lying just ain't in my nature.
AID00103149	I'll tell it to you straight. I've been following you for a good bit now.
AID00103150	Eh? You want to talk some more?
AID00103151	Thank god you came around. That guy was going to kill me!
AID00103152	Sure is nice to have the lights on again.
AID00103153	With the Deathclaw pack leaders dead, I hope we can get back to work soon.
AID00103154	Snuffles' leg seems to have gotten better.
AID00103155	Man, I wish I'd stayed back in California some days.
AID00103156	Generator's still not working. Big surprise.
AID00103157	Poor Snuffles. Wish somebody could do something about his leg.
AID00103158	What is it, trooper? You're not assigned to my squad, as far as I know.
AID00103159	I'm not a recruitment officer. If you want to join the army, I'm sure someone at McCarran can point you in the right direction.
AID00103160	What is it?
AID00103161	Hey, I'm just a farmer. I don't want any trouble and I don't have anything valuable.
AID00103162	Howdy. Something I can help you with?
AID00103163	Our water ration suddenly increased. Can't help but think that you had something to do with it.
AID00103164	You showed up just in time to say goodbye. Me and couple of the others are packing it in and heading back to California.
AID00103165	The water ration's still a problem, and the NCR doesn't look like it's going to do anything about it anytime soon.
AID00103166	Something else you need before I go?
AID00103167	Howdy. Something else I can help you with?
AID00103168	Is there something I can do for you?
AID00103169	You need water? I got water, clean and fresh, straight from Lake Mead.
AID00103170	If you're low on caps, I've also got slightly irradiated wasteland water. A little fallout never killed anybody.
AID00103171	Welcome back! Are you thirsty for some fresh, clean water?
AID00103172	Welcome to the Grub n' Gulp!
AID00103173	Welcome back to the Grub n' Gulp!
AID00103174	If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
AID00103175	Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
AID00103176	The maize is doing well in this soil.
AID00103177	I'm glad the troopers are smart enough not to trample everything.
AID00103178	Something - or someone - has been chewing on the coyote tobacco again.
AID00103179	We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
AID00103180	Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
AID00103181	Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
AID00103182	<Alexus Top Level Topics>
AID00103183	I'm glad to see a fellow trooper. My squad is in trouble.
AID00103184	Need something?
AID00103185	Are you fucking kidding me?
AID00103186	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, man?
AID00103187	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
AID00103188	Are you fucking kidding me?
AID00103189	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, bitch?
AID00103190	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
AID00103191	Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
AID00103192	Wait - you're that courier. Hey. know what Boxcars needs, friend? Some fucking pain relief!
AID00103193	Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
AID00103194	Just give me some goddamn Med-X and fuck off, will ya?
AID00103195	What is it this time?
AID00103196	Well, isn't this a surprise. I was just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed each other!
AID00103197	It's fitting you got to see how I punished this town, for such is your fate. You will die for your crimes against the Legion!
AID00103198	How interesting! You're the Profligate courier who's been of some assistance to the Legion.
AID00103199	Well, well, well! If it isn't our favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
AID00103200	Well, well, well! What's our favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
AID00103201	Oh. I don't know if you recognize me from the Strip, when I handed you the Mark of Caesar? I wasn't wearing a dog's head at the time.
AID00103202	Don't worry, I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates. It's useful that you happened by.
AID00103203	I want you to witness the fate of the town of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
AID00103204	I want you to teach everyone you meet the lesson that Caesar's Legion taught here, especially any NCR troops you run across.
AID00103205	Was there more for us to discuss?
AID00103206	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, delivering a sermon, if you will.
AID00103207	When you move on, head west to the Mojave Outpost and tell the Profligate troops what you found here.
AID00103208	Hah! And we were just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed you!
AID00103209	If anyone belongs on a cross, it's you! For your crimes against the Legion, you will die!
AID00103210	How interesting! You're the Profligate courier who's been of some assistance to the Legion.
AID00103211	Well, well, well! If it isn't the Legion's favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
AID00103212	Well, well, well! What's the Legion's favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
AID00103213	Well, well, well! I've heard of you - the courier upon whom mighty Caesar has bestowed his Mark!
AID00103214	Don't worry, I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates. It's useful that you happened by.
AID00103215	I want you to witness the fate of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
AID00103216	Well, I'd like you to move west towards the Mojave Outpost, to let the Profligates there know about the little sermon I prepared for them here.
AID00103217	Was there more for us to discuss?
AID00103218	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, delivering a sermon, if you will.
AID00103219	When you move on, head west to the Mojave Outpost and tell the Profligate troops what you found here.

AID00103284	Guess Jamison won't be showing his face around here again. It's about time.
AID00103285	Tough luck for Janet, huh? I know I'd hate to lose all that pay.
AID00103286	I've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their pay. Janet is damn lucky.
AID00103287	I hope it will snow later.
AID00103288	Stupid Big Horners were making noise all night again.
AID00103289	Spotted some humans down the road. Could be Great Khans again.
AID00103290	Some days I miss being in the Master's army.
AID00103291	You think Marcus could get us some miniguns? Or missile launchers?
AID00103292	Better watch out. Lily's been babbling about her grandkids again.
AID00103293	Doctor Henry's pretty smart - for a human.
AID00103294	Ugh. Need to tighten up my vises again.
AID00103295	Damn mercs. Glad you got rid of them.
AID00103296	No more reason to stick around since Marcus is dead.
AID00103297	Thanks for helping Doctor Henry with his research.
AID00103298	A cure for the Nightkin is supposed to be on the way.
AID00103299	I heard it'll still be some time before the Nightkin are cured. Hope they stick around that long.

AID00103303	I like it up here. Nice and cool.
AID00103304	I cannot speak long, for my men need direction. What do you want?
AID00103305	The legate is expecting you.
AID00103306	It is important that you go see the legate.
AID00103307	The legate would have my head if I were to let you pass.
AID00103308	Soon, my lovelies. Soon you'll get all the meat you can handle.
AID00103309	I haven't fed them in days. The legate wants them hungry for the battle to come.
AID00103310	Some fool asked me the other day what mongrel meat tastes like. I told him I'd sooner feed him to my dogs than the other way around.
AID00103311	The enemy is weak up close, so I must learn to kill quickly at that quarter.
AID00103312	When attacking with a blade, aim for the meat of the opponent. Tendons and muscle are no good to a man when severed.
AID00103313	When attacking with a blunt weapon, aim for the opponent's bones. Hips, joints, and especially the skull are all viable targets.
AID00103314	A sharp knife can make the difference between a clean kill and a messy death.
AID00103315	It's amazing how dull a blade can get just by passing through slave meat.
AID00103316	I must have all of these blades sharpened soon. Rumor is we head out any time now.
AID00103317	Our men are stronger, faster, and have wills of iron. How can we lose?
AID00103318	I'm a little busy at the moment.
AID00103319	When will we receive the order to march? I'll go crazy if I don't kill something soon.
AID00103320	We will see that the camp is protected from NCR assassins.
AID00103321	The battle is already decided. All that's left is the bloodletting.
AID00103322	Mars be with you.
AID00103323	Salve, Courier. How goes the battle in the east?
AID00103324	My orders are to remain here, and direct our men as they arrive. Go!

AID00103330	I'm hungry!
AID00103331	I'm sleepy!
AID00103332	I'm scared!

AID00103335	What's that, Antler? We have a visitor?
AID00103336	An assassin, more like! I say kill it, Antler. For safe's sake!
AID00103337	Huh? ...Okay, Antler. I'll ask.
AID00103338	Hi, human. Why you come here?
AID00103339	Antler sings for Stealth Boys. Have you found them?

AID00103341	Greetings, Hunter of The Thorn.
AID00103342	The crowds are waiting for you, stranger. Show us your best.
AID00103343	It's time for blood, not talk. Find me after the fight.
AID00103344	Well done, stranger. Here's your share.
AID00103345	The Thorn does not welcome you, stranger. Leave now or suffer the consequences.
AID00103346	Even the strongest creatures need their rest, and their companionship. I've been looking forward to this.
AID00103347	You know where we meet, and that's not here.
AID00103348	<Placeholder Node for Questions Root>
AID00103349	You've broken the rules of The Thorn. You've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
AID00103350	I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
AID00103351	We're watching you... stranger!
AID00103352	Don't fuck with the caged beasts.
AID00103353	I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
AID00103354	Follow the rules of The Thorn.
AID00103355	Don't feed the creatures.
AID00103356	What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
AID00103357	Nowhere else will you find something like The Thorn.
AID00103358	Take advice. Don't break the rules. And we won't kill you.
AID00103359	You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
AID00103360	Come see the fights, or Red Lucy?
AID00103361	Enjoy the show, and don't give us a reason to shoot you, okay?
AID00103362	You've just fucked up, big time!
AID00103363	Lay down with me, my hunter.
AID00103364	Our time was sweet, my hunter. But our passion will have to wait - The Thorn demands attention.
AID00103365	No more fights today. The Thorn needs time to soak its tribute of blood.
AID00103366	The Legion are trouble. You should watch out.
AID00103367	The road is dangerous. You better stay sharp.
AID00103368	I'm getting out of here.
AID00103369	Fuck this place.
AID00103370	The Legion will pay for this.
AID00103371	I kinda like being a farmer.
AID00103372	I'm glad Mean Sonofabitch is on our side.
AID00103373	Crops aren't getting as much water lately.
AID00103374	We're better off with those slaver bastards Saint James and Dermot.
AID00103375	That Sweetie sure is something.
AID00103376	I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
AID00103377	Anything new happening?
AID00103378	It is time for the meeting with the bosses. We can't chit chat right now.
AID00103379	Hey, thanks for all the help back there.
AID00103380	Hey pal, thanks for helping us shape things up. You're good people.
AID00103381	Take a seat on the couch over there, Nero and me want to have a little talk with you.
AID00103382	Take a seat on the couch please, so we can have a little talking time.
AID00103383	I'm on my way to have some private time, give me some peace.
AID00103384	I'm on my way to my office, give me a little time before you get in my face.
AID00103385	I'm on my way to my room, I don't have time to chat with you right now.
AID00103386	Come to my office, we'll have a little chat with Cachino.
AID00103387	I don't have time to chat right now. If you have business, wait for me to get settled in.
AID00103388	Well, what do we have here, huh? Let me guess. You've heard about the mistress who makes all your fantasies come true.
AID00103389	So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
AID00103390	Any interest in helping us with Mr. House's data network? I'm still good for the medical supplies.
AID00103391	Have you reconsidered our offer to bug Mr. House's data network? It could be of enormous medical value to us and could alleviate a lot of suffering.
AID00103392	Oh, hi. Thanks again for helping us with that data. I mean, the feed only lasted about thirty seconds and it's not that useful, but... we tried.
AID00103393	Thanks again for helping with Mr. House's data network. Come see me at the Old Mormon Fort if you get a chance.
AID00103394	Drop dead.
AID00103395	What's up?
AID00103396	Hot damn do I love this place.
AID00103397	This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
AID00103398	I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
AID00103399	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.

AID00103412	Hey, you're Cachino's friend. You got business with me?
AID00103413	Have you found out anything to help me?
AID00103414	Man, thanks for finding out that shit, fuck Big Sal.
AID00103415	Thanks for taking care of getting me out of here. I owe you big time.
AID00103416	Who are you? I didn't do anything, leave me alone.
AID00103417	You again? Make it quick.
AID00103418	You're always welcome here, good to see you again. Let's chat, what's on your mind?
AID00103419	
AID00103420	Hey, you're the one everyone's talking about. What business you got with me?
AID00103421	What do you need? I'm a busy man.
AID00103422	Hey Buddy, Zoara is off limits to everyone but Family.
AID00103423	Go ahead and talk to the bosses, they'll want to hear what you have to say.
AID00103424	Thanks for bringing Cachino's transgressions to our attention. Shame we had to put him down, he was a good lieutenant.
AID00103425	Hey, it's my good friend again. What can I do for you?
AID00103426	Hold up, I gotta have a chat with Cachino.
AID00103427	You got something you need to talk about?
AID00103428	
AID00103429	Let's get this going.
AID00103430	Hey, I'm leaving and I don't have anything more to say to you, so get the fuck out of my face.
AID00103431	Hey, nice to meet you. Do you need help with something?
AID00103432	Hey, did you track down some chlorine for me?
AID00103433	Good to see you again, I hope you're winning some money in here.
AID00103434	Hey, what's up?
AID00103435	Okay. We can talk here.
AID00103436	Come here, baby. I'm all yours... are you ready to be all mine?
AID00103437	C'mon, people are looking at us.
AID00103438	It's now or never, let's go.
AID00103439	You truly are something else! Those Omertas looked like they were going to kill Carlitos on the spot.
AID00103440	I have nothing to give you except my thanks... and, well, if I were you I'd not mess around with the Omertas anymore, but listen to this.
AID00103441	Cachino has said things that make me think there's a big and nasty operation in the works, something about "getting even" with Mr. House.
AID00103442	Just thought you'd like to know. Okay, I'm getting Carlitos as far away from here as possible. Hope to see you again, bye!
AID00103443	I'm happy to see you again. Carlitos and I have been living here since our escape. We'll never forget what you've done for us.
AID00103444	Oh, no! No, no, no... Carlitos, dead? What, what will I do now?
AID00103445	Hey there, sugar. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? You're so handsome I might just give you a discount.
AID00103446	Hi, honey. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? Every night's ladies night here.
AID00103447	You damn idiot. I just counted those caps you gave me, and there's not enough there!
AID00103448	All those NCR troops should see me to celebrate. Come one, come all!
AID00103449	I'm not letting the Legion make me a slave. Even I have standards.
AID00103450	Guess it's true what they say - the house always wins in the end.
AID00103451	No Mr. House, no NCR, no Legion, no rules! New Vegas is going to be just one wild, never-ending party.
AID00103452	Back again? Did you miss me?
AID00103453	What the fuck do you want now?
AID00103454	
AID00103455	Well look, the bully is back. What the hell do you want?
AID00103456	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. What can I help you with today?
AID00103457	Let's meet in my room, hon. Follow me.
AID00103458	Let's meet in my room, hon. Follow me.
AID00103459	Take a seat! Play to win.
AID00103460	You look like the lucky type, come play the odds.
AID00103461	Play the tables, test your luck.
AID00103462	You gotta play big to win big.
AID00103463	Feeling lucky?
AID00103464	Sorry, can't let you play here.
AID00103465	You're cut off.
AID00103466	Try the Tops, your money is no good here.
AID00103467	Done playing? Try watching some dancers.
AID00103468	Be patient. Don't blow it, now.
AID00103469	I've enjoyed it, hon. But, if you want more of it, you know what you've got to do.
AID00103470	We got the message. We're going.
AID00103471	You didn't see nothin', got it?
AID00103472	You'll get no trouble from me.
AID00103473	Hey, I just do what I'm told.
AID00103474	Howdy, son! How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
AID00103475	If you don't mind, I have to look after my husband...
AID00103476	Howdy, young lady. How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
AID00103477	Howdy! Good seeing you again.
AID00103478	Good to see you again.
AID00103479	No time to chat now, kid. I'm outta this city for good.
AID00103480	Sorry, but I don't have time to talk right now. I'm going back to the ranch.
AID00103481	Can't dilly-dally right now, kid. Got to lay these old bones to rest for the night. Try me tomorrow.
AID00103482	Walter! My husband's... No, it can't be!
AID00103483	Not right now. I've got to make sure my husband gets enough rest. He's much too involved in this Gunderson business for his own good. Maybe tomorrow.
AID00103484	Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
AID00103485	Yeah, what do you want?
AID00103486	Hey, it's you! What's the news?
AID00103487	You've made it! Thank you so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
AID00103488	Let me guess. You want to know my secret - how I got my beard to grow in so thick.
AID00103489	Just talk to Big Beard next to me, pal. Whoever's got the biggest whiskers, does the talking...
AID00103490	Couldn't stay away, huh?
AID00103491	Well, well, well, if it isn't our whore, Joana... and, I don't believe this. Carlitos!
AID00103492	We had you and the whore clocked from the start, but we thought Carlitos would be long gone by now.
AID00103493	He should've fled with the caps he stole from the family. We Omertas don't forget and now's time to pay for your offenses.
AID00103494	Hi. I'm Frewell
AID00103495	Fretwell again, brah.
AID00103496	Frettie, a thirtie.
AID00103497	Yo, I'm Willis, trooper Willis to you, punk.
AID00103498	Me again, ahole!
AID00103499	Why not?
AID00103500	Henchman number 1, yeah.
AID00103501	Henchman number 2 bro!
AID00103502	<Grouping for Crocker top-level infos>
AID00103503	Look, we are going, okay? So, leave us be.
AID00103504	<Omerta Thug, greets player in Gomorrah>
AID00103505	I don't know how we pulled this off, for a minute there I thought we were not going to make it.
AID00103506	Without you, we'd been in the losing end. Thank you so much for your help, friend.
AID00103507	No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
AID00103508	It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
AID00103509	For my beard, I do as I promised.
AID00103510	Hey, friend! It's good to see you again.
AID00103511	This place don't have the glitter of the Strip, but I've got Joana - that's all I'll ever need.
AID00103512	We're ready. Let's get out of here.
AID00103513	Thank you for your help!
AID00103514	I'm out of here.
AID00103515	C'mon, let's go.
AID00103516	Can't thank you enough for saving us.
AID00103517	Didn't expect things to go so bad - I'm not staying here any longer.
AID00103518	Hear that up on the ridge behind me there? We got some geckos to clear out.
AID00103519	Bunch of little monsters is what they are. Seems like Doc Mitchell treats more gecko bites than anything else.
AID00103520	Let's see if we can get a little closer. If we move quietly, we can get the jump on 'em. More likely to hit something vital that way.
AID00103521	See? You're getting the hang of it.
AID00103522	There's two more wells that still need clearing. You want, you can come along. It'd be worth a few caps to me.
AID00103523	Confound it, Cheyenne, why'd you have to go running in like that? You were supposed to stay.
AID00103524	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this. I'm not not gonna be very good company right now.
AID00103525	I did have another thing to teach, but I'll understand if you'd rather I just pay you so you can be on your way.
AID00103526	Now that was some good work. Even got a little exciting there at the end.
AID00103527	Here's a little spending money for the trouble.
AID00103528	Ah, hell's bells. There's not a day passes by I don't tell people not to come here by themselves.
AID00103529	Some people, your word just isn't good enough for them. Then this happens.
AID00103530	Well, it's part of life out here. Best to accept it.
AID00103531	But you did what you promised, staying out here with me. Here's my end of the deal.
AID00103532	Hey, that's not bad! See? All it takes to make a recipe is the right ingredients and the right know-how.
AID00103533	Sometimes it won't be a campfire you need. Might need to do some work on your guns and ammo, maybe.
AID00103534	Important thing to get is it's all the same idea. You just need to find the right place to set up shop. Workbench or... a reloading bench, whatever.
AID00103535	Well, I hope that's enough to get you started.
AID00103536	Everything all right?
AID00103537	I'm heading back now. Hope I didn't miss anything good on the jukebox. Cheyenne would never forgive me.
AID00103538	It's important that you're relaxed for this next test. Please, have a seat.
AID00103539	All right. I'm gonna say a word. I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.
AID00103540	Dog.
AID00103541	Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
AID00103542	I hope you don't mind but I gave the note a look. I thought it might help me find a next of kin. But it was just something about a platinum chip.
AID00103543	Hi, what can I do for you?
AID00103544	Welcome back. Need anything?
AID00103545	I've been taking care of the shop, since Michael... I've got to look forward. Someone's got to bring beauty into this barren world.
AID00103546	Excuse me, but I'm busy.
AID00103547	What's up?
AID00103548	Hey, it's you! Michael Angelo told me about your photographs. I hope to see the world, one day, like you do.
AID00103549	Welcome back, friend. What can I do for you?
AID00103550	Greetings, citizen. Please, select your accommodation needs.
AID00103551	Behave, and don't give me a reason to kick you out.
AID00103552	This is going to be fun!
AID00103553	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.
AID00103554	I bet you'd make an awesome Boomer.
AID00103555	Yay! I love my new toy!
AID00103556	Thanks for the help. That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
AID00103557	Did you see that? That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
AID00103558	Thanks again for the help.
AID00103559	This day just can't get any worse.
AID00103560	Did you see that? That guy was going to kill me!
AID00103561	Hey, it's you ag- what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?
AID00103562	Don't worry about me. I'm a little shaken up, but I'll be okay.
AID00103563	Could you, maybe, stay away from me? You're creeping me out.
AID00103564	We spoke earlier, didn't we? About Vault 22. My offer still stands, if you've changed your mind.
AID00103565	We still need a contractor on our Vault 22 project. Interested?
AID00103566	Yes? Something else you needed?
AID00103567	I received a pleasant call from Dr. Keely. It seems we have you to thank for keeping her alive. Very charitable of you.
AID00103568	Ah! I was just wondering what had become of you.
AID00103569	What do you want? I thought I told you to stay the hell out of here.
AID00103570	What are you doing in my office? You're not welcome here, get out!
AID00103571	Did Dr. Hildern... this really isn't any of my business, but... did he give you a job?
AID00103572	Little busy at the moment. But I can talk.
AID00103573	If you can find Keely and keep her safe, I'll pay you what I can. I gave my word, and I meant it.
AID00103574	Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
AID00103575	She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy.
AID00103576	Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
AID00103577	Did you find Keely? You haven't been back for a while, so I was hoping...
AID00103578	Oh! Good to see you again.
AID00103579	Unless I hear from Keely, we've got nothing to talk about.
AID00103580	Keely still hasn't checked in. It's not like her...
AID00103581	After what happened with Keely, Hildern's got his eye on me. We shouldn't be talking... not anymore.
AID00103582	You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or...
AID00103583	Took your sweet time. I suppose the NCR sent you?
AID00103584	It's better not to do a lot of talking on assassination missions.
AID00103585	I hear you took care of Motor-Runner. I could have handled that on my own.
AID00103586	Thanks for the help back at Vault 3. I couldn't have gotten out of there without the assist.
AID00103587	Thanks for the assistance, doc. Time for us to go take out Motor-Runner?
AID00103588	What do you need? I have a job to do.
AID00103589	I'm ready to take out Motor-Runner when you are.
AID00103590	How the hell did you get in here? And who the hell are you?
AID00103591	What are you doing here, soldier? I didn't call for any support.
AID00103592	Hey! Yeah you! Come give us a hand!
AID00103593	You again. You ready to give us some help?
AID00103594	Rick is dead, but I'd still welcome my freedom!
AID00103595	Are you going to free me or what?
AID00103596	Thanks for the help.
AID00103597	Thank you for releasing us.
AID00103598	Talk to Rick if you have something you'd like to say.
AID00103599	If you have anything to say, talk to Rick.
AID00103600	Why the fuck are you back here?
AID00103601	What the fuck are you doing here?
AID00103602	Man, are you turned around. Motor-Runner is one the other side of the complex.
AID00103603	I know who you are. I'm a patient man, but you'd better have a damn good reason to be standing here right now. Spit it out.
AID00103604	Look who it is. I haven't had the privilege, but I'm told you've been an angel on our shoulder. What can we do for you at Camp McCarran?
AID00103605	Well. I'm glad we could finally meet. My sources tell me you've done some good work for us. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
AID00103606	I'm usually good with faces, but I don't think I've seen you here before. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
AID00103607	What happened?
AID00103608	Yes, what is it?
AID00103609	What are you doing here? You don't have clearance.
AID00103610	Get the hell out of my sight.
AID00103611	Hey, what are you doing out here at this hour?
AID00103612	Trouble sleeping again, huh? Well, do yourself a favor - try and get some rest.
AID00103613	Following up on your lead, huh? Good. I'll get out of your way before I blow your cover.
AID00103614	I hope you catch this guy.
AID00103615	Nice to meet you. I'm Curtis.
AID00103616	Well?
AID00103617	What is it?
AID00103618	Hey! Can't you see I'm busy here?
AID00103619	Nah, I'm just kidding. This has to be the most worthless patrol duty on the whole base. They never attack this gate.
AID00103620	They just put me back here because they don't think I can handle anything else.
AID00103621	Man, am I bored.
AID00103622	What is it, soldier?
AID00103623	You stick out like a sore thumb around here. You sure you're in the right place?
AID00103624	You weren't supposed to kill him! Goddamn it. Not only did we not get any information, but now you've ended his suffering, too.
AID00103625	Shit, guess I can forget about a promotion this decade. Thanks a lot, asshole.
AID00103626	Fuck. What am I going to tell the colonel?
AID00103627	Haven't you done enough?
AID00103628	Poor guy. He's all tuckered out. Well, I guess we'll have to pick up where we left off tomorrow. Good work.
AID00103629	I'm sure he'll have had enough after a few days of this. Or if we're lucky, a few months.
AID00103630	I'll get someone in here to clean up the mess he made. You can head out for the day. Let's let him sleep.
AID00103631	That was fun to watch. I'd have you do it again, but I'd probably get in trouble.
AID00103632	This'll do the NCR a lot of good, so you should be proud.
AID00103633	Here's the standard fee, plus I threw in the price of a good show on the Strip. That's from me personally. You can beat up my prisoners anytime.
AID00103634	You did well. I don't know how you did it without putting a scratch on him, and I'm a little disappointed personally, but it saved the NCR some face.
AID00103635	And it could save us more than that when all is said and done. I'm gonna talk to some people when we're through here.
AID00103636	This is about double the standard fee we'd give a "consultant," but from what I saw, you're more of an artist. So think of this as your commission.
AID00103637	Let's finish this up, then we can talk.
AID00103638	You're back.
AID00103639	What an ugly little worm you are. What pile of excrement did the lieutenant pluck you from, worm?
AID00103640	What?
AID00103641	You don't have to do this.
AID00103642	You hit like a bedridden old woman.
AID00103643	We don't have anything to discuss, worm.
AID00103644	Enough! This is pointless. I'm dead to the Legion either way. I'll tell you what I know.
AID00103645	But you should know that Caesar has always kept his own counsel. He never reveals anything that would make him vulnerable.
AID00103646	My knowledge will not prevent the inevitable. This camp will be ash within months. Maybe weeks.
AID00103647	Have you got it?
AID00103648	Hit me.
AID00103649	Get away from me.
AID00103650	I'll take it from here.
AID00103651	Boyd's in there with a prisoner right now. Boy, is she pissed.
AID00103652	Hassling Hector, huh? Got a thing for little kids?
AID00103653	Whatcha want, freakshow?
AID00103654	Who the fuck are you and why are you bothering me?
AID00103655	Back again? Jesus....
AID00103656	Come back to Violet, huh? What now?
AID00103657	Something on your mind?
AID00103658	Hey there, sweet thing. Want a ride on the Cook-Cook express?
AID00103659	Not now! I've got to get up to the lab and finish what I started!
AID00103660	This Vault-Tech machinery is so fragile. I had to jury-rig this elevator a few days ago and it's on the fritz again already.
AID00103661	Ah, that's got it. See you upstairs.
AID00103662	Hm, what's this? Did you do these repairs? Not bad. Not bad at all.
AID00103663	Saves me time, I guess. See you upstairs.
AID00103664	Good, you're here. Ready to begin?
AID00103665	I suppose you have questions. Hurry up and ask them.
AID00103666	Ah, good. You survived. I was beginning to think you hadn't. You'll be pleased to know that the spores should no longer be a problem.
AID00103667	Now all that's left is to ensure that none of this ever happens again. The research that led to these abominations must be erased.
AID00103668	Don't mind me. I have to wrap things up here, gather my gear, that sort of thing. I'll be leaving soon enough.
AID00103669	Greetings! I do not believe we have met before. I have the singular distinction of being designated as Bohr.
AID00103670	Calculating...
AID00103671	Hello again, my friend. I hope you've been finding the information in the datastore useful.
AID00103672	
AID00103673	Welcome to the range. Feel free to use any open lane.
AID00103674	Ah, outsider. I've heard that you were instrumental in providing Hardin with the evidence to bring against me. And here I had thought to use you.
AID00103675	Have you come to gloat, or did you actually want something?
AID00103676	Welcome, outsider, welcome! The lockdown has been officially lifted and everyone seems to be in good spirits.
AID00103677	With the surface open to us once again, Hardin's already started talk of sending a force out to attack HELIOS, but I hope to dissuade him.
AID00103678	What can I do for you?
AID00103679	Hail, Brother. May I help you?
AID00103680	Greetings, my friend. I hope I can be of some assistance to you.
AID00103681	I apologize, outsider, but I'm going to be busy for a little while making preparations for lifting the lockdown.
AID00103682	What is it now, outsider?
AID00103683	I'm afraid I don't have time to talk, outsider. I've had word that Hardin is charging me with violating protocol and must prepare a defense.
AID00103684	Back again, I see. Have you found all the components we need?
AID00103685	Have you had any luck finding the scouts? Or did you have something to discuss?
AID00103686	Found the missing patrols, or was something else on your mind?
AID00103687	How did you find us, stranger? And do tell the truth.
AID00103688	I've been informed that you bring us ill tidings, stranger. Care to elaborate?
AID00103689	When Paladin Ramos informed me that Veronica was approaching with an outsider in tow, at first I didn't know what to think.
AID00103690	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of use to me right now.
AID00103691	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though you'd remain Veronica's responsibility.
AID00103692	What do you say, outsider? Are you willing to help us?
AID00103693	What I wished to discuss with you can wait for once I get settled in the command room, outsider.
AID00103694	When you first showed up on our doorstep, I'll admit at first I didn't know what to think.
AID00103695	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of great use to me right now.
AID00103696	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though know we will be keeping an eye on you.
AID00103697	What do you say, outsider? Are you willing to help us?
AID00103698	How did you resolve the situation with the ranger?
AID00103699	Have you reconsidered, outsider? I can still use your help.
AID00103700	Yes, associate?
AID00103701	
AID00103702	
AID00103703	Hey, I heard the pistol got returned. Thanks a lot! I am never going to listen to Watkins again, believe me.
AID00103704	I really hope you can find that pistol.
AID00103705	Yes, can I help you?
AID00103706	Sorry, but I'm a little busy here. If you'll excuse me.
AID00103707	The lockdown is lifted! The patrols are going to start up again! Do you know what this means? I'll actually be able to get into a real fight!
AID00103708	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
AID00103709	Hey, so Hardin becoming Elder was because of you, huh? Good job. Now that the lockdown if lifted, I may get a chance to get into a real fight!
AID00103710	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
AID00103711	I hear you handled the NCR ranger that was camping out topside.
AID00103712	Don't get a big head or anything about it. I would have taken him out if they'd let me.
AID00103713	Yeah?
AID00103714	
AID00103715	You'll find your equipment in the chest to your right. Don't bother coming back until you've dealt with the ranger.
AID00103716	Stand back from the door. The Elder's eager to hear your report.
AID00103717	[You hear nothing.]
AID00103718	Where did you learn that password? And tell the truth, because I'll know if you're lying.
AID00103719	Listen up. I'm in charge of security around here, and I can't say I'm too happy having an outsider waltzing around.
AID00103720	But since you came in with Veronica, I'm inclined to cut you a little slack. Just behave yourself and we won't have any problems, okay?
AID00103721	Oh, and the Elder's going to want to talk to you. He's on the second level. Just take a right once you get down there.
AID00103722	My office is right here in case you need anything. Just ask for Ramos.
AID00103723	How the hell did you get in here? Normally, I would have already shot you, but I'm under orders to bring you to the Elder. Will you come peacefully?
AID00103724	Rest up, and make your report to the Elder when you're up to it.
AID00103725	If you have something to say, say it to Elder McNamara.
AID00103726	Your presence here... Let's just say it's highly irregular.
AID00103727	Outsiders aren't even allowed to know that our bunker's here, let alone come and go freely.
AID00103728	You impressed Elder McNamara, obviously. He must believe that you'll be very useful.
AID00103729	Oh, hey there. Something I can help you with?
AID00103730	
AID00103731	No time to talk now. I have to get ready to return to base with this information. I'll get a fat raise for this, if anyone actually believes me.
AID00103732	Okay, so you weren't kidding about there being a Brotherhood base here.
AID00103733	I'll need to report back to base about this. They'll think I'm playing a prank if I try to radio it in, so I'll need some face time with the brass.
AID00103734	Thanks for the heads up. I mean it. I'll be sure to mention you in my report.
AID00103735	Shhh. I thought I heard something up by the entrance.
AID00103736	Now, now. Calm down. I believe you saw something. Let's just head back to my camp and we'll figure out what it was, okay?
AID00103737	Sorry, but I've got a long hike ahead of me. You take care.
AID00103738	Powder ganger scum! Hands up or die!
AID00103739	Thought you'd sneak up on me, you filthy powder ganger?
AID00103740	Oh, it's you. Any particular reason you felt the need to bother me again?
AID00103741	
AID00103742	You must be the stranger I've been hearing about. Sorry, but I'm strictly forbidden from offering our tech to outsiders like yourself.
AID00103743	Besides, I'm a little busy right now.
AID00103744	Sorry, outsider, but I'm not allowed to sell you anything without the Elder's say so.
AID00103745	Besides, I'm a little busy right now.
AID00103746	I can't believe Hardin is Elder now. At least with the lockdown lifted I'll be able to resupply my store more often. So what are you here for?
AID00103747	Have you heard the news? Elder McNamara has lifted the lockdown! Good news for this store, let me tell you. I can't wait to start getting more goods.
AID00103748	So what are you here for?
AID00103749	The word came down from the Elder that I'm to offer you some of our lesser wares, as if I didn't have other matters on my mind.
AID00103750	Have you found it? I need to give my report to Hardin soon.
AID00103751	Hi there. Looking to spend some caps?
AID00103752	You again? Didn't I tell you I was busy?
AID00103753	
AID00103754	Listen very closely and do as I say. Your life depends on it.
AID00103755	Hand over everything you're carrying. Weapons, ammo, clothes, armor - everything. I want you stripped down to your underwear.
AID00103756	Save it for Paladin Ramos, outsider.
AID00103757	I said shut up and keep moving.
AID00103758	You're the one with that robot, I was hoping you'd bring him my way. Pretty impressive piece of hardware.
AID00103759	I can't say that I've seen anything quite like him before.
AID00103760	Hmmm? Oh, you must be the outsider everyone's buzzing about. Pleased to meet you. I'm Lorenzo, Senior Knight and general handyman around here.
AID00103761	
AID00103762	Hey, good to see you again. Have you thought any more about letting me take a look at the logs on your robot?
AID00103763	Good to see you! Alive, that is. Have you found all of the components yet?
AID00103764	Good to see you again. What can I help you with?
AID00103765	What do you want? And don't try anything funny.
AID00103766	That report must reach the Elder's hands. I have nothing further to give you.
AID00103767	Don't take another step if you value your life. For what purpose do you approach me?
AID00103768	The Elder is likely urgently awaiting that report. You should make your way to him as soon as possible.
AID00103769	Approach slowly, stranger. If you have no business with me, then go.
AID00103770	Quick now, off with you! The Elder must see that report!
AID00103771	It looks like you've managed to talk some sense into the Elder, outsider. Be assured, I'll still be keeping an eye on him.
AID00103772	Your efforts to help this chapter are not unappreciated. Now, what can I do for you?
AID00103773	Welcome, my friend. A new day has dawned for this chapter, and moving forward we will no longer cower in the dark.
AID00103774	And we have you to thank for it. You'll find that I can be generous to those who show loyalty.
AID00103775	Here, take this key. If you ever find yourself in need of repair, head to our safehouse to the northeast.
AID00103776	Now, what can I do for you?
AID00103777	Are you willing to listen to me now, outsider?
AID00103778	Have you reconsidered helping me, outsider? I do what I must to see that the chapter survives.
AID00103779	What is it, outsider? Have you discovered anything?
AID00103780	Welcome back, my friend. What can I do for you?
AID00103781	What do you want, outsider?
AID00103782	I appreciate all you've done, but I'm going to have my hands full for a little while. Come back later and we'll talk.
AID00103783	
AID00103784	
AID00103785	I heard we have you to thank for McNamara having a change of heart. Thank you. So what can I do for you?
AID00103786	There's a rumor going around that you were behind Hardin's takeover. I suppose his leadership is better than none at all. Time will tell.
AID00103787	So what brings you by today?
AID00103788	Hello, you must be the outsider everyone is talking about. I'm Linda Schuler. If you ever need medical attention, this is the place to come.
AID00103789	Hello. Can I help you with something?
AID00103790	
AID00103791	Please excuse me - I'm extricating myself at the moment...
AID00103792	Apologies, but I'm quite busy until I reach safety!
AID00103793	Well! That was quite an adventure. We taught those convicts a thing or two, didn't we?
AID00103794	Breaking myself out of a hostage situation - not to diminish your role in it, of course - but it was quite thrilling.
AID00103795	Problem is, there's still no law in Primm. What're we to do the next time ruffians menace us and hold us hostage?
AID00103796	Well! That was quite a per-dicament you rescued me from, there in the Bison Steve. A most unpleasant experience.
AID00103797	Going in alone to rescue a hostage! My brother-in-law was brave like that. Made a fine sheriff. Until the Powder Gangers killed him.
AID00103798	Problem is, there's still no law in Primm. What're we to do the next time ruffians menace us and hold us hostage?
AID00103799	Well, if it isn't the "lawbringer."
AID00103800	Hello again. I don't suppose you've decided to help Primm find its next sheriff?
AID00103801	Any luck finding a suitable candidate for our next sheriff?
AID00103802	Oh, it's you.
AID00103803	I suppose I should be thanking you for restoring the rule of law to Primm...
AID00103804	I don't plan to come back to the Bison Steve much in the years to come. If I ever get out of it.
AID00103805	I do hope this ordeal will be over soon.
AID00103806	If we were to miss a convict or two in here, who'd know the difference?
AID00103807	I'm Lieutenant Hayes of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. What's your business?
AID00103808	Yeah?
AID00103809	Primm is secure against outside threats. Be interesting to see how long the natives stay grateful.
AID00103810	I'm Sergeant McGee of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. If you want to talk about something, speak to Lieutenant Hayes.
AID00103811	What is it?
AID00103812	Move along, waster. Got a town to run here.
AID00103813	
AID00103814	
AID00103815	
AID00103816	Howdy pardner! Any luck tracking down Vance's gun?
AID00103817	Always good to see you, pardner! Anything I can help you with?
AID00103818	What are you doing here, stranger? You looking to start some trouble?
AID00103819	This better be good, stranger.
AID00103820	You'd best not try any funny business, stranger. One word from me, and Vance will plant you in the ground!
AID00103821	What the hell you want?
AID00103822	Thanks for talking Pauline out of robbing the Strip. Who knows what she'll think of next?
AID00103823	Thank god you talked me out of trying to rob the Strip. I guess we'll wait here until I come up with our next caper.
AID00103824	
AID00103825	Heard it was you brought the law back to Primm, youngster. Hat's off to you.
AID00103826	Primm had rule of law for the blink of an eye, but now we're back where we started.
AID00103827	Hey there, youngster.
AID00103828	Hello there. What brings you to Primm?
AID00103829	Welcome back. Good to see you again.
AID00103830	
AID00103831	
AID00103832	Have you found the components we discussed? The sooner we get this over with, the better.
AID00103833	Jason says that I am to cooperate with you on the final tasks necessary to launch the Great Journey.
AID00103834	Are you ready to get started? Those rockets aren't going to launch themselves.
AID00103835	It is almost time for the great Journey!
AID00103836	Not now! It is almost time for the Great Journey!
AID00103837	It is almost time for the great Journey!
AID00103838	Nice enough speech, I guess.
AID00103839	Well, it's up to you to go launch the rockets. There's a small mission control room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pressin a button.
AID00103840	It seems my work here is done, so I'll be on my way to Novac. We'll see how that works out.
AID00103841	Did you hear him? As though some fancy speech can make what they did to me less of a crime?
AID00103842	Go launch the rockets! There's a cramped little "mission control" room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pushing a button.
AID00103843	Enjoy the view. I hear the "Great Journey" is going to be shorter than they expected. Sweeter, too.
AID00103844	Did you hear him? My god, you were right all along. I'm no ghoul! They were just using me...
AID00103845	Go launch the rockets. Don't worry about me.
AID00103846	Leave me alone.
AID00103847	Did you bring the items we discussed? The sooner I send them on their way, the sooner I can head to Novac.
AID00103848	
AID00103849	Where did rest of my kin go? All alone now...
AID00103850	Antler is sad. We Nightkin go now, but there is fewer than when we came here...
AID00103851	Antler is sad, human. Nightkin go now, find Stealth Boys in other places.
AID00103852	You did good, smoothskin. Never thought I'd get out of that room.
AID00103853	Kind of busy running for my life here, smoothskin.
AID00103854	Come and get it, you big dumb -
AID00103855	Hey! You're not one of those things out there. Who the hell are you?
AID00103856	Did you find my friend?
AID00103857	What do you want now, smoothskin?
AID00103858	Who sent you? I ain't talking. They tried to get me to talk before, but I didn't say nothing. And I don't aim to now, by gum.
AID00103859	You've seen them too, haven't you? I can see it in your eyes. I knew I wasn't the only one.
AID00103860	Yeah? What do you want?
AID00103861	What's up?
AID00103862	Hi there, mister. You need something?
AID00103863	Hi there, miss. Can I help you with something?
AID00103864	Hello again. Did you need something else?
AID00103865	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
AID00103866	I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
AID00103867	Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
AID00103868	And we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you need anything else?
AID00103869	You've helped me so much, it seems wrong to ask, but can you spare any more water?
AID00103870	I'll never forget you. Thank you for your help.
AID00103871	I hate to ask but... do you have any more water?
AID00103872	You've saved my life. Thank you, stranger. I hate to ask you this, but times are hard...
AID00103873	Can you spare any more water?
AID00103874	Just leave me to die in peace.
AID00103875	Just go away. I'd like to die without you standing over me gloating.
AID00103876	Oh, thank God. Someone new! I need water! Please! Water!
AID00103877	Can you help me? I need water... purified water... please...
AID00103878	Please... do you have any water? I'm so thirsty...
AID00103879	Please! Please help me... I need water! I'm dying!
AID00103880	RL-3 regrets to inform that you are obviously unfit to command, sir!
AID00103881	RL-3 is pleased to see you, sir! Is there a mission to undertake?
AID00103882	RL-3 is ready for another tour of duty, sir!
AID00103883	RL-3 is ready for duty, sir!
AID00103884	Yes, commander?
AID00103885	By your command, sir!
AID00103886	Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
AID00103887	See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00103888	You're all set. Are we done here?
AID00103889	Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
AID00103890	Let me be blunt. Go away.
AID00103891	I don't know you, you don't know me. Let's keep it that way.
AID00103892	How about you just mind your own business, okay?
AID00103893	Do not interfere with security operations.
AID00103894	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
AID00103895	Protect and serve.
AID00103896	Protect and serve.
AID00103897	Good morning, sir.
AID00103898	What can I do for you?
AID00103899	Good morning, madame.
AID00103900	What can I do for you?
AID00103901	Good evening, sir.
AID00103902	What can I do for you?

AID00104022	Careful. Someone could trip on that.
AID00104023	Oh, sure. Lay mines around the arthritic old man who doesn't see so good. Thanks, boss.
AID00104024	Do I hear beeping, boss? I think I hear beeping.
AID00104025	Oh good. Mines.
AID00104026	<bark!>
AID00104027	I'll keep the dancing to a minimum.
AID00104028	That ought to even the odds.

AID00104030	There's a leg waiting to go.
AID00104031	Gonna be a bad day for somebody.
AID00104032	Ohh, that's very sneaky, dear! I'll be sure not to tell anyone about that mine!
AID00104033	You should pick that up before someone hurts themselves!
AID00104034	I hope I don't forget that's there.
AID00104035	Hard for me to step lightly with a bum leg.
AID00104036	Now why in tarnation would you put one of those, there.
AID00104037	Guess we best watch where we step.
AID00104038	You sure that's necessary?
AID00104039	What was the point of that?
AID00104040	What the hell? That's dangerous.
AID00104041	Um... why are you setting that there?
AID00104042	That'll show 'em!
AID00104043	Got any more of those?
AID00104044	Hey, you dropped something.
AID00104045	Isn't that a little overkill?
AID00104046	Why the fuck you puttin' that there?
AID00104047	Pick that back up or you'll be eatin' it.

AID00104052	They're here! Don't let them get the antidote! Oh. It's just you. You can't have it either.

AID00104056	What do you think you're doing?
AID00104057	Who the fuck do you think you are?
AID00104058	Point that shit somewhere else.
AID00104059	You think I don't see that?
AID00104060	Don't tempt me.
AID00104061	By Caesar, you're walking a fine line.
AID00104062	You're going to make this easy.
AID00104063	Drop that weapon, Outsider.
AID00104064	Think about too hard and you'll get burned.
AID00104065	Watch where you point that.
AID00104066	How about I aim my gun at you for a while, see how you like it?
AID00104067	I assure you, you look extremely virile. Now, would you mind pointing that somewhere else? Thanks.
AID00104068	Uh... what's up?
AID00104069	You looking for trouble?
AID00104070	If you need to shoot me, I won't complain!
AID00104071	Hello! Look what's pointed at me!
AID00104072	Don't worry about me! You can shoot if you want!
AID00104073	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law will not be tolerated.
AID00104074	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law is a serious offense.
AID00104075	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00104076	You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
AID00104077	That's not funny.
AID00104078	Quit screwing around!
AID00104079	I wouldn't.
AID00104080	I don't think so.
AID00104081	Why do we always hurt the ones we care about the most?
AID00104082	You, uhh, you want to point that someplace else, boss? I got enough holes in me.
AID00104083	Boss, why are you looking at me that way?
AID00104084	I wouldn't mind this so much if it weren't for that maniacal gleam in your eye.
AID00104085	<growl>
AID00104086	Pull that trigger, you'll wish you hadn't.
AID00104087	Don't like no one drawing a bead on me.
AID00104088	Better be rocksalt in that, or you're asking for an asskicking.
AID00104089	Don't make me take that away.
AID00104090	Are you drunk?
AID00104091	Pumpkin, don't point that at grandma, there's a dear.
AID00104092	Leo doesn't like that, dearie. You should stop.
AID00104093	How about you line that up on a tin can instead?
AID00104094	Don't even kid about that.
AID00104095	You're lookin' at a heap of trouble if you want it.
AID00104096	If you think you want trouble, then let fly.
AID00104097	Don't even joke like that.
AID00104098	Point that somewhere else!
AID00104099	That safety better be on.
AID00104100	Point that somewhere else.
AID00104101	For pete's sake...
AID00104102	No respect.
AID00104103	Stop that. I mean it!
AID00104104	Quit it. You're making me nervous.
AID00104105	Go ahead. Try me.
AID00104106	Think you're tough, huh?
AID00104107	You're not going to shoot me, are you?

AID00104110	PLAYER DESTROY OBJECT
AID00104111	Hello
AID00104112	Hello, it is great to finally meet you.
AID00104113	Hello.
AID00104114	...
AID00104115	Evening.
AID00104116	Morning.
AID00104117	Hey.
AID00104118	I got kicked outta Ultra Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking creeps.
AID00104119	Paladin.
AID00104120	Hello, outsider.
AID00104121	You're being watched, so don't get any ideas.
AID00104122	The bunker takes a little getting used to, doesn't it?
AID00104123	How may I assist you?
AID00104124	Paladin.
AID00104125	Initiate.
AID00104126	Greetings, Elder.
AID00104127	Knight.
AID00104128	Hello, sir.
AID00104129	Sir.
AID00104130	Apprentice.
AID00104131	The reports say Mr. House's robots are now using tech we've never heard of. We need to send a team up there, soon.
AID00104132	Looks like Mr. House is out of the picture. One less thing for us to deal with.
AID00104133	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
AID00104134	Our instruments show some impressive power fluctuations coming from across the river. What's going on over there?
AID00104135	There was a huge explosion east of the Colorado a little while ago. Does the NCR have any artillery that big?
AID00104136	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this  time to strike!
AID00104137	Seems the destruction of the monorail didn't slow the NCR down much. How many troops do they have?
AID00104138	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
AID00104139	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
AID00104140	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
AID00104141	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
AID00104142	Seems the NCR is making friends. We've had reports of them making overtures to some gang in Freeside.
AID00104143	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
AID00104144	I heard some special squad of Rangers is on its way to the Vegas area. I guess the NCR is finally getting serious about fighting the Legion.
AID00104145	There've been reports that the NCR is moving more and more troops into the area.
AID00104146	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once I'm almost glad we're down here.
AID00104147	Hey, good going with that hit on The Tops.
AID00104148	That prick, Benny, had it coming.
AID00104149	I always suspected Benny was a coward.
AID00104150	You must have some serious brass to fight off Benny's goons. Bravo.
AID00104151	You made a real mess of the Omertas. Looks like the place will be under new management now.
AID00104152	You must have some real pull with House to get inside the Lucky 38.
AID00104153	Have you seen the new Securitron upgrades? I pity anyone who gets testy with those bots now.
AID00104154	The Lucky 38 has been quiet. I wonder if something happened to House.
AID00104155	Have you noticed the Securitrons acting up? People are saying House might be dead.
AID00104156	Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar! That son of a bitch had it coming!
AID00104157	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
AID00104158	Good going destroying House's Securitron Army. That old boy's had too much power for too long.
AID00104159	Great, with the monorail bombed, Freeside is the only route in and out of Vegas.
AID00104160	At least the local vendors are seeing more business with these wealthy NCR shits wandering through.
AID00104161	I hear some Legionary named Silus got freed from McCarran. He's got quite the NCR kill count.
AID00104162	Why didn't you just let Kimball get killed? What did he ever do for us to warrant saving his life?
AID00104163	You must have thought you were hot shit going after Kimball like that, huh?
AID00104164	I hear you bagged kimball. Damn fine work, kid.
AID00104165	That's the mook that killed Benny!
AID00104166	Ave, true to Caesar.
AID00104167	True to Caesar.
AID00104168	True to Caesar.
AID00104169	We got ourselves a little Ranger family reunion now. Time's right for a feud.
AID00104170	Monster of the East, huh? Well I've got the Monster of the West in my holster right now. Hope I get to introduce them.
AID00104171	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
AID00104172	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
AID00104173	Wish I could've been there, defending Camp Forlorn Hope. Even if it didn't change anything.
AID00104174	Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
AID00104175	From here on out, we fight for Chief Hanlon.
AID00104176	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
AID00104177	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
AID00104178	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
AID00104179	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
AID00104180	All you need is one Ranger protecting the monorail. You don't even need to feed him that much. He'll get it done.
AID00104181	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
AID00104182	Hoover Dam... just thinking about it makes me nervous.
AID00104183	One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
AID00104184	The Ranger vets are on their way from Baja. Never seen one before. But I've heard they chew nails and spit napalm.
AID00104185	We put our trust in Hanlon and look where it got us. Makes you wonder if we can trust anyone at all.
AID00104186	Chief Hanlon's watching over us now. He won't let us lose.
AID00104187	They got to President Kimball. How long can we hold out?
AID00104188	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
AID00104189	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
AID00104190	No monorail access to the Strip? Where am I supposed to take my leave? Freeside?
AID00104191	We won't go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
AID00104192	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
AID00104193	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
AID00104194	Nelson's back in our hands. I hope we can defend it this time.
AID00104195	Is it me, or has the Brotherhood stopped engaging us? Smartest move they ever made, you ask me.
AID00104196	Smart move for the Kings to back down. They didn't know who they were messing with.
AID00104197	We signed a treaty with the Great Khans. Guess you can never have too many lowlife chem dealers on your side.
AID00104198	Sickens me that the Legion would try to harvest slaves from a refugee camp.
AID00104199	President Kimball is lucky he escaped. I don't think we could lose him right now.
AID00104200	Wish I could've been there to see Caesar die. What an asshole.
AID00104201	Hey there.
AID00104202	The bosses of the Omergas? Omer-nas? The ones that run Gomorrah? Someone killed them.
AID00104203	Outrageous what Mortimer did. The nerve of some people.
AID00104204	Oh, Mortimer. You always had the gift of gaffe.
AID00104205	Usually we punish people who come in here uninvited. But you've made such a splash, we don't have the heart.
AID00104206	Your theatrics were just priceless. I salute you.
AID00104207	The boy has seen too much!
AID00104208	Trespasser!
AID00104209	You don't belong here!
AID00104210	Leave this instant!
AID00104211	Outsiders are forbidden!
AID00104212	That business at the Tops could never happen here. We don't admit that sort of riff-raff.
AID00104213	I know Benny was murdered, but if you ask me, the real crime was that checkered jacket.
AID00104214	A little bird told me Benny might be gone for good. He must've been in some delightful scandal to have run off so suddenly.
AID00104215	Those Omertas. Always plotting, never relevant. Bravo for putting them in their place like that.
AID00104216	Word has it you were spotted entering the Lucky 38. How ever did you get on that guest list?
AID00104217	Is it me or do the Securitrons seem... sassier?
AID00104218	Whatever has become of Mr. House? He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
AID00104219	There's a rumor going around that you killed Caesar! I'm dying to know... is it true? That he used a hairpiece, I mean?
AID00104220	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
AID00104221	The Kings will be missed. Not by me, of course. But who will buy the food at the Tops now that no one needs it to grease their hair?
AID00104222	It sounds like the Kings made nice with the NCR in Freeside. Seems there was room for two flies on the same bit of dung after all.
AID00104223	Life at the top is immensely satisfying.
AID00104224	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
AID00104225	It must be horrible to live in places without luxury.
AID00104226	That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
AID00104227	Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
AID00104228	Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
AID00104229	I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
AID00104230	Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
AID00104231	I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
AID00104232	We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
AID00104233	It's too bad the NCR boss got out alive.
AID00104234	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
AID00104235	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
AID00104236	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
AID00104237	Wonder if we can move into the Sewers under the Strip now that Mr. House is outta business.
AID00104238	The wind's changing. I can see trouble ahead.
AID00104239	If there's war in the end, it won't affect our city.
AID00104240	Rumors of imminent war have made it all the way down here.
AID00104241	Going to stay down here until all the trouble outside blows over.
AID00104242	Looks like the entire region's going straight where we are - knee-deep in shit.
AID00104243	Only one bad thing about the Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
AID00104244	Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
AID00104245	One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
AID00104246	All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
AID00104247	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
AID00104248	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
AID00104249	Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
AID00104250	We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
AID00104251	The Hostetlers have gone through quite some trouble, lately.
AID00104252	Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
AID00104253	Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
AID00104254	I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
AID00104255	New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
AID00104256	NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
AID00104257	NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
AID00104258	Stay underground at night.
AID00104259	Watch out where you exit. Sewers can lead you to Fiend territory.
AID00104260	Keep an eye on your stuff. Damn thieves.
AID00104261	Don't go too far, it's all shadows and dangers in the lower levels.
AID00104262	Careful with those Fiends in the western sewers.
AID00104263	I need my fix.
AID00104264	I hurt all over.
AID00104265	Going to eat the next fucking rat I see.
AID00104266	Just got to find me some sweet Jet.
AID00104267	Won't ever make enough to live outside.
AID00104268	Can't go anywhere else.
AID00104269	Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
AID00104270	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
AID00104271	Good day.
AID00104272	Hey yeah. Hi.
AID00104273	Was that a guy or a gal? Aw hell, I need to stop drinking.
AID00104274	Ugh?
AID00104275	What the hell? I didn't eat any corn this week.
AID00104276	Ya got any grog?!
AID00104277	Ya got any change, man? I've got two kids to feed.
AID00104278	Ya got any change, man? I've got three kids to feed.
AID00104279	Ya got any change, man? I've got seven kids to feed.
AID00104280	Woooooo!
AID00104281	You seen Gourd around?
AID00104282	Oh, I don't think last night's rat is agreeing with me.
AID00104283	Hey lady! I know you've got some hooch somewhere in there!
AID00104284	Hey! Nice hat, nancy boy!
AID00104285	Oh, my head is killing me. I need another drink.
AID00104286	<Whistling>
AID00104287	I swear Dixon's hooch is killing me.
AID00104288	Dixon's hooch may be cheap, but it tastes like it was filtered through a dirty sock.
AID00104289	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
AID00104290	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
AID00104291	I wouldn't mind hitting that, does she put out?
AID00104292	My buddy saw some sort of elite ranger squad the other day. They took out his group from a quarter mile off.
AID00104293	I hear someone killed Motor-Runner.
AID00104294	More tough Securitrons? Shit, now we really got to stay the fuck outta the Strip.
AID00104295	I need to get some more chems.
AID00104296	I'm getting the shakes. I need something to take the edge off.
AID00104297	Damn, I think I got some bad shit.
AID00104298	Get the fuck out of my face.
AID00104299	What the fuck are you looking at?
AID00104300	Goddamn, I need a fix.
AID00104301	Hey, got any Jet?
AID00104302	Kimball had it coming. Maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
AID00104303	That NCR president somehow managed to survive a Legion hit.
AID00104304	Motor Runner is dead? Who the fuck is going to be running the show now?
AID00104305	Are the Khans going to keep selling us shit, if they join the Legion?
AID00104306	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
AID00104307	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
AID00104308	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
AID00104309	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
AID00104310	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
AID00104311	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
AID00104312	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
AID00104313	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AID00104314	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AID00104315	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AID00104316	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
AID00104317	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
AID00104318	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
AID00104319	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
AID00104320	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
AID00104321	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
AID00104322	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
AID00104323	Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
AID00104324	Oh, wearing this is not going to be good to me.
AID00104325	How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
AID00104326	Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
AID00104327	You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
AID00104328	Yes?
AID00104329	Hello.
AID00104330	I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
AID00104331	House's dead, this time for good!
AID00104332	Watch your step, sister.
AID00104333	If you can't keep that thing under control, I will.
AID00104334	Lookin' sharp, Ramos.
AID00104335	Hey, Ramos.
AID00104336	Heya Torres.
AID00104337	How's the ol' cage treating you, Torres?
AID00104338	Still breakin' hearts there, I see, Scribe Schuler.
AID00104339	How are you, Scribe Schuler?
AID00104340	I can hardly notice that lazy eye anymore, Watkins.
AID00104341	Watkins.
AID00104342	Don't work too hard there, Ibsen.
AID00104343	You look tired, Ibsen.
AID00104344	Scribe Taggart! It's your favorite student.
AID00104345	Hey Scribe Taggart! Did you get some sun?
AID00104346	Hardin.
AID00104347	Hey! How ya been?
AID00104348	Long time, no see!
AID00104349	Hey!
AID00104350	This chainlink fence perimeter is worthless. We might as well be defending a cage from the inside.
AID00104351	This place is off-limits to civilians. You don't like it, take it up with Lieutenant Haggerty.
AID00104352	Pretty sure H.Q. has forgotten all about us.
AID00104353	Who knows which side the Legion's gonna hit us from next?
AID00104354	If the Legion breaks through our defenses, I got one bullet I'm saving just for me.
AID00104355	We should be up on the front lines, not out here in bumblefuck. This place is a junkyard.
AID00104356	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
AID00104357	Maybe that guy Fantastic wasn't an idiot. Maybe he was a genius.
AID00104358	Damn that was some light show out there.
AID00104359	That was blinding out there. Feels like I've been staring at the sun.
AID00104360	Is the plant actually working again?
AID00104361	The attacks have stopped. Winning the dam saved our asses.
AID00104362	We lost Forlorn Hope. The eastern front is collapsing. They'll be here next.
AID00104363	Heard the Brotherhood got smoked. Guess somebody finished what we started.
AID00104364	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
AID00104365	Let's get going!
AID00104366	How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
AID00104367	You need to get to the Legate!
AID00104368	Don't shoot!
AID00104369	Please don't kill me!
AID00104370	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
AID00104371	Make my day, mutant.
AID00104372	I can take care of that robot problem for you. Just saying.
AID00104373	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
AID00104374	Once a republican, always a republican.
AID00104375	You aren't stealing our medicine, are you, doc?
AID00104376	You should get out of my face before you get yourself hurt.
AID00104377	I don't know how you survived the bombardment. That's incredible.
AID00104378	I'm happy you came along. You are the answer to our dreams.
AID00104379	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
AID00104380	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
AID00104381	I hear you're going to help us, I hope you're up for the task.
AID00104382	I'm happy that we managed to raise the bomber in my lifetime.
AID00104383	Thank you so much for your help.
AID00104384	I didn't think the day would ever come, but thanks to you our dreams have come true!
AID00104385	I'm amazed that an outsider has proven so helpful.
AID00104386	You've given us the ability to touch the sky! Thank you.
AID00104387	You've done us a great service. Thank you.
AID00104388	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
AID00104389	Beats being on patrol.
AID00104390	Just lost a month's caps...
AID00104391	Fucking Crocker couldn't find his ass if it wasn't on his backside...
AID00104392	Don't be carrying any guns into the casino.
AID00104393	Love how this place comes alive at night.
AID00104394	You should see this place at night.
AID00104395	Looking to lose a few caps, huh? Just the place.
AID00104396	The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
AID00104397	I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
AID00104398	It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
AID00104399	NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
AID00104400	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
AID00104401	I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
AID00104402	My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
AID00104403	Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
AID00104404	 I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
AID00104405	My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
AID00104406	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
AID00104407	Some President Kimball was. Chalk up another death to NCR incompetence.
AID00104408	Good riddance. With Chief Hanlon dead, that's one less officer to lead the NCR troops.
AID00104409	Too bad Hanlon is dead. It turns out he was trying to get the NCR out of the Mojave.
AID00104410	The Fiends have been less organized with Motor Runner gone. Good riddance.
AID00104411	Shouldn't be long before the Fiends are wiped out, now that their bosses are gone.
AID00104412	Did you hear? The Legion attacked Bitter Springs!
AID00104413	Did you hear the Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I wonder how that happened.
AID00104414	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
AID00104415	The Great Khans moved out. One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
AID00104416	Crazy Khan bastards. What were they thinking attacking the dam like that?
AID00104417	With the Kings gone, Freeside is going to be a real mess.
AID00104418	The Kings are working with NCR? What's this place coming to?
AID00104419	People are talking, buddy. You've made quite an impression on The Strip.
AID00104420	The Rangers are getting reinforcements? I hope they don't decide to bring the battle to Freeside.
AID00104421	Things look to be building up on either side of the dam. This doesn't look good.
AID00104422	The legion is bad enough. The last thing we needed around here is even tougher NCR Ranger thugs coming along.
AID00104423	It looks like the Legion and NCR are getting ready for a fight. I hope that doesn't end badly for us.
AID00104424	I hope the NCR have the manpower to defend the dam. It looks like the Legion are going to attack soon.
AID00104425	Without you, we'd all be slaves. Thanks for helping the NCR at the dam.
AID00104426	As if House didn't have enough control already. At least we don't have to deal with NCR or the Legion, now.
AID00104427	Hello there.
AID00104428	How's it going?
AID00104429	Howdy.
AID00104430	Hey.
AID00104431	Good day.
AID00104432	Yep.
AID00104433	Howdy, Arcade.
AID00104434	Another NCR grunt.
AID00104435	Good to see another strong-willed woman around.
AID00104436	That is one odd robot.
AID00104437	A Super mutant in Freeside?
AID00104438	That has to be the oldest Ghoul I've ever seen.
AID00104439	What's up Rex?
AID00104440	What's your problem, lady?
AID00104441	Business is good. All the Families got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
AID00104442	I'm glad they don't let just any motherfucker through the gate. Freeside smells like shit.
AID00104443	Fiends are bad for business. NCR should do their fucking job.
AID00104444	There's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion. They better not fuck with our power.
AID00104445	Fuck Not-At-Home, must be cozy up there in the Lucky 38.
AID00104446	Bosses don't like no trouble in their place.
AID00104447	Gomorrah is always open for Business.
AID00104448	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
AID00104449	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
AID00104450	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
AID00104451	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AID00104452	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AID00104453	What the fuck is that thing?
AID00104454	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
AID00104455	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
AID00104456	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
AID00104457	Kings sold out to the NCR huh? Might be worth a sit down with them.
AID00104458	Word on the street is something big is about to go down at Hoover Dam.
AID00104459	I hear you been making some waves around here.
AID00104460	I hear the Legion is moving some new tough muscle into the area. NCR better keep their heads down.
AID00104461	Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
AID00104462	Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
AID00104463	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
AID00104464	You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
AID00104465	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
AID00104466	I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
AID00104467	The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
AID00104468	Glad that fucker House is gone.
AID00104469	Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
AID00104470	House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
AID00104471	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
AID00104472	Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
AID00104473	Nice work at the Tops buddy.
AID00104474	What the fuck are you looking at?
AID00104475	Be sure to check out the courtyard, some of the hottest asses in New Vegas shaking out there.
AID00104476	You know you want a piece of this, give me some sugar.
AID00104477	I don't think that's what they mean by doggy style.
AID00104478	Mmm, I haven't had a ghoul before. Do I get to keep the tip?
AID00104479	Ooo, the big one looks like fun. Let me know if you want a good time.
AID00104480	Hey sexy lady, looking for a good time?
AID00104481	Hey big guy, looking for a good time?
AID00104482	The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
AID00104483	If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
AID00104484	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
AID00104485	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
AID00104486	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
AID00104487	I've heard that Securitrons are nastier than ever.
AID00104488	Sounds like Mr. House is in some kind of trouble.
AID00104489	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
AID00104490	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
AID00104491	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
AID00104492	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
AID00104493	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
AID00104494	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
AID00104495	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
AID00104496	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
AID00104497	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
AID00104498	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
AID00104499	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
AID00104500	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
AID00104501	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
AID00104502	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
AID00104503	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
AID00104504	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
AID00104505	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
AID00104506	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
AID00104507	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
AID00104508	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
AID00104509	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
AID00104510	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
AID00104511	The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
AID00104512	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
AID00104513	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
AID00104514	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
AID00104515	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
AID00104516	Khans are history, it serves them right!
AID00104517	Khans are history, it serves them right!
AID00104518	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
AID00104519	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
AID00104520	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
AID00104521	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
AID00104522	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
AID00104523	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
AID00104524	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
AID00104525	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
AID00104526	I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
AID00104527	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
AID00104528	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
AID00104529	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
AID00104530	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
AID00104531	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
AID00104532	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
AID00104533	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
AID00104534	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
AID00104535	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
AID00104536	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
AID00104537	Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
AID00104538	Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
AID00104539	I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
AID00104540	I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
AID00104541	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
AID00104542	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
AID00104543	Did you know The Strip's all stirred up, lately?
AID00104544	Things are getting stranger every day.
AID00104545	Things are getting stranger every day.
AID00104546	It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
AID00104547	It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
AID00104548	This is it. War's almost upon us.
AID00104549	This is it. War's almost upon us.
AID00104550	Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
AID00104551	Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
AID00104552	Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
AID00104553	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny
AID00104554	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
AID00104555	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
AID00104556	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
AID00104557	The bosses are having a meeting. You'll have to wait until it's over.
AID00104558	Be patient. The guns'll still be here in a few minutes.
AID00104559	Keep moving.
AID00104560	You got a problem?
AID00104561	We're watching you. Closely.
AID00104562	What's up?
AID00104563	<growl>
AID00104564	<bark!>
AID00104565	Hey.
AID00104566	I've got my eye on you.
AID00104567	Well hello, pretty lady.
AID00104568	What the devil?
AID00104569	Good day.
AID00104570	How do you do?
AID00104571	Greetings.
AID00104572	Salutations.
AID00104573	How do you fare?
AID00104574	Hello, there.
AID00104575	Do little angels want butterscotch candies? Sweets for sweeties!
AID00104576	Aww, aren't you just precious? Come here little darling, let grandma pinch your cheek!
AID00104577	Look at this little dear! Grandma Lily could just eat you up!
AID00104578	Peek-a-boo! I see you!
AID00104579	Come here little one, give Grandma Lily some sugar!
AID00104580	Have you got a hug for me, cutie-pie?
AID00104581	Grandma Lily's got hugs and kisses for all good little children! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
AID00104582	Who wants some of Grandma Lily's famous Chocolate Double Surprise?
AID00104583	Stay away!
AID00104584	Kill me!
AID00104585	What the hell is your problem?
AID00104586	Have a seat, baby - let's get this kicking.
AID00104587	Sit down, hey? Don't keep me waiting.
AID00104588	Baby, you can savor the swank digs all you want when we're done talking. Sit down.
AID00104589	Don't just stand there looking stupid.
AID00104590	Got something to say?
AID00104591	Don't just stare in dumb admiration.
AID00104592	Mind where you point those dimmers.
AID00104593	Hey.
AID00104594	Welcome. Come on in!
AID00104595	Hey, you came back! Must be doing something right.

AID00104620	You're always welcome in this town!
AID00104621	Try to control your behavior today.
AID00104622	I'm hoping this is one of your good days.
AID00104623	Vegas doesn't need your trouble.
AID00104624	Who knows what you're going to do next?
AID00104625	I bet you're up to something.
AID00104626	I don't like the look of you. Never have.
AID00104627	Don't think we aren't watching you.
AID00104628	You've got a reputation in this town, and it isn't a good one.
AID00104629	Don't bother to watch yourself. We're watching for you.
AID00104630	Come on, tough guy/gal - give me a reason.
AID00104631	Take your best shot. Then we'll take ours.
AID00104632	You're bad for Vegas. You don't belong here.

AID00104638	Hey there, "Cannibal." Heard you become a hunter - good for you.
AID00104639	Looks like you're going to get another to chance to fly, Whitman. Hope you haven't lost your touch.
AID00104640	You look like shit, Johnson. Damn, you got old.
AID00104641	Together again, eh, Captain?
AID00104642	It's nice to see us all here - even you, Moreno.
AID00104643	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
AID00104644	You got something you want to say?
AID00104645	Yeah?
AID00104646	May I help you?
AID00104647	Hey, what's up?
AID00104648	Hey, pal.
AID00104649	Hey, doll.
AID00104650	Look who it is. Freeside's favorite son.
AID00104651	Look who it is. Freeside's leading lady.
AID00104652	Hey, it's good to see you.
AID00104653	Hey there. You're the King's friend, right?
AID00104654	You here to start trouble?
AID00104655	You in the right neighborhood?
AID00104656	I'd keep moving, if I were you.
AID00104657	You know, I was just talking about trash, and here you are.
AID00104658	Don't think the shit you've pulled has been forgotten.
AID00104659	You want some of this?
AID00104660	Just give us an excuse. Been too long since I fired my weapon.
AID00104661	Don't go fucking about, asshole.
AID00104662	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
AID00104663	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
AID00104664	Not much happens here at the Dorado, and that's how we like it.
AID00104665	Only combat I seen lately was shooting some Geckos.
AID00104666	All the juice from Hoover flows right through the Dorado, and we send it west to keep the home lights burning.
AID00104667	We keep an eye out for Legion raiding parties. They'd love to shut down the Dorado.
AID00104668	My folks back home got lights at night thanks to what we're doing here.
AID00104669	Just stay out of the control room and enclosure.
AID00104670	The power transmission cables are all underground. Good thing, or the old war might've knocked them down.
AID00104671	You visiting every NCR post just to see the sights? This here's the Dorado - it's where we send power back home.
AID00104672	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
AID00104673	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
AID00104674	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
AID00104675	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
AID00104676	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
AID00104677	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
AID00104678	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
AID00104679	That tower on the Strip popped open like a can and let somebody walk right in. Mark my words - some evil's afoot.
AID00104680	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
AID00104681	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
AID00104682	Those robots on the Strip, Securi-troids or what have you? Well, they been acting different or something.
AID00104683	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
AID00104684	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots.But lately some of them been two-faced.
AID00104685	A customer who been to the Strip told me the faces on the robots there changed from police to soldiers. Now why would that be?
AID00104686	That tower on the Strip popped open like a can and let somebody walk right in. Mark my words - some evil's afoot.
AID00104687	That Mr. House who lorded over the Strip is dead. Good riddance, I say.
AID00104688	Now that Mr. House's gone, might be opportunities on the Strip for an enterprising merchant.
AID00104689	I bet that Mr. House had a buncha booze in his place. Someone oughta get it out of there. He ain't using it!
AID00104690	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
AID00104691	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
AID00104692	You hear Caesar's dead? Good for trade if the Legion goes away, that's for sure.
AID00104693	I heard Caesar didn't let nobody drink or drug. Probably why he got killed.
AID00104694	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
AID00104695	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
AID00104696	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
AID00104697	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
AID00104698	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
AID00104699	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
AID00104700	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
AID00104701	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
AID00104702	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
AID00104703	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
AID00104704	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
AID00104705	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AID00104706	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AID00104707	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
AID00104708	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
AID00104709	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? Didn't know there was anything left there to attack.

AID00104713	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
AID00104714	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
AID00104715	With fewer of them Fiends sucking up the chems, maybe I can finally score a hit now and then.
AID00104716	With those Fiends on the run, I should head over to Vault 3 and see if I can pull some salvage out of there.
AID00104717	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
AID00104718	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
AID00104719	Have you seen that tower on the Strip all lit up? You can see it for miles!
AID00104720	Have you seen that tower on the Strip all lit up? You can see it for miles!
AID00104721	I hear the Great Khans just packed up and left Red Rock Canyon. Always thought the NCR and them would fight it out again.

AID00104730	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
AID00104731	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
AID00104732	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
AID00104733	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
AID00104734	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
AID00104735	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
AID00104736	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
AID00104737	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
AID00104738	Some Khans got corned in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
AID00104739	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
AID00104740	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.
AID00104741	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.
AID00104742	Primm wimped out and accepted NCR rule. Some people will do anything to feel safe.

AID00104755	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.
AID00104756	Nobody knows who's gonna win, Legion or NCR. Might not make much of a difference around here.
AID00104757	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.
AID00104758	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.

AID00104769	Oh, excuse me.
AID00104770	Afternoon, friend.
AID00104771	Good day, sir.
AID00104772	Good day, sir.
AID00104773	Excuse me, coming through!
AID00104774	Get out of the way, chump!
AID00104775	Move, lard ass!
AID00104776	Scoot your boots, ya bum!
AID00104777	Keeping the Strip secure has been hell since the monorail was taken out.
AID00104778	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
AID00104779	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
AID00104780	How could we lose Kimball at a time like this?
AID00104781	Chief Hanlon was a model soldier. We all looked up to him.
AID00104782	Too bad about Chief Hanlon. He did what he thought was best for us.
AID00104783	Without Camp Forlorn Hope, it's a matter of time before the Legion surrounds us at the Dam.
AID00104784	This whole war's gonna change when the Ranger veterans get here. Soon as we see the Black Armor, we can all breathe easier.
AID00104785	A platoon of veteran Rangers is like a tactical nuke, only tougher to scare.
AID00104786	This battle... everything's riding on it.
AID00104787	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
AID00104788	The security lapse with the monorail is a huge embarrassment.
AID00104789	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
AID00104790	There's something fishy about how Chief Hanlon died. It just doesn't add up.
AID00104791	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
AID00104792	No hope of securing the border now that Forlorn Hope fell.
AID00104793	The Ranger veterans have been running ops in Baja. We'll be a different army with them here.
AID00104794	We've got our best Rangers here now. All of a sudden I like our chances a whole lot better.
AID00104795	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
AID00104796	Something I can do for you?
AID00104797	What is it?
AID00104798	You got something to say or do you always look like that?
AID00104799	Boyd's in there with a prisoner right now. Boy, is she pissed.
AID00104800	Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
AID00104801	Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.

AID00104816	I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.

AID00104818	They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
AID00104819	As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.

AID00104885	The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!

AID00104913	Can't wait to get the hell out of here.
AID00104914	This place stinks!
AID00104915	This sucks.
AID00104916	Might as well do the job right.
AID00104917	Hope those Fiends give us no trouble.
AID00104918	Let's just stay sharp.
AID00104919	This sucks.

AID00104922	Going to the Wrangler tonight?
AID00104923	Hey man, what are you up to?
AID00104924	Heard there was some excitement in one of the casinos in the Strip. Bunch of people got hurt when some nut started attacking people.
AID00104925	Some nut attempted to kill the head of one of Mr. House's Families recently. Whoever did it is either crazy or has balls the size of Freeside.
AID00104926	Did you hear someone managed to fight their way through the Chairmen and flee the Strip after being caught? Wonder if they're hiding out in Freeside.
AID00104927	Looks like Gomorrah's under new management. I wonder what happened?
AID00104928	There's talk of someone going into the Lucky 38 to talk to Mr. House. That's bullshit. Everyone knows Mr. House doesn't talk to anyone.
AID00104929	Man, I thought these tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
AID00104930	Is it true? Is Mr. House gone?
AID00104931	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
AID00104932	There was some some kind of explosion to the east a little while ago. Has the fighting started?
AID00104933	Did you hear? Someone bombed the monorail down at McCarran, so everyone's been forced to come through here to get to the Strip. Business is booming.
AID00104934	Seems like they've got things straightened out in McCarran now, but we're still seeing a big increase in traffic here.
AID00104935	I can't believe someone stopped the NCR president from getting killed. If anyone deserves it, it's that jerk.
AID00104936	Someone took a shot at the NCR president, but the lucky bastard got away. Oh well, it was a good try.
AID00104937	Hey, did you hear the NCR president got whacked? Good for whoever did it, I say. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
AID00104938	There's mutterings from the NCR people around here that some local hero of theirs died. Whatever.
AID00104939	Turns out some military hero the Squatters admired was actually a slimeball. An NCR soldier who's actually a dick? Who would've thought?
AID00104940	Heh, word is the leader of the Fiends got taken down. I would have done it myself, it he ever had the courage to step into Freeside.
AID00104941	I heard that some of the bosses of the Fiends were killed. Wouldn't be surprised if the NCR had something to do with it.
AID00104942	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? If we're lucky, the NCR will pull some of their soldiers away from here and send them that way.
AID00104943	Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
AID00104944	The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
AID00104945	Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
AID00104946	I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
AID00104947	If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
AID00104948	I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
AID00104949	So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
AID00104950	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
AID00104951	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
AID00104952	The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
AID00104953	I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
AID00104954	Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
AID00104955	Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
AID00104956	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
AID00104957	If it isn't Rex! Haven't seen you in a while, boy.
AID00104958	Hey Rexie, who's a good dog?
AID00104959	I owe you Follower people a beer for patching me up a while back.
AID00104960	What are you looking at?
AID00104961	Great, another fuckin' robot.
AID00104962	Hello, cutie.
AID00104963	What's a pretty girl like you doing with someone like this?
AID00104964	You need a boyfriend, honey?
AID00104965	
AID00104966	You want to have some fun with a real man, baby?
AID00104967	Want a massage, cutie? No charge.
AID00104968	Buy you a drink, honey?
AID00104969	Um, er, excuse me. I'll just get out of your way.
AID00104970	Hey baby. Wanna get wild tonight?
AID00104971	Wanna come back to my place? I've got my own mattress and everything.
AID00104972	What's the rush, baby? Stay awhile.
AID00104973	Why not try following me around for a while, darling? I'll take you someplace nice.
AID00104974	You're not from around here, right?
AID00104975	You're going the wrong way, beautiful. My place is the other way.
AID00104976	Hey, baby. I know a quiet place we can be alone. Or a loud place if you're one of those.
AID00104977	Hey.
AID00104978	What's up?
AID00104979	Hi.
AID00104980	What the hell do you want?
AID00104981	What the hell are you doing here?
AID00104982	You again?
AID00104983	Hey doc.
AID00104984	Hey doc.
AID00104985	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
AID00104986	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
AID00104987	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
AID00104988	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
AID00104989	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
AID00104990	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
AID00104991	It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
AID00104992	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
AID00104993	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
AID00104994	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
AID00104995	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
AID00104996	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
AID00104997	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
AID00104998	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
AID00104999	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
AID00105000	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
AID00105001	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
AID00105002	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
AID00105003	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
AID00105004	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
AID00105005	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
AID00105006	Those punks at Gomorrah got what they deserved.
AID00105007	Come on... time to get lucky.
AID00105008	Come on... time to get lucky.
AID00105009	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
AID00105010	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
AID00105011	Almost outta caps...
AID00105012	Almost outta caps...
AID00105013	Damn slots are robbery.
AID00105014	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
AID00105015	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
AID00105016	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
AID00105017	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
AID00105018	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
AID00105019	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
AID00105020	You turned around?
AID00105021	You turned around?
AID00105022	Watch your caps - they go quick.
AID00105023	Watch your caps - they go quick.
AID00105024	Seeing the sights?
AID00105025	Seeing the sights?
AID00105026	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
AID00105027	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
AID00105028	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
AID00105029	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
AID00105030	At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
AID00105031	Help you?
AID00105032	What is it?
AID00105033	Monorail transit is safe transit.
AID00105034	Report any suspicious activity near the Monorail.
AID00105035	No loitering.
AID00105036	Please enjoy the casinos.
AID00105037	Please do not stand in the fountains.
AID00105038	No violence is permitted on the Strip.
AID00105039	Obedience is virtuous.
AID00105040	Please obey all weapon laws.
AID00105041	Continuing patrol.
AID00105042	Strip secure.
AID00105043	I still can't believe we came to terms with the NCR.
AID00105044	I'm not going to take anything from you. Leave me alone!
AID00105045	Hey! You tried to get me sick!
AID00105046	You should learn to give kids nice things... Like toys!
AID00105047	You're the one that tried to give me that yucky stuff.
AID00105048	I don't think I should talk to you. You aren't very nice.
AID00105049	You need to leave me alone. I don't like you anymore.
AID00105050	I like you, we should play sometime!
AID00105051	Thanks for the toy! It was great!
AID00105052	Yay! I love my new toy!
AID00105053	I'm going to play raise the B-29!
AID00105054	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.

AID00105070	Now is not a good time.
AID00105071	I'm a busy man.
AID00105072	You look like you could use some medical attention.
AID00105073	Damn addicts.
AID00105074	You look like you're suffering from some radiation sickness.
AID00105075	Howdy.

AID00105112	Hope Swank's smarter than Benny.
AID00105113	Wonder where Benny got off to?
AID00105114	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a rat all along.
AID00105115	You dig this crazy scene or what?
AID00105116	Gomorrah has the loosest slots on the Strip.
AID00105117	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
AID00105118	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.

AID00105255	Alright, come back any time.
AID00105256	Goodbye, Rocketeer, be sure to visit again! Oh, and please - for your own safety, stay outside of restricted areas.
AID00105257	Here, you'll want this. It's the password to one of the terminals outside. Found it written on one of the stalls in the bathroom.
AID00105258	Farewell.
AID00105259	Farewell, brother.
AID00105260	Farewell, sister.
AID00105261	Complete your mission, then return to me.

AID00105271	Yeah.
AID00105272	Take it easy now.
AID00105273	You take care, now.
AID00105274	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse. Critters move in there sometimes.
AID00105275	Yup.
AID00105276	Yeah.
AID00105277	I'll be waiting.
AID00105278	Until next time.
AID00105279	<whimper>
AID00105280	<bark!>
AID00105281	Goodbye.

AID00105283	<Log Off>
AID00105284	Watch your back out there.
AID00105285	Nope, not going to be that easy.
AID00105286	Thank you, and enjoy your stay at The Tops.
AID00105287	A pleasure doing business.
AID00105288	Enjoy your stay at the Atomic Wrangler.
AID00105289	Have a good time and good luck.
AID00105290	Play safe.
AID00105291	Yes, yes.
AID00105292	Be seeing you. Maybe.
AID00105293	Uh-huh.
AID00105294	Hmmph.
AID00105295	Watch your six out there.
AID00105296	You know you'll be back.
AID00105297	See you.
AID00105298	You know where to find me.
AID00105299	Take care.
AID00105300	Yeah, beat it.
AID00105301	Fuck off.
AID00105302	Dismissed.
AID00105303	Catch you later.
AID00105304	Bye.
AID00105305	Later.
AID00105306	Be seeing you around.
AID00105307	Okay.
AID00105308	Go.
AID00105309	Vale.
AID00105310	Vale.

AID00106097	That doesn't belong to you!
AID00106098	If you want it, take it!
AID00106099	If you see something you like, it's yours!
AID00106100	Larceny is a serious offense.
AID00106101	That does not belong to you.

AID00106119	
AID00106120	I don't think so.
AID00106121	I don't know who you think you're fooling.
AID00106122	Hey! I need that for stuff!
AID00106123	Come on. At least steal from a mean person.
AID00106124	<Sigh>Boss, if you just ask, I'll hand it to you. Probably.
AID00106125	Boss, why do my pants suddenly feel lighter?
AID00106126	Look, boss, I appreciate you not making me carry that, but come on.
AID00106127	Think I didn't see that?
AID00106128	Good way to lose a hand.
AID00106129	Sweetie, if you want something, just ask grandma politely.
AID00106130	Stealing isn't very nice, is it Leo?
AID00106131	Is someone looking for a paddling?
AID00106132	You should give that back.
AID00106133	That don't belong to you.

AID00106144	That's mine!
AID00106145	Caught you red handed!
AID00106146	I saw that!
AID00106147	Hands off!
AID00106148	That doesn't belong to you.
AID00106149	Hey! Give it back!

AID00106165	I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
AID00106166	Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
AID00106167	Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?
AID00106168	That isn't yours!
AID00106169	I saw you take that!
AID00106170	That's stealing!
AID00106171	Yield
AID00106172	Please, have mercy!
AID00106173	AcceptYield
AID00106174	Better not try that again.
AID00106175	Smart move.
AID00106176	Don't let it happen again.
AID00106177	All right. I'll let it go - this time.
AID00106178	You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
AID00106179	The ultimate insult is to be spared.
AID00106180	All right, but don't let it happen again!

AID00107162	Hello...?
AID00107163	That wasn't you, was it.
AID00107164	Hear something, doesn't sound like a friend of yours.

AID00107202	Who's ready to have their ass kicked?
AID00107203	AlertToNormal
AID00107204	Whatever. I've got better things to do.
AID00107205	Hmm. Nothing here after all.
AID00107206	Ah, just getting jumpy I guess.
AID00107207	Guess it was nothing.
AID00107208	All clear.
AID00107209	I've finished my sweep. Nothing to report.
AID00107210	Everyone back to your posts.
AID00107211	Something must be wrong with my suit's audio receptors.
AID00107212	Area secured.
AID00107213	Everything's quiet here. Heading back.
AID00107214	Someone must be fucking with me.

AID00107221	Alright, just my imagination.
AID00107222	My mind is playing tricks on me. I gotta get laid.
AID00107223	Guess I'm seeing things.
AID00107224	Aw, forget this.
AID00107225	Guess it was just in my head.
AID00107226	Suspending search.
AID00107227	Canceling search.
AID00107228	Halting search.
AID00107229	I think they left, Rhonda.
AID00107230	Must've been my imagination.
AID00107231	Whatever it was is gone now.
AID00107232	No sense wasting more time looking.
AID00107233	Just a noise. Gone now.
AID00107234	What was I doing again? Oh well.
AID00107235	Nothing there. Stupid noise fooled me.

AID00107243	I must be going as crazy as ol' Rex.
AID00107244	Guess I'm hearing things.
AID00107245	Probably just a rat.
AID00107246	Bah, it's nothing.

AID00107255	Nothing here, I guess.
AID00107256	Gone now.
AID00107257	Meh.
AID00107258	Ah, forget it.
AID00107259	I worry too much.
AID00107260	Sorry, boss. Must be my glaucomas acting up again.
AID00107261	If you say you saw something, I'm sure it was there.

AID00107263	Yeah, better run. Uh, them, not us.
AID00107264	Not worth our time.
AID00107265	Nothing. Must be nerves.
AID00107266	Let's move on.
AID00107267	Leo's playing tricks again.
AID00107268	It's okay, sweetheart, there aren't any monsters out there.
AID00107269	We're all alone now, pumpkin.
AID00107270	Just bugs I guess.
AID00107271	Get a grip, Doc.
AID00107272	Ears must be actin' up.

AID00107276	Must've been nothing.
AID00107277	I've got better things to do.
AID00107278	Oh, well.
AID00107279	Need to stop jumping at shadows.

AID00107281	Whatever it was, it's gone now.
AID00107282	Just a noise.

AID00107295	Threat analysis: green. Security sweep canceled.
AID00107296	Oh well. Maybe next time you'll introduce yourself.
AID00107297	Why did you run away? I'm really not as scary as I look.
AID00107298	You shouldn't tease me like that.
AID00107299	All clear.
AID00107300	Area secure.
AID00107301	False alarm. Standing down.
AID00107302	Back to the usual daily tedium.
AID00107303	Thought as much. Nothing there after all.
AID00107304	Beastly nuisance. Glad that's done with.
AID00107305	Another glorious day in the U.S. army.
AID00107306	False alarm. Stand down, people.
AID00107307	Nothing I like better than a little R&R on Uncle Sam's dime.
AID00107308	CombatToNormal
AID00107309	Well, that's the end of that.
AID00107310	Teach you to mess with me.
AID00107311	That takes care of that.
AID00107312	Phew. I'm glad that's over.
AID00107313	So fall the enemies of the Brotherhood.
AID00107314	Technology prevails.
AID00107315	Situation handled.
AID00107316	Hostile eliminated.
AID00107317	Tag 'em and bag 'em.
AID00107318	We're done here.
AID00107319	You're lucky I didn't find you.
AID00107320	That's right, run.
AID00107321	Fucking chicken.
AID00107322	Degenerate.
AID00107323	That's it, run away.
AID00107324	Coward.
AID00107325	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
AID00107326	I didn't think you had it in you.
AID00107327	You can run, but you can't hide forever.
AID00107328	We'll save a shell for you.
AID00107329	Glad that's over with.
AID00107330	Good riddance.

AID00107333	I'm glad that's over with.
AID00107334	I guess that could have gone worse.
AID00107335	Guess we made it.
AID00107336	Target lost. Engagement successful.
AID00107337	Target lost. No further action needed.
AID00107338	Target lost. Returning to non-combat operations.
AID00107339	What trickery is this? Only nightkin should vanish like that!
AID00107340	Looks like I got my exercise for today.
AID00107341	And that's that.
AID00107342	That'll teach them to mess with mutants.
AID00107343	Ha ha. Too weak.
AID00107344	Done with you now.
AID00107345	Fight's over. Back to boring walking around.
AID00107346	Stupid weak things never last long.
AID00107347	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
AID00107348	Glad that's over.
AID00107349	Coward.
AID00107350	That's it, run away.
AID00107351	Degenerate.
AID00107352	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00107353	Done and done.
AID00107354	Done and done.
AID00107355	Hope you enjoyed your stay in Freeside.
AID00107356	And... we're done here.
AID00107357	The Kings reign supreme.
AID00107358	Is that it?
AID00107359	
AID00107360	Not here...? Just saw, of course here?*shut up stupid head voice!*
AID00107361	Stupid head voice.
AID00107362	All right, it's over.
AID00107363	Whew.
AID00107364	I've had worse.
AID00107365	That's enough of that.
AID00107366	Wow, I'm actually still alive. Who would have guessed?
AID00107367	I'm sure our victory was purely thanks to your brilliant leadership, boss.
AID00107368	I guess old guys are tougher than we look, huh?
AID00107369	Glad that's over.
AID00107370	In no mood for hunting.
AID00107371	It's okay, sweetheart, the bad people are all gone now.
AID00107372	That will teach them to mess with my babies!
AID00107373	Leo won't be happy there's no one else to chop!
AID00107374	I'm supposed to be retired.
AID00107375	No more fightin' for me.
AID00107376	That's enough.
AID00107377	Looks like they hightailed it.
AID00107378	Looks like I run them off.
AID00107379	Guess they threw up the sponge.
AID00107380	That wraps that up.
AID00107381	Coward.
AID00107382	Guess I'm done here.
AID00107383	You should've known better.
AID00107384	Well, that's that.
AID00107385	Hahaha!
AID00107386	Ah, well.
AID00107387	Excitement's over, I guess.
AID00107388	Kids these days...
AID00107389	Glad that's over with.
AID00107390	Guess you're not so tough.
AID00107391	Probably afraid of me.

AID00107403	I'll always remember you. My memory circuits have almost unlimited capacity.
AID00107404	Situation... normal. Law and order has been restored.
AID00107405	Attention citizens. You may now resume your normal activities.
AID00107406	Law and order has prevailed.
AID00107407	A little peace and quiet, at last.
AID00107408	Well, that's it then.
AID00107409	That's enough excitement for one day.
AID00107410	That's how we do things in the U.S. army! Hoo-ah!

AID00107419	Target lost. Begin full grid search.
AID00107420	Does anyone see the hostile?
AID00107421	Where'd he go?
AID00107422	Where'd she go?
AID00107423	Think you can hide, huh?
AID00107424	I can smell your fear.
AID00107425	Don't think I don't know where you are.
AID00107426	You'd better hide.
AID00107427	You can't hide from me!
AID00107428	You won't escape me!
AID00107429	I'll find you!
AID00107430	Show yourself, Outsider.
AID00107431	Come out, come out, wherever you are.
AID00107432	Do you think you can hide from me?
AID00107433	You're gonna pay for that when I find you.
AID00107434	Where the fuck did you go?
AID00107435	We'll find ya' one way or another.
AID00107436	Target lost. Searching.
AID00107437	Target lost. Attempting to reacquire.
AID00107438	Target lost. Analyzing.
AID00107439	Where'd they go, Rhonda?
AID00107440	Damn, this one's tricky!
AID00107441	Be on your guard! The enemy is still here!
AID00107442	Damn! Lost 'em!

AID00107453	Don't think you can get away.
AID00107454	Whoa. Spooky.
AID00107455	Must've blinked or something.
AID00107456	That's right. Run!

AID00107470	Hide nor hair of them.
AID00107471	Fucker pops back up, they'll wish they hadn't.
AID00107472	Picked the wrong time for hide and seek.
AID00107473	Where'd you go?
AID00107474	Grandma will find them, sugar, don't you worry!
AID00107475	Do you see them, Leo? I don't see them!

AID00107501	Where did you go? Was it something I said?
AID00107502	I'm coming to find you now. I'm afraid my programming does not allow me to let you get away.
AID00107503	You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
AID00107504	Do not attempt to flee. You will be identified and sanctioned.
AID00107505	Fugitive is attempting to evade capture. Beginning pursuit.
AID00107506	Initiating search for hostile target.
AID00107507	Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
AID00107508	Must we play hide and seek now?
AID00107509	Ready or not, here I come!
AID00107510	That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
AID00107511	Somebody find me something to shoot at!
AID00107512	Who's got a target?
AID00107513	Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
AID00107514	LostToNormal
AID00107515	I can't find anything.
AID00107516	Hmm. Oh well.
AID00107517	Must have got away.
AID00107518	Guess she's gone.
AID00107519	Guess he's gone.
AID00107520	Huh. Looks like they left.
AID00107521	Stand down. The hostile's gone.
AID00107522	Must've scared them off.
AID00107523	Call off the search. They got away.
AID00107524	Damn it, they're not here.
AID00107525	All clear.
AID00107526	What a punk.
AID00107527	Chicken ass.
AID00107528	Time to find some more psycho.
AID00107529	I scared them away. No match for the Legion.
AID00107530	I'll kill them if they come back.
AID00107531	It seems they ran off.
AID00107532	I guess the outsider left.
AID00107533	I bet the coward ran back to those NCR fools.
AID00107534	Guess they're too scared to fight.
AID00107535	I got you next time.
AID00107536	Be glad I didn't find your punk ass.
AID00107537	Fuck this, I got shit to do.
AID00107538	Search operations suspended. Have a nice day.
AID00107539	Canceling search. Have a nice day.
AID00107540	Halting search. Have a nice day.
AID00107541	The True Eyes show me the intruder is gone.
AID00107542	They're gone. No sense in looking any more.
AID00107543	We're wasting time. Call off the search.
AID00107544	This is a waste of time.
AID00107545	Hmph, they're long gone.
AID00107546	Stupid hider.
AID00107547	Hmph. Tired of looking.
AID00107548	Fine! Hide for all I care!
AID00107549	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00107550	Let's bounce, boys.
AID00107551	Guess he's gone.
AID00107552	Guess she's gone.
AID00107553	I'll kill them if they come back.
AID00107554	I scared them away. No match for the Legion.
AID00107555	All right, I'm offically saying screw this.
AID00107556	Let's go home, boys.
AID00107557	This is dullsville. Let's bounce.
AID00107558	Let's go do something else.
AID00107559	You're not worth my time.
AID00107560	Maybe stupid head voice was right?
AID00107561	Was definitely there. Not crazy.
AID00107562	You come back, I kill you.
AID00107563	Gone for now.
AID00107564	Gone. Huh.
AID00107565	I guess they're gone. Probably for the best.
AID00107566	Got away.
AID00107567	I give up.
AID00107568	Probably die of natural causes eventually anyway.
AID00107569	Ah, screw it.
AID00107570	Maybe they just... went home, huh boss?
AID00107571	I got nothing, here.
AID00107572	Doubtless they ran away in sheer terror of the mighty Raul! Oh, and you too, boss.
AID00107573	Guess they got rattled.
AID00107574	Get 'em next time.
AID00107575	Got no patience for hunting.
AID00107576	If they come back, Leo will be waiting!
AID00107577	It's probably best to leave well enough alone, dearie.
AID00107578	The bad men have all gone away, sweetness. Grandma's here to protect you.
AID00107579	Hard to believe I scared somebody off.
AID00107580	Up and left on me.
AID00107581	Gone now...
AID00107582	Seems they made like a ghost.
AID00107583	It would appear they skedaddled.
AID00107584	I guess I run them off.
AID00107585	Damn, guess they're gone.
AID00107586	Long gone by now.
AID00107587	Fine, stay hidden for all I care.
AID00107588	Dammit. Got away.
AID00107589	Maybe next time.
AID00107590	Ah, to hell with this.
AID00107591	I ain't chasin' 'em.
AID00107592	This is too much runnin' for an old man.
AID00107593	Someone younger can run after 'em.
AID00107594	Must be gone by now...
AID00107595	Not really worth looking for anyway.
AID00107596	Okay, I give up.
AID00107597	Fine. I'll get your ass next time.
AID00107598	Next time, then.
AID00107599	Shit. Guess I lost 'em.
AID00107600	Gary?  Gary?
AID00107601	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure. Resuming standard operations.
AID00107602	Threat analysis: green. Perimeter secure.
AID00107603	Threat analysis: green. No hostiles detected.
AID00107604	Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
AID00107605	I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
AID00107606	I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
AID00107607	Hostile has escaped. Transmitting description to designated law enforcement authorities.
AID00107608	Fugitive has evaded pursuit. Law enforcement authorities now have primary responsibility for apprehension.
AID00107609	Search complete. No hostiles detected. Standing down.
AID00107610	Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
AID00107611	The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
AID00107612	This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
AID00107613	LostToCombat
AID00107614	You can't hide from me.
AID00107615	Aha!
AID00107616	Thought hiding would save you?
AID00107617	There you are!
AID00107618	Found the hostile!
AID00107619	The target's over here!
AID00107620	There you are!
AID00107621	Visual confirmation made.
AID00107622	Target reacquired!
AID00107623	I knew I'd find your bitch ass.
AID00107624	You're dead now.
AID00107625	I'm not going to let you get away.
AID00107626	You're mine!
AID00107627	I see you!
AID00107628	I found you!
AID00107629	I got you now!
AID00107630	Let's do this!
AID00107631	It's on!
AID00107632	You thought you could lay low?
AID00107633	I'm gonna grease you good.
AID00107634	There you are.
AID00107635	Target found.
AID00107636	Target reacquired.
AID00107637	Target found. Engaging.
AID00107638	You can't escape my True Eyes!
AID00107639	Ah, there you are!
AID00107640	I've found the enemy!
AID00107641	You'll have to hide better than that!
AID00107642	Hide from this!
AID00107643	Made me look! Made me mad!
AID00107644	No - more - hiding!
AID00107645	There you are!
AID00107646	I found you!
AID00107647	I see you!
AID00107648	You're mine!
AID00107649	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00107650	There you are!
AID00107651	Not so sneaky, are we?
AID00107652	Gotcha!
AID00107653	There you are!
AID00107654	Couldn't run forever...
AID00107655	Nowhere to run now!
AID00107656	Ah hah!
AID00107657	Got you now!
AID00107658	Now you die!
AID00107659	Target reacquired!
AID00107660	Over there!
AID00107661	I see 'em!
AID00107662	Oh! There we go!
AID00107663	Busted!
AID00107664	Found 'em!
AID00107665	There we go!
AID00107666	Couldn't even hide from a half-blind old ghoul. How embarassing for you.
AID00107667	Got 'em, boss!
AID00107668	All right, let's try this again.
AID00107669	Got 'em!
AID00107670	Gonna kill you for wasting my time.
AID00107671	Should've run, now say your prayers.
AID00107672	There they are! Get them, Leo!
AID00107673	We found you!
AID00107674	You can't hide from your paddling!
AID00107675	You're done hidin'!
AID00107676	Shoulda gone quietly.
AID00107677	Knew it!
AID00107678	Draw, pardner!
AID00107679	Prepare to run against the pill!
AID00107680	Yeehaw!
AID00107681	Got ya!
AID00107682	Knew you'd turn up sooner or later.
AID00107683	Ah, there you are!
AID00107684	There you are.
AID00107685	Let's finish what we started.
AID00107686	Nice try.
AID00107687	There ya are!
AID00107688	Couldn't hide, could ya?
AID00107689	Got my eye on you now!
AID00107690	You're mine!
AID00107691	Now it ends!
AID00107692	Got 'em!
AID00107693	Found you!
AID00107694	There you are!

AID00107702	You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
AID00107703	My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
AID00107704	Fugitive has been located. Commencing attack.
AID00107705	Your attempted escape is only making things worse for you.
AID00107706	Do not make any further escape attempts, lawbreaker.
AID00107707	You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
AID00107708	You can run, but you can't hide!
AID00107709	Your worthless hide is mine!
AID00107710	Come on. I'm not so bad. There's more you want to tell me, isn't there?
AID00107711	PersuasionAttemptFailure
AID00107712	Never mind then.
AID00107713	SpeechChallengeFailure
AID00107714	That's just the kind of thing I'd be expecting them to say. Which proves you're not with them.
AID00107715	Well, that's a load off. What do you want to know?
AID00107716	No, I don't think I have much to offer in that department either. Too many blows to the head during combat drills.
AID00107717	Do you think that men go bald normally? I am sick, and I have embraced my change. Leave me be.
AID00107718	AlertIdle
AID00107719	Anybody there?
AID00107720	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
AID00107721	What was that?
AID00107722	Who's there?
AID00107723	It's only a matter of time.
AID00107724	We will find you!
AID00107725	Come out and face your death!
AID00107726	Reveal yourself and I promise the end will come quick.
AID00107727	This grows tiresome.
AID00107728	This little sneak is beginning to vex me.
AID00107729	When I find you I'm going to eat your spleen.
AID00107730	You're out here somewhere.
AID00107731	You won't escape me.
AID00107732	Show yourself and I may let you live.
AID00107733	I thought I heard something...
AID00107734	Where'd you go, punk?
AID00107735	Come out. I just want to talk.
AID00107736	Pretty sure I heard something.
AID00107737	Is there someone out there?
AID00107738	You're not getting away.
AID00107739	I know you're out there!
AID00107740	What was that?
AID00107741	Analyzing.
AID00107742	Interpreting sense data.
AID00107743	Target unconfirmed.
AID00107744	I know I heard something. Don't worry, Rhonda. We'll find them.
AID00107745	Hiding just delays the inevitable.
AID00107746	Keep looking, everyone.
AID00107747	I know you're here.
AID00107748	Why don't you come out?
AID00107749	Show yourself!
AID00107750	Where'd you go, punk?
AID00107751	Who's there?
AID00107752	I thought I heard something...
AID00107753	You won't escape me.
AID00107754	Show yourself and I may let you live.
AID00107755	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00107756	Don't make me come looking for you.
AID00107757	You better hope I don't find you.
AID00107758	Come out, if you dare.
AID00107759	Save us both some time and come on out.
AID00107760	Don't make me come looking for you.
AID00107761	Just stay right where you are. I'll find you.
AID00107762	Huh?
AID00107763	What was that?
AID00107764	Wuh?
AID00107765	Hmm.
AID00107766	Keep looking.
AID00107767	What's going on?
AID00107768	Huh.
AID00107769	Stay sharp.
AID00107770	Got my eyes peeled.
AID00107771	Still looking.
AID00107772	Hmm.
AID00107773	Hmm.
AID00107774	I'm looking, I'm looking!
AID00107775	Hope you're looking, boss, because I don't see so good.
AID00107776	Anything moves, it's going to get it.
AID00107777	Don't see a thing.
AID00107778	Wish they'd show themselves.
AID00107779	I don't see them anywhere, Leo! Do you?
AID00107780	You can't hide from grandma!
AID00107781	If you don't come out soon, ooh, you're going to get such a paddling!
AID00107782	I don't like this.
AID00107783	Somethin' don't feel right.
AID00107784	Hmm...
AID00107785	I do believe I heard somethin'.
AID00107786	Now what was that?
AID00107787	Hmm?
AID00107788	Come on out!
AID00107789	What was that?
AID00107790	Thought I heard something.
AID00107791	Something over there?
AID00107792	What was that?
AID00107793	Don't see anything, yet...
AID00107794	Hm?
AID00107795	What?
AID00107796	Strange...
AID00107797	Anyone there?
AID00107798	Hello?
AID00107799	What was that noise?
AID00107800	Huh?
AID00107801	Somethin' there?

AID00107808	Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
AID00107809	Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
AID00107810	I'll find you eventually, you know.
AID00107811	Where are you?
AID00107812	Scanning for hostiles.
AID00107813	This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
AID00107814	Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
AID00107815	It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
AID00107816	Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
AID00107817	Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
AID00107818	As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
AID00107819	Why not let the robot deal with it?
AID00107820	I'm going to look over here now.
AID00107821	Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
AID00107822	Step forward and identify yourself!
AID00107823	Do you think you can hide from me?
AID00107824	Do you think you can hide from me?
AID00107825	I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
AID00107826	Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
AID00107827	I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
AID00107828	LostIdle
AID00107829	I've got something for you...
AID00107830	You can't hide from me forever.

AID00107832	I'll find you.
AID00107833	Still no sign of the hostile.
AID00107834	Continuing sweep.
AID00107835	The target can't have gone far.
AID00107836	Keep searching.
AID00107837	Anyone spot anything?
AID00107838	Where the hell did you go?
AID00107839	You can't hide from me.
AID00107840	Don't let me find you.
AID00107841	I know where you went.
AID00107842	You won't escape me!
AID00107843	Skulking like a coward will not save you!
AID00107844	By Caesar, I will find you.
AID00107845	I'm gonna pop you when I find you again.
AID00107846	Show yourself.
AID00107847	I can hear you breathing, Outsider.
AID00107848	I'll blow this place apart if I have to.
AID00107849	When I find you I'm gonna rip you a new one.
AID00107850	Come out, come out, whever you are.
AID00107851	Come out now, and Tabitha will be merciful. Or at least an approximation thereof.
AID00107852	Still searching.
AID00107853	Still analyzing.
AID00107854	Still attempting to reacquire target.
AID00107855	Keep looking! They're here somewhere!
AID00107856	Be on your guard! The enemy could be anywhere!
AID00107857	You can't hide forever...
AID00107858	If I were a scared little thing, where would I hide?
AID00107859	Where are you?
AID00107860	Come out and fight!
AID00107861	Hiding boring! Fighting much more fun!
AID00107862	Before, just going to kill you. But now, going to kill you real bad!
AID00107863	I'll find you.
AID00107864	By Caesar, I will find you.
AID00107865	Skulking like a coward will not save you!
AID00107866	You won't escape me!
AID00107867	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00107868	What say you come out and we play some more?
AID00107869	C'mon. Less hiding, more fighting!
AID00107870	Come out, come out, wherever you are...
AID00107871	We *will* find you, you know.
AID00107872	You're only delaying the inevitable.
AID00107873	I'm starting to get bored.
AID00107874	What say you come out and take your asskicking like a man?
AID00107875	Not seeing things! You're out there!
AID00107876	Stupid head voice wrong! I know you're there!
AID00107877	You come back!
AID00107878	Nothing yet.
AID00107879	Gotta still be here...
AID00107880	Keep looking.
AID00107881	Still nothing...
AID00107882	Uh...
AID00107883	Not seeing anything...
AID00107884	Still looking, boss.
AID00107885	Amazingly, they've still managed to outwit a half-blind arthritic ghoul.
AID00107886	Don't worry boss, you'll know if I find anything.
AID00107887	Think they ran?
AID00107888	Less hide-and-seek, more shoot-and-kill.
AID00107889	I see jack and shit - 'cept no jack.
AID00107890	
AID00107891	Not finding much.

AID00107906	This isn't over!
AID00107907	Hm?
AID00107908	You just disappear?
AID00107909	You still there?
AID00107910	Don't think you can hide forever.
AID00107911	You're dead, you hear me?
AID00107912	Come out, come out wherever you are!
AID00107913	Ah shit, when I find you...
AID00107914	You think you'll get away from me?
AID00107915	Runnin' away like a little bitch!

AID00108012	Well, then, let grandma see what she's got....
AID00108013	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
AID00108014	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
AID00108015	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
AID00108016	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
AID00108017	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
AID00108018	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
AID00108019	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.

AID00108037	Uh... Am I broadcasting? I'm broadcasting? Shit, ok. This is the NCR Emergency channel. It sounds like the Hoover Dam is under attack. Stay tuned.
AID00108038	Rangers have managed to hold off a Legion attack at Camp Golf. Some casualties, but Camp Golf stands.
AID00108039	Rangers have barely managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. The numbers had not yet been reinforced to replace the missing troops.
AID00108040	Camp Golf has fallen! Apparently a small group of troopers broke rank and fled their posts once the battle began.
AID00108041	A group of troopers, that can only be described as rag-tag, managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. I salute your bravery. Hold the front.
AID00108042	Troopers have managed to contain several small riots that were breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas.
AID00108043	There is chaos breaking out at McCarran. The Fiends are using the opportunity to attack the base.
AID00108044	There are also several riots breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas. The looters have taken to the streets.
AID00108045	There is a confirmed report that the Legion mounted a simultaneous assault at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00108046	Yes Forlorn Hope has fallen. Some troops managed to fall back, but the fortification is lost.
AID00108047	Forlorn Hope has sustained heavy casualties, but the fortification stands. We have successfully defended Forlorn Hope.
AID00108048	I'm not getting any more information from Forlorn Hope. The Camp appears to have been totally overrun.
AID00108049	I'm receiving reports that Forlorn Hope has been totally overrun, and the Legion is killing civilians as far as the township called Novac.
AID00108050	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion attack with very few casualties.
AID00108051	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion in what will surely be the most decisive victory in this entire battle.
AID00108052	What the fuck is happening on the Strip? I'm getting reports that someone just bombed the embassy.
AID00108053	It sounds like the Omertas are mounting some sort of attack on the Strip. They are receiving heavy casualties from the Securitrons and other casinos.
AID00108054	The attack is coming from the Omertas. They are using some kind of gas to kill everyone in the casinos on the strip. How is this possible?
AID00108055	The monorail at Camp McCarran just exploded. I'm not getting any reports of any fighting, but the monorail is gone for sure.
AID00108056	We aren't going to be able to reinforce the Strip against the Omerta assault there. How the fuck did this happen? Jesus.
AID00108057	There is some sort of obstruction on the road to Hoover Dam. We're going to do our best to send reinforcements around.
AID00108058	Deploying battalion 14 to the southwestern flank.
AID00108059	Unit 15 reinforce unit 16 at defense point sigma delta.

AID00108091	Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is Mr. New Vegas. Thank you very very much for listening.
AID00108092	Hello ladies and gentlemen. Mr. New Vegas here. You're all so great, we're gonna keep you listening all day.
AID00108093	Howdy folks, it's Mr. New Vegas, and I have a good feeling about all of you listening.
AID00108094	Welcome back to the Mr. New Vegas Show, the show with, in my opinion - which I respect - the best looking audience around. Somebody prove me wrong.
AID00108095	Me again, Mr. New Vegas, reminding you that you're nobody till somebody loves you. And that somebody is me. I love you.
AID00108096	Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to me, Mr. New Vegas, and you look extraordinarily beautiful right now.
AID00108097	This is Radio New Vegas, and I'm your host, Mr. New Vegas. And in case you're wondering if you've come to the right place, you have.
AID00108098	You know, I tried to measure my charisma on a Vit-o-matic Vigor Tester once. The machine burst into flames.
AID00108099	The women of New Vegas ask me a lot if there's a Mrs. New Vegas. Of course there is. You're her. And you're still as perfect as the day we met.
AID00108100	This is Mr. New Vegas, fanning the flames of your passion.
AID00108101	And we're back. This is Mr. New Vegas, and I feel something magic in the air tonight. And I'm not just talking about the gamma radiation.
AID00108102	Welcome back to the program. This is Mr. New Vegas, and I hope I'm not comin' on too strong.
AID00108103	You're listening to Radio New Vegas, your little jukebox in the Mojave Wasteland. I'm Mr. New Vegas, and I'm here for you.
AID00108104	Hey, it's Mr. New Vegas, letting you know I've got a new Christmas compilation coming out soon. Nuclear Winter Wonderland. Look for it on holotape.
AID00108105	Bravo, come in, Bravo. Is anyone out there?
AID00108106	The camp was attacked. I think I'm the only one left alive.
AID00108107	We were attacked by some kind of freak mutants from the caves. Please send backup!
AID00108108	God damn leg... I don't know how much longer I'm going to make it before I bleed out.
AID00108109	Bravo, this is Camp Guardian calling for backup. No sign of the rest of the men stationed here.
AID00108110	This is Private Halford requesting backup. Anyone out there?
AID00108111	Guardian is down. I repeat Guardian is down. Requesting backup from any nearby forces.
AID00108112	Those beasts drug the rest of the men away. Oh God, I hope they don't come back for me.

AID00108149	I need to get going.
AID00108150	I'm looking for my father. Middle-aged guy. Maybe you've seen him?
AID00108151	I could use some directions around town.

AID00108154	Nice town you got here, sheriff. It's a pleasure to meet you.
AID00108155	Let's talk about something else.
AID00108156	Is there a weapons dealer around here?

AID00108167	I have to go now.
AID00108168	Tell me about the Family.
AID00108169	Can you tell me more about what's been going on around here?
AID00108170	None of your business.

AID00108172	I'm looking for Ian West. Have you seen him?

AID00108174	If you've got a point, make it.
AID00108175	It does?
AID00108176	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Couldn't we at least warn them?
AID00108177	It's time for me to go.
AID00108178	Messing with that bomb seems pretty... technical. What if I can't do it?
AID00108179	What's so special about this Tenpenny Tower?
AID00108180	If I destroy Megaton, I'll lose access to all of the town's services....
AID00108181	You're out of your mind, Burke. There's no way I'm helping you.
AID00108182	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
AID00108183	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave, now, and never come back. Understood?
AID00108184	Throw in a 300 cap bonus, and you've got yourself a deal
AID00108185	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
AID00108186	Wait... You want me to help you destroy the town?
AID00108187	And how do you propose I do that?
AID00108188	What's the word around town?
AID00108189	Let's cut to the chase. How much for you to tell me where my father is?
AID00108190	Tell me where he is, Moriarty, or I'll beat it out of you!
AID00108191	Cut the bullshit, Moriarty. I want the truth. How can you possibly know me?
AID00108192	Look, I just want to find my Dad. Do you know where he is?
AID00108193	You're lying. The Vault's been sealed for 200 years!
AID00108194	Tell me what you know! Tell me everything!
AID00108195	Huh? My father and I were born in Vault 101...
AID00108196	I was kidding! Dad talked about you all time. Now really, where is he? <Lie.>
AID00108197	Actually, the sheriff will pay me to disarm the bomb...
AID00108198	I've disarmed the bomb, Mister Burke. That thing will never explode, now.
AID00108199	I could disarm that bomb for you, Simms. But it'd cost you.
AID00108200	I need you to repair some equipment.
AID00108201	Show me what you've got.
AID00108202	I met a man named Burke. He said he'd pay me to rig the bomb to explode.
AID00108203	The bomb can't be disarmed, Simms. In fact, I plan to detonate it.
AID00108204	I need to buy some Chems.

AID00108210	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00108211	I want to buy a drink.
AID00108212	Let's talk about my father.
AID00108213	Sounds like you're pretty screwed. You're on your own.
AID00108214	I'd be glad to help. What do you need?

AID00108280	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
AID00108281	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave... now.
AID00108282	Throw in an extra 500 caps, and you've got yourself a deal.
AID00108283	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
AID00108284	Wait... You're going to destroy the town?
AID00108285	Go on. I'm listening.
AID00108286	If you've got a point, make it.
AID00108287	It does?
AID00108288	It does?
AID00108289	Mister Burke, is it? Please, continue. I find myself... enthralled.
AID00108290	Why don't you fight back?
AID00108291	Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny.
AID00108292	What can you tell me about Tenpenny Tower?
AID00108293	You know, I'm not as bad off as I thought.
AID00108294	I need a new face, doc.
AID00108295	I think I've broken something.
AID00108296	Just heal me, doc.
AID00108297	I need your help, doc.
AID00108298	I'd like to do business with you.
AID00108299	Unfortunately you can't force a man's attentions.
AID00108300	I have some ant queen pheromones that might do the trick.
AID00108301	Okay, I believe you. I was just curious about it.
AID00108302	If you don't stop seeing her, I'll tell Father Clifford about it.
AID00108303	I saw them myself, on the light deck. Under the stars... <Lie.>
AID00108304	It's just a rumor. I'd ask Diego about it first.
AID00108305	Suicide is a sin. Kill yourself, and your soul won't go to Heaven.
AID00108306	What about Ted? He needs guidance. A father figure.
AID00108307	Couldn't save your family, can't kill yourself... You're fucking pathetic.
AID00108308	Real courage is living. Only cowards commit suicide.
AID00108309	If that's what you really want, I'll help you.
AID00108310	This letter is all Ian has left of his old life. Allow me to give it to him.
AID00108311	I find this all very hard to believe.
AID00108312	Ian shouldn't be here. He has family that misses him.
AID00108313	You do this by teaching them that they're mythical beings?
AID00108314	I still say you're cannibals.
AID00108315	If I said vampires, and you said I was right, we'd both be crazy.
AID00108316	Please, help me understand your Laws.
AID00108317	I don't have time for chit-chat. Tell me where Ian is. Now!
AID00108318	You people murdered his parents!
AID00108319	This may sound odd, but is there a trainyard outside Arefu?
AID00108320	The Wests had bite marks on their necks. Mean anything to you?
AID00108321	Did you know the Wests are dead?
AID00108322	No. I'm done with you.
AID00108323	Yes.
AID00108324	Initiate triage protocol.
AID00108325	If Lucy is still alive I bet she misses you.
AID00108326	I'm sorry, Ian, but your parents are dead.

AID00108335	Won't that be dangerous?
AID00108336	You have to go now? Can't this wait?
AID00108337	All right. Let's get going.
AID00108338	What do we need to do right now?
AID00108339	What's our goal here?
AID00108340	No way. I'm not doing this.
AID00108341	Okay. Where do I need to go?
AID00108342	Why me? Can't someone else do it?
AID00108343	Invalid choice list coming up.
AID00108344	I don't know, maybe.
AID00108345	Here, maybe this will shut you up. <Give a Nuka-Cola Quantum.>
AID00108346	Yeah. I'm sorry, Sierra. Here's a Nuka-Cola Quantum for you!
AID00108347	No way! I'm not scouring the Wasteland for some stupid soft drink!
AID00108348	Glowing pee? That sounds like dangerous stuff!
AID00108349	Let me think about this, Sierra.
AID00108350	MS05SierraCT15b
AID00108351	I think I've had just about enough of this.
AID00108352	I think I'd rather be smacked in the head with a blunt instrument.
AID00108353	Look, lady. I just want to get out of this nuthouse...
AID00108354	Yeah, I guess you're right. It isn't that bad.

AID00108379	Sure. Do it.

AID00108381	Lead the way. Let's not waste any time.
AID00108382	How do we get out of here?
AID00108383	I'm not leaving my father in there!
AID00108384	You don't need to be such an asshole...
AID00108385	He's just trying to do the right thing.
AID00108386	Anything I should know about this place?
AID00108387	Do you think Project Purity will ever work again?
AID00108388	What's your story?
AID00108389	You're right. What do you need me to do?
AID00108390	You're not in charge here.
AID00108391	What do you mean, "If we can make it"?
AID00108392	Wait here. I'll scout ahead.
AID00108393	Let's get moving. Follow me.
AID00108394	You have a plan?
AID00108395	What's up ahead? You seem nervous.
AID00108396	Excuse me?
AID00108397	Where to now?
AID00108398	MQ05LiEndSpeech
AID00108399	Can we talk about, you know... mom?
AID00108400	Is it true, Dad? Was everyone born in the Vault?
AID00108401	Do we have to die in the Vault? Can't we ever leave?
AID00108402	Anything I need to know about the G.O.A.T.?
AID00108403	But, I'm sick. Really. <Lie.>

AID00108408	If you say so.
AID00108409	Oh, I get it! Butch is the leader. You're just... a follower.
AID00108410	Why do you listen to Butch?
AID00108411	CG03TunnelSnakeResponse1
AID00108412	Look, Amata, this is none of my business. I don't want to get involved...
AID00108413	You have to fight your own battles. I can't help you with everything...
AID00108414	I'll see if I can talk some sense into them.
AID00108415	If you keep messing with her, the Overseer is going to come down on your gang.
AID00108416	Maybe I can help. She's very sensitive about her weight...
AID00108417	Leave her alone, or you'll answer to me.
AID00108418	Hey, it's none of my business.
AID00108419	Looks like you're having fun.

AID00108426	Never mind. Let's just get back to work.
AID00108427	I think I understand. I'm glad we talked.
AID00108428	Just forget it. Let's get this over with.
AID00108429	Helping people? What about helping your own son?
AID00108430	Is this about mom? Are you trying so hard because of what happened to her?
AID00108431	Can't we just go back to the Vault, back to the way things were?
AID00108432	Why would you put yourself at risk like this? You have some sort of death wish?
AID00108433	Just what are you trying to do here?
AID00108434	How could you leave me like that? What the hell were you thinking?
AID00108435	Can we just talk for a minute?
AID00108436	I'll need some details before I can decide.
AID00108437	So you just disappear without saying a word?
AID00108438	You could have told me you were leaving.
AID00108439	You really think you can do this? Make this thing work?
AID00108440	Why would you throw away the life we had?
AID00108441	You know what? Fuck you, Dad.
AID00108442	How could abandoning me be the right choice?
AID00108443	I know it's painful, but let's talk about what happened in Arefu.
AID00108444	What can I do to help?
AID00108445	We don't have time for this shit. Let's go!
AID00108446	Let's go. This is no time to sit down.
AID00108447	What's the matter? Are you all right?
AID00108448	MQ05GarzaSick
AID00108449	Do I look like someone that you want to blow off?
AID00108450	I'm sorry to interrupt, Andy. I just had a few questions.
AID00108451	Let's go.
AID00108452	Wait here a minute.
AID00108453	Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Let me think a minute.
AID00108454	MS15HowAreYouDoing
AID00108455	What's our next move?
AID00108456	Nope, not interested.
AID00108457	Sure, let's team up.
AID00108458	What are you proposing?
AID00108459	I don't work with strangers.
AID00108460	What do you mean "fellow relic hunter"?
AID00108461	Yep. I sure am.
AID00108462	Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.
AID00108463	Can we stop beating around the bush, please? What's the reward?
AID00108464	Can the speech, Abe. I need to get paid.
AID00108465	I suppose that's good enough for me.
AID00108466	Yeah, what's my reward for all this legwork?
AID00108467	KurtTestTopic2
AID00108468	KurtTestTopic1
AID00108469	Um... no. I've still got more important things to do.
AID00108470	Not now. Maybe another time.
AID00108471	I'd love to be a part of history, and bring you the Declaration.
AID00108472	What does the Declaration of Independence look like?
AID00108473	Can you show me how to get to the National Archives on my map?
AID00108474	I have to go now.
AID00108475	Skip the history lesson, professor.
AID00108476	Let me take a leap of faith here... you want me to find it for you.
AID00108477	Maybe later. I've got better things to do right now.
AID00108478	Who cares...
AID00108479	All right, I'll bite. Which document is missing?
AID00108480	It's an interesting collection of garbage.
AID00108481	Yes, it's an interesting collection indeed.
AID00108482	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
AID00108483	I have to go, dad.
AID00108484	Can you help me find something else?
AID00108485	I'm actually just looking for some food.
AID00108486	I... uh... only drink for medicinal reasons.
AID00108487	Tell me about the Church of Atom.
AID00108488	I've been looking for you.
AID00108489	So what are you doing in the Metro tunnels?
AID00108490	Ah... Nevermind.
AID00108491	You eat people's brains, right? So what's it like being a zombie?
AID00108492	Whatever.
AID00108493	You're the prejudiced asshole, not me. So you're ugly. Big deal.
AID00108494	No, really. I mean it. I don't care if you're a Ghoul or not.
AID00108495	I didn't mean to offend. I'm not prejudiced.
AID00108496	So tell me, what's it like being a Ghoul?
AID00108497	I don't suppose you know my father? A doctor from Vault 101?

AID00108501	Let's talk about something else.
AID00108502	What the hell is wrong with you people?
AID00108503	Why do you worship the bomb?
AID00108504	What do you believe?
AID00108505	I found him. He's with the Family.
AID00108506	I haven't found him. <Lie.>
AID00108507	I found him. He's safe.
AID00108508	I give up. Fine, stay here and cry.
AID00108509	Look, Ian. I know loss, too. I know it hurts. But staying here isn't the answer.
AID00108510	You're a bitch to find.

AID00108518	No reason to hang around now, is there? Move it.
AID00108519	You're only going to slow us down. Maybe you should stay behind.
AID00108520	I've changed my mind.
AID00108521	<Donate 100 caps.>
AID00108522	<Donate 50 caps.>
AID00108523	<Donate 10 caps.>
AID00108524	I'd like to donate to the Church.
AID00108525	Who's in charge around here?
AID00108526	I need a drink.
AID00108527	That's all I needed to know.
AID00108528	MegDocChurchSupplie
AID00108529	I need to buy medical supplies.
AID00108530	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
AID00108531	Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
AID00108532	Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
AID00108533	Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
AID00108534	I don't see anything wrong with you.
AID00108535	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108536	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AID00108537	Let me take a look. Really? That's it? You've got a few scrapes and a hangnail. Come back when you're really hurt.
AID00108538	You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
AID00108539	Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
AID00108540	I don't see nothing wrong with you.
AID00108541	That's not the worst injury I've seen - hell, it's not even the worst this week. I think we can patch you up.
AID00108542	This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
AID00108543	That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
AID00108544	Don't look like nothing too serious. Lemme patch you up.
AID00108545	Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
AID00108546	Sure. I can help you out.
AID00108547	Yeah, that's looking pretty bad. I think we can do something about it though - just a minute.
AID00108548	Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
AID00108549	Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
AID00108550	It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
AID00108551	Holy God, what battlefield did you just crawl off of? I'm going to be honest, this is kind of out of my league, but I'll do what I can.
AID00108552	I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
AID00108553	This? This is nothing. You should see some of the wounds I've seen paladins come back with.
AID00108554	That's not so bad. I should be able to treat you rather quickly.
AID00108555	By Steel, I haven't seen wounds like these since HELIOS. I've got to get you treated quickly.
AID00108556	I'm sorry, but is that supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
AID00108557	I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
AID00108558	Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
AID00108559	This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
AID00108560	Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
AID00108561	Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
AID00108562	I don't see anything wrong with you.
AID00108563	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108564	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
AID00108565	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108566	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
AID00108567	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108568	You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
AID00108569	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108570	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
AID00108571	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AID00108572	That's disgusting.
AID00108573	You know, it's not so bad.
AID00108574	I've got nothing against you people.
AID00108575	I know what a Ghoul is. Now get away from me, zombie.
AID00108576	No. What's a ghoul?
AID00108577	I hadn't planned on it.
AID00108578	Are you kidding? Me? Shut the hell up, Ghoul. I'll beat you if I feel like it.
AID00108579	Let me think about it for a moment, my good man.
AID00108580	Stuff it, Ghoul. And stop looking at me.
AID00108581	Gah! Fuck! What are you?
AID00108582	What's in it for me?
AID00108583	I'll do it.
AID00108584	Do you know a way I can earn some money around here?
AID00108585	I don't think I can help you.
AID00108586	Ghosts? What are you talking about?
AID00108587	I think I have an idea what you might mean. Go on.
AID00108588	MegTownWhatsYourStory
AID00108589	What do you do around here?
AID00108590	Never mind...
AID00108591	Whatever your problem is, I suggest you get over it. Now.
AID00108592	Did I miss something? What's your problem with me?
AID00108593	Here, take this Magnum.
AID00108594	How about a Chinese Pistol?
AID00108595	I can give you a Silenced 10mm Pistol.
AID00108596	I've got a 10mm Pistol. Want it?
AID00108597	I've got a .32 caliber pistol.
AID00108598	Sorry, I don't have a pistol on me.
AID00108599	Can you help get us through this?
AID00108600	You'd better walk away right now.
AID00108601	My father is dead.
AID00108602	I don't have any meds on me, but what if we gave him some Buffout?
AID00108603	Maybe we should just leave him behind. He's slowing us down.
AID00108604	Forget it. I've got nothing.
AID00108605	Here, take some Stimpaks. That should get him through.
AID00108606	We need to do something about Garza.
AID00108607	Hey Leo, can you hook me up?
AID00108608	I understand you have quite a Chem habit...
AID00108609	Can you tell me anything about Vault-Tec Headquarters?
AID00108610	Is the Stradivarius worth a ton of caps?
AID00108611	How will I know the Stradivarius when I see it?
AID00108612	Do you have any information on Vault 92?
AID00108613	What do you know about the Soil Stradivarius?
AID00108614	Tell me a bit about your great-great-grandmother.
AID00108615	So, what am I supposed to do, scour the entire Wasteland asking about violins?
AID00108616	I know where Vault 92 is... I'll head there right away.
AID00108617	Any idea where Vault 92 is located?
AID00108618	More stories? Ugh...
AID00108619	Sorry to interrupt, but where can I find the violin?
AID00108620	I need some time to think about it.
AID00108621	All right. I give you my word I'll do my best to recover a violin for you.
AID00108622	I'm interested, but what will you give me in return?
AID00108623	A violin? That's hardly something that would have survived the war.
AID00108624	Let's cut to the chase. Is there something you need?
AID00108625	You built a homemade violin, huh? Impressive.
AID00108626	Your husband's radio can broadcast across the entire Capital Wasteland?
AID00108627	That sounds risky. What if the caravan never arrives?
AID00108628	Is there any way I can help?
AID00108629	What could you possibly have to trade?
AID00108630	I'm sorry, the heat must be getting to me. My apologies.
AID00108631	Whatever, grandma. Like I care.
AID00108632	Not my problem. Good luck, Sheriff.
AID00108633	You're nuts to live here. That thing will blow you all to Hell.
AID00108634	100 caps? All right, I'll take a look at it.
AID00108635	I don't need a reward. I couldn't sleep at night knowing you could all die.
AID00108636	Demolition expertise doesn't come cheap. I want 500 caps.

AID00108641	Does the town have a doctor?
AID00108642	Why is the town called Megaton?
AID00108643	Tell me more about your town.
AID00108644	Sure. Whatever.
AID00108645	So which do you like more, being mayor or being sheriff?
AID00108646	Surely you haven't severed all contacts?
AID00108647	I take it you don't get many visitors, then.
AID00108648	Oh, your husband's dead? I'm sorry.
AID00108649	I prefer to keep my business to myself. And I suggest you do the same.

AID00108651	That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.
AID00108652	That's all I needed.
AID00108653	What do you do here?
AID00108654	Who's in charge here?
AID00108655	I had some questions about the Citadel.
AID00108656	Yeah, whatever.

AID00109008	Screw this. I'm out of here.
AID00109009	I'd like to help, but nothing's free.
AID00109010	Yeah, let's do it.
AID00109011	I don't know a Reilly, and I'm out of here.
AID00109012	I don't know any Reilly, but I do know we need to get the hell off this roof.
AID00109013	Reilly? Who's that? Never heard of her.
AID00109014	He really shouldn't be here.
AID00109015	I could be his friend.
AID00109016	Ian's decided to stay with the Family.
AID00109017	Ian's decided to leave the Family.
AID00109018	That's impressive. Competition must be stiff around here.
AID00109019	You mean you were the best shot. I'm here now.
AID00109020	Sorry, I was just joking around.
AID00109021	Please. Like I'm afraid of you people.
AID00109022	Good to know.
AID00109023	Dusk? Oh, let me guess! Your real name's Dawn. Or is it Twilight?

AID00109029	How do I get through the radiation?
AID00109030	So what's the catch?
AID00109031	There's got to be another way.
AID00109032	So that's it? I'm screwed?
AID00109033	I really need to get by you. It's important I find what I'm looking for.
AID00109034	Hang on a second. I have a letter for Ian West from his sister.
AID00109035	I'm not telling you jack. Now let me get by!
AID00109036	Just exploring, sorry.
AID00109037	He doesn't belong here.
AID00109038	He's needed at home. His family is dead.
AID00109039	Can't you just help out without being so mean?
AID00109040	You really have a bad attitude.
AID00109041	I'm going to kick your ass all over this Metro station if you don't help me!
AID00109042	Great. Thanks for nothing.
AID00109043	Thanks for your help.
AID00109044	How do I deal with them, then?
AID00109045	You must be joking.
AID00109046	What's the story behind Little Lamplight?
AID00109047	You're kidding me, right?
AID00109048	Whoa, hold on there. I'm a friend.

AID00109076	Sure, whatever.
AID00109077	Stand down, and honorably relinquish your post. You've earned a rest.
AID00109078	Yes, Button. We won!
AID00109079	It will be brought to the State House for safe keeping.
AID00109080	It will be carried to our new President, Abraham Washington.

AID00109093	That old man's out of his mind.
AID00109094	He seems harmless.

AID00109154	How's the museum business?
AID00109155	I don't have 300 caps.
AID00109156	Fine, 300 caps. Now spill it.
AID00109157	Okay, let's just take a step back. 100 caps was reasonable, wasn't it?
AID00109158	This is ridiculous. Forget it.
AID00109159	There was something else...

AID00109166	Okay. Hold still.
AID00109167	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
AID00109168	Okay, that's about the best I can do. Try not to get hurt that bad again, it's not like I've got an endless supply of bandages.
AID00109169	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
AID00109170	All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
AID00109171	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
AID00109172	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
AID00109173	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00109174	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
AID00109175	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00109176	Then I'm sorry, but I don't have any treatment for you. My priority is helping the refugees here at this camp.
AID00109177	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00109178	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
AID00109179	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00109180	This might take a while. Close your eyes and try to relax, and we'll begin.
AID00109181	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
AID00109182	I'm afraid protocol prevents me from treating you then.
AID00109183	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.

AID00109222	You want to play tough gal, that's no skin off my nose.
AID00109223	Not my clinical opinion, but so be it.

AID00109225	All right, fix me.
AID00109226	All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!

AID00109295	I don't know him very well.
AID00109296	You're Freddie's mom, right?
AID00109297	You're a runaway. I had to tell Sister about you.
AID00109298	You're on your own. I'm not getting involved.
AID00109299	Here's 25 caps. Maybe you can buy yourself a gun.
AID00109300	Let me think about it.
AID00109301	Don't worry. I would never turn in a runaway slave.
AID00109302	So you're an escaped slave? Now I understand...
AID00109303	What is this I hear about the Hangar Deck and Upper Deck?
AID00109304	Are you from Rivet City? You don't act like the rest of them.

AID00109354	You should be nervous. Who says that I'm not here to kill you all?
AID00109355	There's no need to be nervous. You can trust me.
AID00109356	Good. Your fear... pleases me.
AID00109357	Understandable. I've met a lot of dangerous people myself.
AID00109358	The honor is all mine, Squire.
AID00109359	You seem nervous, kid. Do I make you nervous?
AID00109360	Relax, Squire. I don't bite.

AID00109365	This is starting to sound risky, but I'll do anything to find my dad.
AID00109366	MQ01ThreeDogTask
AID00109367	I don't like the sound of this at all.
AID00109368	I see where this is going.
AID00109369	This is all a bit much for me. Let me get back to you.
AID00109370	To find my Dad, I'm ready for anything.
AID00109371	There's got to be more you can tell me!
AID00109372	Thanks, Three Dog. That makes me feel a bit better.
AID00109373	I suppose. What is it you needed?
AID00109374	I don't give a shit about you or this station. Just tell me about my Dad.
AID00109375	I don't have time for this crap. Tell me everything about my Dad, right now...
AID00109376	Just wipe that stupid look off your face and answer my questions!
AID00109377	What could I ever do for you? You seem to have everything you need here.
AID00109378	If you know anything that can help me find my Dad, please just tell me...
AID00109379	You don't seem like you have much to offer if you spend all your time up here.
AID00109380	Wait, why do you trust me so easily? I've never met you before.
AID00109381	I don't have time for small talk. I need to find my Dad.
AID00109382	You know my father? Is he here? Please, I've been looking for him!
AID00109383	Nothing. Just wishing me a happy birthday.
AID00109384	Well, yeah! Where's my Dad gone?
AID00109385	Then Rivet City is where I'm headed. Goodbye, Three Dog.
AID00109386	Rivet City? Where's that?
AID00109387	Yeah, yeah. It was the thrill of a freakin' lifetime.
AID00109388	Thanks, Three Dog. I was just glad to help with the Good Fight.
AID00109389	Feral Ghouls?
AID00109390	What's the underground route?
AID00109391	Okay, I'm off.
AID00109392	Where's the Washington Monument?
AID00109393	What's the best way to get to the Museum?
AID00109394	So, what's your story?
AID00109395	Do you know anything helpful about the Museum of Technology?
AID00109396	Galaxy News Radio, huh? What's it all about?
AID00109397	Tell me more about this relay.

AID00109463	Not interested. I'm just here to do some shopping.
AID00109464	Sorry, I must have you confused with somebody else. Forget I mentioned it.
AID00109465	Maybe 100 caps will jog your memory?
AID00109466	Let's just say it's in your best interest to tell me what I want to know.
AID00109467	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction and mind wipe you did for the Android.
AID00109468	Hah! I never mentioned an android. Now I know you did it!
AID00109469	You'll find it much harder to practice medicine with two broken arms. Talk!
AID00109470	He's in danger. Someone from the Commonwealth is looking for him.
AID00109471	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction procedure you performed.
AID00109472	So... Any suggestions for finding this android?
AID00109473	I've found your android. It's Harkness, Rivet City's security chief!
AID00109474	I'm still looking, don't worry. I'll find him.

AID00109491	Sorry, I'm not here to rescue you. In fact, I've got to get going.
AID00109492	What makes you think I'm here to rescue you?
AID00109493	Hold on, short stuff. Who are you and what are you doing here?
AID00109494	Mock you? I'd rather kill you.
AID00109495	All right then, let's go.
AID00109496	Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
AID00109497	No, I just wanted to look at it.
AID00109498	Yeah, it's jammed good. I can't help you.
AID00109499	Don't worry about it. Just keep your head down and let's get out of here.
AID00109500	Your gun is jammed? Can I take a look at it?
AID00109501	So, you're a representative of the mighty Brotherhood? Please.
AID00109502	Calm down. I'm here to help.
AID00109503	I can't help you.
AID00109504	I've heard enough. Let's go get your man.
AID00109505	What's in it for me?
AID00109506	What sort of exercise were you doing out here?
AID00109507	Is the initiate still alive?
AID00109508	I'm sorry, I can't help you.
AID00109509	Fuck off, boy scout. I'm not here to help you.
AID00109510	What's happening here?
AID00109511	Have you seen C.J. Young lately?
AID00109512	This is your mess, kid. Get yourself out of it.
AID00109513	Sure, kid. Sorry I said those things. Let's get you home.
AID00109514	Ooh! That hurt! Do us all a favor and just run away from home.
AID00109515	Hey, I didn't mean to upset you...
AID00109516	Your mother's a bitch and you're a spoiled little punk.
AID00109517	I've met your mother. No wonder you're such a brat.
AID00109518	I don't think so. I've got questions.
AID00109519	What are you so upset about?
AID00109520	What do you mean, my Dad is "gone"?
AID00109521	Leave me alone. I'm trying to get some sleep.
AID00109522	How weird. I was just dreaming about you...
AID00109523	Huh? What's wrong, Amata?
AID00109524	MS08HarknessProof2
AID00109525	Proof
AID00109526	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the truth!
AID00109527	I know you don't believe me, but I'm telling the truth!
AID00109528	It's your decision. I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
AID00109529	You're more than "just a machine." You're a person, Harkness. You belong here.
AID00109530	People will kill you when they find out. The Commonwealth is where you belong.
AID00109531	Zimmer's waiting. He'll want to take you home now.
AID00109532	Don't worry, Harkness. Your secret is safe with me.
AID00109533	Is violence really necessary? Can't you just... kick him off the boat?
AID00109534	Sometimes you have to kill the bad guys.
AID00109535	Actually, I was hoping you'd let me kill him.
AID00109536	What are you going to do about Zimmer? He's the one you were running away from.
AID00109537	I can see you aren't going to believe me. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
AID00109538	You're a robot from the Commonwealth. You belong to a man named Zimmer.
AID00109539	Those memories of your wife aren't real. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
AID00109540	We need to talk.
AID00109541	I'm being completely serious. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
AID00109542	I don't suppose you know that you're a robot, do you?
AID00109543	This isn't an existential debate. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
AID00109544	I'm not sure how to put this... You're not who you think you are.
AID00109545	Look, I know he's in here. I mean, in the Vault.
AID00109546	He's an older guy, around 50 or so.
AID00109547	He's a scientist. He's looking for Doctor Braun.
AID00109548	What the hell's going on here?
AID00109549	No thanks. No games for me.
AID00109550	A game? Okay, I guess...
AID00109551	What? I don't live here.
AID00109552	Is this some kind of a game?
AID00109553	I'm looking for my father. Have you seen him?
AID00109554	How do you know who I am?
AID00109555	You've seen my father? Where is he?
AID00109556	Who is Betty?
AID00109557	And you are...?
AID00109558	Where am I?
AID00109559	I'm trying to convince Harkness he's an android, but he wants proof.
AID00109560	RCPackageEnd
AID00109561	Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
AID00109562	Look, kid. I'm not interested in playing games.
AID00109563	They've never loved you. In fact, they both hate you and wish you were dead.
AID00109564	They know what you did, and they're leaving you here all alone.
AID00109565	Sorry, Timmy. I just thought you should know.
AID00109566	Hey, I heard your parents are getting a divorce because of you.
AID00109567	What kind of a game is this?
AID00109568	That's it? I can do that.
AID00109569	What? That's crazy!
AID00109570	What's the Brotherhood doing here?
AID00109571	"Free voice of the people"? What does that mean?
AID00109572	I need to speak to Three Dog.
AID00109573	What's this building for?

AID00109596	Big deal. Your dad's mad at my dad. What's that got to do with me?
AID00109597	Good for Dad. About time someone stood up to the Overseer. No offense.
AID00109598	I'm not afraid of your father's thugs. You should know that by now.

AID00109612	Oh my God... Are you okay?
AID00109613	So I guess maybe it is time to get moving.
AID00109614	I'm listening now. What's happened to Jonas?

AID00109620	I'm not sure that I can handle this, Three Dog.
AID00109621	All right. How can I help?
AID00109622	Super Mutants? Blowing things up? This sounds out of my league.

AID00109672	You're the Overseer's daughter! Can't you fix this?
AID00109673	Fine. Escape first, payback later.
AID00109674	I've heard enough. I'm going to make them pay.
AID00109675	You're right. I can't stay here. But where can I go?
AID00109676	If you want me to find Ian, I'll need to equip myself. That costs money.
AID00109677	Sorry. I agreed to go to Arefu. That's it.
AID00109678	All right, Lucy. Calm down. I'll find Ian.
AID00109679	There's no sign of him, but I'm sure he's alive.
AID00109680	Ha! That's it? No problem.
AID00109681	No, I won't do that to them.
AID00109682	Fine, but it's only because I want more answers from you.
AID00109683	Hey, maybe you should mind your own business.
AID00109684	Hey, thanks for the tip.
AID00109685	So they've had some problems in the past?
AID00109686	What do you mean, "worked everything out"?
AID00109687	Betty wants me to break up your marriage.
AID00109688	Oh, come on. You know something, don't you? What's the story?
AID00109689	Okay, if you say so.
AID00109690	My Dad can't have really left the vault. That's impossible.
AID00109691	Spill it, Amata. How do I get to the exit?
AID00109692	Wait... If the door to the exit is sealed, how am I supposed to get out?
AID00109693	Nothing. I just wanted to see if you were still waiting for me to come back.
AID00109694	I may have been a little hasty earlier. I'm ready to hear your plan.
AID00109695	I was wrong. I'm sorry. I do need your help.
AID00109696	Lights out? Radroaches? Maybe you'd better tell me more about what's going on.
AID00109697	Whatever. In any case, I don't need any more of your "help."
AID00109698	Sorry, Amata. I do trust you. It's just a lot to take in.
AID00109699	Dad didn't need your help, and neither do I.
AID00109700	Well, when you put it that way... maybe I could use your help.
AID00109701	I don't need help from anyone. Especially not from the Overseer's daughter.
AID00109702	Not another one of your "plans," Amata...
AID00109703	You're right. It's none of your business.
AID00109704	Of course he did! My dad tells me everything. <Lie.>
AID00109705	No, I had no idea he was planning to leave.
AID00109706	I just have to break into the most heavily guarded place in the Vault? That it?
AID00109707	So while I'm doing all this breaking and entering, you're helping me... how?
AID00109708	Secret tunnel... sounds promising. But how do I get into the Overseer's office?
AID00109709	Sure am. Stopped in to find something to do.
AID00109710	No. I said I wouldn't do it, and I meant it.

AID00109750	That's awful! How could the Brotherhood do that?
AID00109751	What happened to the other kids from the Pitt?
AID00109752	What happened to your parents?
AID00109753	How did you end up back here?
AID00109754	That was before I knew how boring it was.
AID00109755	Yeah, I did. I'm sorry, go on...
AID00109756	Huh? I'm sorry, are you still talking?
AID00109757	What made them so terrible?
AID00109758	How did you escape?
AID00109759	I'm looking for runaway slaves.
AID00109760	Sounds like a nice place. You should go back.

AID00109766	Actually, let me think about it.
AID00109767	Sure, 200 caps sounds good.
AID00109768	Some culture would be good for you, Ghoul.
AID00109769	You'd be the only one in the entire world to have this...

AID00109776	I hate to break it to you, but I saw your husband kissing some other woman.
AID00109777	What is that stone head?
AID00109778	I'll bet you know where I can find one.
AID00109779	Where the hell am I supposed to get a picture of the Memorial?
AID00109780	Yeah... that's a problem. Well, I'd better get going.
AID00109781	Hannibal says you need something?
AID00109782	Sounds dangerous. Where is this place?
AID00109783	That's a noble cause, but can I ask you about something else?
AID00109784	Is this going to be a long story? 'Cause I've got things to do...
AID00109785	Why don't you let them stay here?
AID00109786	What are a bunch of escaped slaves doing holed up here?
AID00109787	I could get rid of the Super Mutants, if there are any.
AID00109788	I'll need to think about that.
AID00109789	Protect escaped slaves? You've got to be kidding. You're worth money to me!

AID00109795	What happened to you and the rest of the Rangers?

AID00109809	I still don't understand how my father escaped. Isn't the Vault door sealed?
AID00109810	So what happened to the lights?

AID00109865	My mistake. I'll just be going.
AID00109866	I'm just looking for a place to rest, and maybe do some trading.
AID00109867	Maybe. How much is it worth to find these slaves for you?
AID00109868	They're up north, near Old Olney.
AID00109869	If I had, I wouldn't tell you.
AID00109870	I haven't seen any slaves recently.
AID00109871	Not around here, but there is a group of them up north near Old Olney.
AID00109872	So I'm a prisoner? I don't think so!
AID00109873	I've got no beef with you. Let me go and I won't say a word.

AID00109879	What do you have against these guys?

AID00109885	Hey, she's my girl! Take a number!
AID00109886	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?

AID00109893	It's a deal.
AID00109894	How much will you pay for this poster of the Lincoln Memorial?
AID00109895	Are you interested in buying a recording of Lincoln's voice?
AID00109896	Would you like to make an offer on Lincoln's Rifle?
AID00109897	I've found Hannibal Hamlin.
AID00109898	If I find them, you'll be the first to know.
AID00109899	Actually, I already know he's up north, near Old Olney.

AID00109913	Never heard of it. Is it a ruin around here?
AID00109914	So if I find anything like that, you might buy it from me?
AID00109915	Actually, I can leave her for the Radroaches. Just watch me.
AID00109916	Why do you need my help, anyway? Afraid of a few Radroaches?
AID00109917	All right. I'll help. But I'm doing this for your mom, not for you.

AID00109986	Who is it you keep referring to as "Him"?

AID00109989	This place is weird. Where do you plug stuff in?
AID00109990	I've never seen anyplace like this.
AID00109991	Maybe it's his. You know, for him to wear when no one is looking...
AID00109992	Well, then I guess he's cheating on you.
AID00109993	It looks like Roger is a fan of women's clothing.
AID00109994	Just trust me. It's important.
AID00109995	Nothing. Never mind.

AID00110028	Okay already. Let's get this going.
AID00110029	And where can I find this person?
AID00110030	I would be honored to meet this person.
AID00110031	Fine, fine. Get to the point already.
AID00110032	Which brings us to why I'm here, I suppose.
AID00110033	Yeah, sure. I guess that's why Maple stuck a rifle in my face...
AID00110034	Shun technology? How do you defend yourselves?
AID00110035	If you hate technology, why carry weapons?
AID00110036	Forget this whole thing. This is insane!

AID00110045	Sorry, I don't think I can help you.
AID00110046	All right. I'll do it.
AID00110047	What's in it for me if I risk my neck for you?
AID00110048	I don't know, Reilly. This sounds like suicide.
AID00110049	So that leaves them up there. How come you're here?
AID00110050	Hang on, I'll be back
AID00110051	What did you need from me?
AID00110052	Look, I could care less about your stories.
AID00110053	Last stand?
AID00110054	Trapped yourself at the top of a tall building. Brilliant.
AID00110055	Bad move, I'm guessing.
AID00110056	Not a very smart move, if you ask me.
AID00110057	Let me guess, more Super Mutants inside?
AID00110058	So, what's this about needing help? Tell me the whole story.
AID00110059	I'd really like to speak to this woman. Please, wake her now.
AID00110060	Do you mind if I try and revive her?
AID00110061	Do you think there's any way to revive her?
AID00110062	How did she end up in the Chop Shop?
AID00110063	What's wrong with her?
AID00110064	Reilly's Rangers?
AID00110065	MS07UnityRequest2B
AID00110066	MS07UnityRequest2A
AID00110067	I can help you defend yourselves.
AID00110068	If you can arm yourselves, I can teach you how to shoot.
AID00110069	I'll teach you how to sneak and hide. They'll think you've deserted the town.
AID00110070	You should have some robot defenders. I can show you what to do with them.
AID00110071	You could set up a minefield to keep Super Mutants from just strolling in.
AID00110072	I'll stick around to kill the Super Mutants. They should leave you alone after that.
AID00110073	Law of the Wasteland: Survival of the fittest. You're on your own. Good luck!
AID00110074	I can help you defend against the Super Mutants, but it will cost you.
AID00110075	MS07UnityRequest
AID00110076	MS07Unity2B
AID00110077	Yeah, she's fine. They patched her up and she's resting in Underworld.
AID00110078	No time for chatter. I'm here to get you guys out.
AID00110079	I'm afraid this is it.
AID00110080	Where is Theo's body?
AID00110081	How do I know they're still alive?
AID00110082	Any good news about the area?
AID00110083	How can I get there from Underworld?
AID00110084	Tell me more about Reilly's Rangers.
AID00110085	Can you think of anything that will help me get there?
AID00110086	What can you tell me about Vernon Square?
AID00110087	MS14DukovYell
AID00110088	I'm a little short on caps right now.
AID00110089	Can your table handle 200 caps?
AID00110090	You can give me the key, or I can take it. Your choice.
AID00110091	I don't think I need to hear any more.
AID00110092	I've heard enough for now.
AID00110093	Actually, Crowley is alive. He wants some sort of security key you have.
AID00110094	Crowley is alive, and he paid me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
AID00110095	I've learned what I came for. Thank you.
AID00110096	Where did he die?
AID00110097	I'll give you 25 caps for that key.
AID00110098	Give me that key. I'd hate to see you bleed to death.
AID00110099	Thanks for the info. I'm just trying to sort all of this out.
AID00110100	Mister Crowley wants your father's security key.
AID00110101	Do you know what they were doing at the fort?
AID00110102	Can you think of any reason he might want you dead?
AID00110103	Sounds like a normal guy.
AID00110104	Oh look! I dropped these 50 caps in your pocket...
AID00110105	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so. <Lie.>
AID00110106	What can you tell me about Mister Crowley?
AID00110107	Sure. People like that don't deserve to live.
AID00110108	I don't like where this is headed.
AID00110109	Not for the right cause.
AID00110110	Um... I should go.
AID00110111	Okay. What's the plan?
AID00110112	So what can you tell me about Underworld?
AID00110113	All true, except for the part about the mutants, the water and the whore.
AID00110114	Milk sucking? You shuffle stepping, brain eating, grave loving zombie!
AID00110115	Hey! I'm just looking to trade a drink for some gossip.
AID00110116	Easy now. I've got nothing against Ghouls.
AID00110117	Fucking brain eater!
AID00110118	Let me ask you something else.
AID00110119	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
AID00110120	This place looks like a ghost town.
AID00110121	Where did you people come from, anyway?
AID00110122	Whoa, take it easy. I was just asking.
AID00110123	I'm just saying, it's an option.
AID00110124	You let a dying man use supplies you need? You're a bunch of morons.
AID00110125	Let's talk about something else.
AID00110126	Why keep him alive? Don't you need the supplies you're using on him?
AID00110127	Maybe I can help him.
AID00110128	Who's that guy in the clinic?
AID00110129	What can you tell me about Bigtown?
AID00110130	MS07UnityReject
AID00110131	I have a Fission Battery that will fix that express elevator.
AID00110132	Why don't one of you come with me?
AID00110133	Okay, I'll go back and look for the Fission Battery.
AID00110134	Guess what? You're in luck. I have the power cell.
AID00110135	Are there any other ways off this roof?
AID00110136	Doesn't look like the elevator works anymore.
AID00110137	Okay, fine. Yes, she's alive. She's safe in Underworld. Satisfied?
AID00110138	We'll chat about stuff later. We have to get out of here, right now!
AID00110139	Who put you in charge?
AID00110140	Any clue where I can find a Fission Battery?
AID00110141	How have you guys survived up here?
AID00110142	Who are those girls? And where are their clothes?
AID00110143	Not yet, but I'm working on it.
AID00110144	Allistair Tenpenny is dead. One shot, right through the brain.
AID00110145	I've reconsidered your offer. I'll kill those Ghoul-hating bigots for you.
AID00110146	TranqLaneTalk1

AID00110150	TranqLaneTalk5
AID00110151	But you could leave the Vault, find somewhere else to live.
AID00110152	But these people... They don't deserve to be punished.
AID00110153	Why are you doing all of this?
AID00110154	Here, I brought you some ammo.
AID00110155	Well, since I saved your ass, shouldn't you be joining me?
AID00110156	That would be great. Maybe I'll speak to Reilly about it.
AID00110157	Nah. I've got things to do. But thanks for the compliment.
AID00110158	Wow, you're certifiably insane, huh?
AID00110159	Has anyone ever spoken to you about anger management?
AID00110160	Yeah, Brick... You really, um, ventilated them...
AID00110161	My Dad can't have left. The door is sealed shut.
AID00110162	My Dad can't have really left the Vault. That's impossible.
AID00110163	Dad couldn't have really left the Vault! That's impossible...
AID00110164	What? Jonas is dead? What the hell is going on?
AID00110165	Dad couldn't have really left the Vault! That's impossible...
AID00110166	Awwww, isn't that a shame? My heart's bleeding. Really.
AID00110167	Sure did. And now you're all alone.
AID00110168	I didn't know. I didn't mean to do that!
AID00110169	You'll just reset everything anyway. Who cares?
AID00110170	If you had let me see my father, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
AID00110171	Looks like you're stuck here all alone. How does that feel?
AID00110172	I put these people out of their misery. You're getting exactly what you deserve.
AID00110173	There's a pack of Feral Ghouls in the courtyard!
AID00110174	I want more than that to spare your miserable life. 300 caps.
AID00110175	I think it would be better for everyone if I just killed you.
AID00110176	200 caps to spare your life? Okay.
AID00110177	You've satisfied my curiosity.
AID00110178	How did he die?
AID00110179	Mister Crowley is alive. I'm here to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
AID00110180	No way. I'm going to keep those keys for myself.
AID00110181	More caps? You've got a deal.
AID00110182	Those people you sent me to kill aren't Ghoul haters...
AID00110183	The day isn't complete until I've killed something.
AID00110184	Um... I don't think so. I'll stay out here.
AID00110185	I think I'd like to meet Dave.
AID00110186	I'm just a wanderer. I'll be going now.
AID00110187	Your Republic is forfeit. Prepare to be reclaimed by the Wasteland!
AID00110188	I'm not here to hurt anyone. What is this place?
AID00110189	A gift of the key would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mister President.
AID00110190	Not good enough, Mister President.
AID00110191	How did Mister Crowley die, Mister President?
AID00110192	Mister Crowley is alive. He sent me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
AID00110193	Crowley is alive, Mister President. I'm supposed to bring him the key.
AID00110194	What happened in the Fort, Mister President?
AID00110195	Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Mister President.
AID00110196	I seek citizenship in the Republic of Dave.
AID00110197	I am seeking asylum, Mister President.
AID00110198	I'm just a traveler. I guess you could say I'm vacationing.
AID00110199	Most exalted President Dave, I am an ambassador from the Wasteland.
AID00110200	Sounds simple enough.
AID00110201	CG00MomSpeech
AID00110202	Hey, what about my damn reward?
AID00110203	What about my reward?
AID00110204	Yeah, please. I have much to do.
AID00110205	No, please continue... Your men are more important than my reward.
AID00110206	I'm sorry Reilly... None of them made it. I did the best I could.
AID00110207	I'm sorry we lost Butcher and Donavan.
AID00110208	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Donavan.
AID00110209	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Butcher.
AID00110210	I'm sorry we lost Donovan.
AID00110211	I'm sorry we lost Butcher.
AID00110212	I'm sorry we lost Brick.
AID00110213	It went extremely well, as you can see. We didn't lose anyone.
AID00110214	Yeah. That was a tough run.
AID00110215	Nah. It was all in a day's work.
AID00110216	CherryQuit
AID00110217	No. It's going to be a while before I go to Rivet City.
AID00110218	Rivet City it is.
AID00110219	If he's that bad, come with me. I'll protect you.
AID00110220	Thanks for the warning.
AID00110221	Does he pay you for this?
AID00110222	Why aren't you dressed?
AID00110223	So what's the deal with Dukov?
AID00110224	Let these people go. There's no reason to keep them here.
AID00110225	You don't need to stay here. You can live in the real world again.
AID00110226	Why haven't you left after all this time?
AID00110227	How do I know you're not lying to me? Maybe you haven't seen him at all.
AID00110228	Enough games! Take me to him now!
AID00110229	I want to see him. Where is he?

AID00110234	Oh, great. I'm really looking forward to doing more for your amusement.
AID00110235	It's about time! What do I get to do?
AID00110236	I've been bit too busy for that.
AID00110237	Well, I've got the food. But no luck with the medicine.
AID00110238	It wasn't easy, but I got the food and the medicine.
AID00110239	Sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to help!
AID00110240	I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Sorry.
AID00110241	Hold on. I need to know more before I agree to anything.

AID00110270	You want a fucking resume? Just tell me what to do, asshole.

AID00110288	What do I do once I trip the fire control console?
AID00110289	Where can I find the fire control console?
AID00110290	Do you know what the G.E.C.K. does?
AID00110291	If you've been here as long as I imagine maybe you can help me.
AID00110292	Okay, Fawkes. You've got a deal.
AID00110293	How do I know you won't run the second I get you out?
AID00110294	How do I get you out?
AID00110295	I'm not worried. I can mow down whatever's in my way.
AID00110296	Why would I have difficulty getting the G.E.C.K.?
AID00110297	How about you tell me all you know and I don't paint the wall with your brains?
AID00110298	Good, tell me everything you know about it, then!
AID00110299	Why would you help me?
AID00110300	Sorry, I have to get going. I don't have time for this.
AID00110301	The G.E.C.K.? Never heard of it. <Lie.>
AID00110302	What do you know about the G.E.C.K.?
AID00110303	I wish I could stay and chat, but I need to find something important.
AID00110304	How come they've kept you alive?
AID00110305	Why have you been imprisoned?
AID00110306	Sorry, I have more important things to do.
AID00110307	That's quite an unusual name.
AID00110308	It's amazing how well you can speak.
AID00110309	You're kind of weirding me out. I've got to go.
AID00110310	A friendly Super Mutant. Well, now I've seen everything.
AID00110311	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
AID00110312	Yes, I'm human. But what are you?

AID00110321	I wanted to ask about the Holotags.
AID00110322	I had a few questions about them.
AID00110323	I've found some Holotags.
AID00110324	Let's talk about something else.
AID00110325	What's my reward if I bring you these Holotags?
AID00110326	Why can't you send your own people to find the Holotags?
AID00110327	Where can I find Holotags?
AID00110328	What are the Scrolls that you mentioned?
AID00110329	<Yawn.>
AID00110330	You can't keep track of your own damn soldiers? Who runs this place?
AID00110331	And without radio equipment, you can't keep track of them?
AID00110332	Frankly, I don't give a damn.
AID00110333	How about we skip the story and you just tell me what you want.
AID00110334	Sure, I've got all the time in the world.
AID00110335	All right then.
AID00110336	Where can I find Scribe Jameson?
AID00110337	I'll escape without your help, then. I'm not the one who started killing people.
AID00110338	Amata trusts me. If you don't give me what I want, I'll hurt her. Bad.
AID00110339	You're right. You will die if you don't give me that password.
AID00110340	I'm here to kill you. Jonas was my friend.
AID00110341	If you ever lay a hand on Amata again, I'll make you regret it.
AID00110342	Just give me the keys to your office and your password. Then I'll be going.

AID00110347	I don't know, Sarah. I'm not so sure about this.
AID00110348	Of course I can.
AID00110349	Yes, I did. And you're going to die for it.
AID00110350	Nope. Not at all.
AID00110351	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies down there.
AID00110352	Seriously, you're talking about eating people, here. What's wrong with you?
AID00110353	I can't believe I'm being called a potty mouth by a cannibal...
AID00110354	Huh. Well, everyone's got to survive in their own way, I guess.
AID00110355	Wait... are you saying you eat those people?
AID00110356	Bring home the bacon? Those are people, not bacon! What the fuck?
AID00110357	Yes, I was in the basement.
AID00110358	I almost grabbed a snack while I was there, but that would have been rude.
AID00110359	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding down there, you sick bastard!
AID00110360	I really don't know what you're talking about, Jack...

AID00110382	You've convinced me. Hand over your keys and password, and I'll be on my way.
AID00110383	I'm afraid the Vault will just have to get along without you. Time to die.
AID00110384	All right. We'll do it your way. I surrender. <Give him your weapons.>
AID00110385	My father's no traitor. But you're a murderer and a thug.

AID00110392	No, I mean, really close.
AID00110393	The families around here seem very close.
AID00110394	It's true. And they smell funny.
AID00110395	Wait... He's your dad?
AID00110396	I was just joking. It's a lovely place.
AID00110397	Actually, I guess it isn't so bad.
AID00110398	I'm from an underground Vault, lady. Trust me, this place sucks.
AID00110399	I think "weird as all hell" is probably the best way to describe it.
AID00110400	A couple? Is that what you mean?
AID00110401	I'm sure you two will be great together.
AID00110402	Okay, this is boring.
AID00110403	Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.
AID00110404	I don't know, he doesn't seem very smart to me.
AID00110405	I really don't care.
AID00110406	I really don't know.
AID00110407	Well, okay then. Nothing to worry about.
AID00110408	He said you were all crazy killers.
AID00110409	What's wrong with that Harris guy?
AID00110410	Shhh.... time for a nap, gramps.
AID00110411	Well, I'll be careful, I guess.
AID00110412	You're right. I hate friendly people.
AID00110413	Well... okay... whatever works for you.
AID00110414	What's wrong with being friendly?
AID00110415	You know, there is something a bit "off" about them...
AID00110416	Yeah... you go get some sleep, crazy old man. I'll be going now...
AID00110417	I don't know, it seems like a pretty nice place to me.
AID00110418	Whoa, slow down, grandpa. What's wrong?
AID00110419	What, what?
AID00110420	This dump? Are you serious?
AID00110421	Well, I can certainly see why.
AID00110422	Best town in the USA? How many towns compete in that contest?
AID00110423	Yeah... maybe not. I don't want to catch whatever you have.
AID00110424	Thanks, Jack. Maybe I'll do that.
AID00110425	Ah, I get it! You're crazy.
AID00110426	Well, okay then.
AID00110427	Yeah... you're a little too chipper for my tastes. I'm out of here.
AID00110428	Well, it's good to meet you, Jack.
AID00110429	Virginia? Virginia's been gone for 200 years.
AID00110430	I'm afraid I've lost my Geomapper...
AID00110431	Yeah, my equipment has seen better days.
AID00110432	I have some mapping data for you.
AID00110433	As long as the caps flow, you'll get your maps.
AID00110434	Done deal. I'll locate as many as I can for you.
AID00110435	Well, yeah. I expect to be paid a merc's wage, though.
AID00110436	Sure. Why not. You look like you need the help.
AID00110437	Well, looks like you're on your own then.
AID00110438	Let me help. You stay here and I'll do some mapping for you.
AID00110439	Theo died because he was careless.
AID00110440	No, Theo died because of bad luck. That's all.
AID00110441	Shit happens, Reilly. Get used to it.
AID00110442	We all make mistakes, Reilly. You're not a fortune teller.
AID00110443	What's been happening since you've been back?
AID00110444	Yeah, I think I'm hurt.

AID00110465	What do you mean "fresh human samples"?
AID00110466	It's all here. <Give 100 Caps.>
AID00110467	Here you go. <Give 200 Caps.>
AID00110468	Okay, here are the caps. <Give 300 Caps.>
AID00110469	Hmmm... I don't think so.
AID00110470	I'm injured. Anything you can do for me?
AID00110471	Wait here.
AID00110472	They're worshipping a tree? Ha ha ha!
AID00110473	Okay. What's the trick? I know there's a guy with a microphone somewhere.

AID00110518	Look, I don't want to fight you.
AID00110519	I'm going to enjoy killing you.
AID00110520	Actually, I don't know where they are. But thanks for the caps.
AID00110521	They're just around the corner. You can't miss them.
AID00110522	Yeah, they're hiding right around the corner.
AID00110523	Maybe I have. What's it worth to you?
AID00110524	No, I haven't seen any slaves around here.
AID00110525	I have to be on my way.
AID00110526	Would you mind playing the violin for me?
AID00110527	How are you feeling, Agatha?
AID00110528	Uh, I think I saw them about two miles south of here.
AID00110529	Why don't you just kill yourself?
AID00110530	If I kill you, every Treeminder will come after me.
AID00110531	How would I be able to kill you? You're a tree.
AID00110532	Sure. Where do you want the bullet, head or gut?
AID00110533	Kill you? You can't be serious!
AID00110534	You want me to murder you?
AID00110535	Look, let's cut the bullshit and get to the matter at hand.
AID00110536	So, the Treeminders said you needed my help?
AID00110537	Well, hopefully your troubles will be over. I'm here to help.
AID00110538	A genetic mutation of that magnitude could only be caused by F.E.V.
AID00110539	I still don't understand what the hell you're talking about.
AID00110540	How on Earth did that happen?
AID00110541	How did a tree end up growing out of your head?
AID00110542	What in the hell are you talking about?
AID00110543	I'm beginning to suspect you weren't always this way.
AID00110544	So you're trapped in there, inside this Herbert... I mean Bob... thing?
AID00110545	About that deal we had... Greta is dead, as promised.
AID00110546	You should come with me. I could use a hand.
AID00110547	You're right. That sounds terrible.
AID00110548	Yeah... Killing. Stealing. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
AID00110549	Why can't you do this research yourself?
AID00110550	Why are you doing this? Why give your allegiance to a machine?
AID00110551	Raven Rock is gone. Eden checked out. You've got nothing left.
AID00110552	Eden betrayed you. You see this vial? He trusts me more than he trusts you.
AID00110553	Eden's not the President. He was never elected! Hell, he's not even human...
AID00110554	You have anything for sale?
AID00110555	Actually, never mind. I don't need your help.
AID00110556	Here you go. Let's get out of here.
AID00110557	Thanks, Agatha. It's more than I expected.
AID00110558	No, no, no. You keep it. You may need it!
AID00110559	It better be good. I busted my ass getting that paper.
AID00110560	Sure, I'll take whatever you can afford.
AID00110561	No, no. Having you write it down is reward enough.
AID00110562	I suppose this one is a freebie too, eh?
AID00110563	Let me get back with you on this.
AID00110564	Sure, I'll get the paper for you.
AID00110565	Paper? Why not record it on a holotape?
AID00110566	Music paper? Let me guess... you don't have any.
AID00110567	Then stop whining about it, and do it!
AID00110568	What do you need to get it done?
AID00110569	You aren't going to live forever, you know.
AID00110570	It doesn't matter. Everything gets lost with time.
AID00110571	You should write your music down, to keep it preserved for the future.
AID00110572	I took a little peek at the files in your computer. Tell me about the android.
AID00110573	You know what? Screw this. You're going down.
AID00110574	This isn't the way to do it. More fighting will just make things worse.

AID00110619	It's not a betrayal.  This is a free, um, nation... right?
AID00110620	Is it because you're too stupid to be President?
AID00110621	It could be pretty tough, I guess.
AID00110622	Have you considered running for the presidency?
AID00110623	Can you take me to see Dave?
AID00110624	I have some other questions...
AID00110625	If you'll excuse me a moment, I'll be right back.
AID00110626	I've got to go.
AID00110627	I'd like to throw my hat into the ring and run for the presidency.
AID00110628	Who's running in the election?
AID00110629	Your father was a monarch? You mean like the butterfly?
AID00110630	So, your father was a monarch and you're a president? How does that work?
AID00110631	Yes, absolutely.
AID00110632	I really wouldn't know. I just got here.
AID00110633	I'd say it looks more like a dictatorship.
AID00110634	Sir, I was hoping you would reconsider your decision.
AID00110635	I'm sorry. I'll just be leaving...
AID00110636	I was just looking around.
AID00110637	No, of course not!
AID00110638	I don't consider myself a spy so much as... your assassin.

AID00110648	You don't have the experience for a book like this. You'll be a laughingstock.
AID00110649	Okay, I can tell how much it means to you. Let's get this book finished.
AID00110650	But why try with this book, when you could be helping out in real ways here?
AID00110651	I don't know. Human nature doesn't change like that.
AID00110652	So you're trying to make the world better than it was?
AID00110653	Seriously, don't waste time with this book. Stick to helping the caravans.
AID00110654	I don't know. Those caravans help a lot of people.
AID00110655	Well, I'm proud to be a part of it. You can count on me!
AID00110656	Moira, please don't write the book. It will just turn out badly.
AID00110657	Okay, but it could be bad if the book's misleading. People could get hurt.
AID00110658	I think you're right. Now, let's get back to work on this book!
AID00110659	What do you mean about your other projects? Have there been problems?
AID00110660	Well, it's a big undertaking, and we've got to make sure we do it right.

AID00110662	It's really good of you to try to help people like this.
AID00110663	Do you have any more of those Mirelurk bait grenades?
AID00110664	Nobody talks to me that way.
AID00110665	What am I supposed to do?
AID00110666	You can have it. I don't even like sweetrolls.
AID00110667	Mmmm... It sure was good when I ate it a few minutes ago.
AID00110668	I threw it away. But you're welcome to eat it off the floor if you want.

AID00110670	Go soak your head, Butch. I'm not giving you my sweetroll.
AID00110671	How about we share it? Half for me, half for you. That's fair, right?

AID00110722	Okay. I'll go look for your father.
AID00110723	What happened here?
AID00110724	Where are your parents?
AID00110725	Can you tell me more about the things attacking Grayditch?
AID00110726	All right, I'm sorry. Calm down and tell me what's going on.
AID00110727	Is that a warning, or a threat?

AID00110729	I'd like to help, but I need to know more first.
AID00110730	Okay kid. I'm going to say it once. Stop your whining!
AID00110731	Unless you tell me what the problem is I can't help you.
AID00110732	Hey, hey. Calm down. It's going to be okay. I promise.

AID00110734	Calm down, kid.
AID00110735	Those what? What's the matter?

AID00110738	Do you have any hard evidence of all this?
AID00110739	If that's so, why are you stuck down here?

AID00110741	You were on the City Council? That's hard to believe.
AID00110742	Setting the record straight is exactly my goal.
AID00110743	You should go vote, if you haven't already.

AID00110777	Where can I get a drink around here? You seem like the right person to ask.
AID00110778	I need medical supplies.
AID00110779	Have you ever heard of a guy named Gob?

AID00110781	My part in this is all done. Sorry, kid.
AID00110782	Fine, I'll take care of everything.
AID00110783	Sorry, kid. Your old man is ant food.
AID00110784	Your father's dead.
AID00110785	Bryan, I'm sorry, but your father is dead.
AID00110786	Looks like all the votes are in, Mister President.
AID00110787	MS10MobSayToHarold
AID00110788	Your dad's the Overseer. Can't you talk to him about Butch?
AID00110789	I wouldn't give him what he wanted. He says he's going to make me sorry later.
AID00110790	Don't worry about me. I'm not scared of him.
AID00110791	I don't want to talk about it.
AID00110792	He, um... He made me give him my sweetroll.
AID00110793	He wanted my sweetroll, but I told him off. <Lie.>
AID00110794	It was kind of my fault. You know how easy it is to make Butch mad...
AID00110795	The jerk tried to steal my sweetroll.
AID00110796	He's lucky Gomez stopped the fight before I really hurt him.

AID00110800	Mayor MacCready's the one who sent me to get you.
AID00110801	Nope. Never heard of it.
AID00110802	Yeah, I've heard of it.
AID00110803	Why would I help you? What's in it for me?
AID00110804	Don't worry, I've got a plan.
AID00110805	Get lost, kid.
AID00110806	How can I get you out of here?
AID00110807	I'm with you so far. Keep going.
AID00110808	Skip to the point, short stuff.
AID00110809	I just need to know what to do right now.
AID00110810	Okay, tell me the whole plan. All of it.
AID00110811	That's the best you can come up with? Don't you have any other ideas?
AID00110812	Sure, I'll go do that.
AID00110813	No way. I can't take them all on.
AID00110814	I don't have any water to spare, but I'll be back when I find some.
AID00110815	Then I guess you're done for, because I'm not giving you any.
AID00110816	Sure, I can spare some water. <Give 1 water.>
AID00110817	Where's the terminal I need to use?
AID00110818	I'm not that good with computers...
AID00110819	You should go vote, if you haven't already.
AID00110820	It's none of my business. I'm just passing through.
AID00110821	Listen, for a share of the water I'll help you take out those jokers.
AID00110822	I'm taking the water. All of it. And don't try to stop me.
AID00110823	Why don't we all split it? There's really no point in getting killed for it.

AID00111143	Fine by me.
AID00111144	Sure. Just don't treat me like a pack Brahmin, okay?
AID00111145	Ooo. Got something good for me? Is it a dress?
AID00111146	You're making me carry the heavy stuff, aren't you?
AID00111147	I'm sure you'll be fair and equitable, boss.
AID00111148	I expect to be awed by your dizzying mercantile sense, boss.
AID00111149	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111150	<Storage::Open>
AID00111151	<bark!>
AID00111152	Let's distribute the weight.
AID00111153	Let's deal.
AID00111154	Let's see what you got.
AID00111155	Grandma's got a present for you!
AID00111156	Enough about tactics.
AID00111157	All right.
AID00111158	Yeah. Screw them.
AID00111159	Enough about tactics.
AID00111160	Let me know if you need anything else.
AID00111161	Don't strain yourself, boss.
AID00111162	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111163	<Tactics Interface::Open>
AID00111164	<pant pant>
AID00111165	Fine, let's focus on the bad guys.
AID00111166	Waste of time, anyway.
AID00111167	Fine. All this planning won't matter much when the bullets fly, anyway.
AID00111168	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
AID00111169	That's what I do best.
AID00111170	Keep your distance.
AID00111171	They'll never see the haymakers coming.
AID00111172	Keep your distance.
AID00111173	Wherever you want me. No problem.
AID00111174	You mean like the last time you told me to do that, boss?
AID00111175	Got it. I'll be way back here, boss.
AID00111176	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111177	<Follow Distance::Far>
AID00111178	<bark! bark!>
AID00111179	Like your thinking.
AID00111180	Sweetie, I think  knows a little something about chopping evil people. That's what I've been doing.
AID00111181	All right, dear, grandma will stay out of your way - but I'll be close enough to hear if you call!'
AID00111182	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
AID00111183	Let's go.
AID00111184	Got it.
AID00111185	Good talk.
AID00111186	Right behind you, boss.
AID00111187	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111188	<Control Interface::Close>
AID00111189	<bark!>
AID00111190	Grandma's right behind you, sugar!
AID00111191	Sounds good to me.
AID00111192	All right, enough jabbering.
AID00111193	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
AID00111194	I'm always eager for more of your scintillating conversation, boss.
AID00111195	Okay.
AID00111196	I'm listening.
AID00111197	See? I'm good at stuff.
AID00111198	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111199	<Follow Distance Protocol::Close>
AID00111200	<pant pant>
AID00111201	What now?
AID00111202	Let's hear it.
AID00111203	What can grandma do for her little pumpkin?
AID00111204	Stay close to me.
AID00111205	Any closer and you'd need a Rad-Away, boss.
AID00111206	Okay, I'll keep it tight.
AID00111207	I'm not going to wander off, but okay.
AID00111208	Hey, now. You're gonna have to buy me dinner first.
AID00111209	This is as close as I get until you turn into a leggy brunette.
AID00111210	Sorry. I get distracted. Been scavenging too long.
AID00111211	Oh, I wouldn't dream of getting too far away, boss.
AID00111212	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111213	<Follow Distance::Close>
AID00111214	<bark!>
AID00111215	About as close as I can get without crawling up your ass.
AID00111216	Any closer, I'm stepping in your boots.
AID00111217	Already am... 'less you're getting fresh on me.
AID00111218	Gonna need a wedding ring first.
AID00111219	Sorry, was lagging behind there.
AID00111220	Keep your shirt on, I'm coming.
AID00111221	All right, I'll rein it in.
AID00111222	Bringing up the rear.
AID00111223	If I get any closer, I might squish you! And that would make grandma sad.
AID00111224	Aww, someone misses grandma!
AID00111225	Stick close to me.
AID00111226	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
AID00111227	What, I got whiskey on my breath?
AID00111228	Look, if you ripped one, I don't care.
AID00111229	Washed a hundred times, Brahmin smell never gets out.
AID00111230	Sorry - travelling the Mojave don't exactly leave me smelling like a rose.
AID00111231	Just tell me where you want me.
AID00111232	We can do that.
AID00111233	What are you saying, exactly?
AID00111234	Am I stepping on your shoes or something, boss?
AID00111235	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111236	<Follow Distance Protocol::Open>
AID00111237	<pant pant>
AID00111238	What's the matter, dearie? Afraid grandma will embarass you in front of your little friends?
AID00111239	What's the matter, dearie? Do you miss having grandma close by?
AID00111240	I want you to use ranged weapons.
AID00111241	Yeah, you and me both.
AID00111242	You mean like the one I'm already using, boss?
AID00111243	No arguments from me.
AID00111244	Sure thing, boss.
AID00111245	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111246	<Weapon Type::Ranged>
AID00111247	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111248	<Weapon Type::Ranged>
AID00111249	Does jumping at them with my fists count as ranged? <Sighs> Fine.
AID00111250	Are you talking to me, or a future Veronica who is not already doing that?
AID00111251	[Rex is incapable of ranged attacks and will continue using melee attacks.]
AID00111252	Could use a little target practice.
AID00111253	Music to my ears.
AID00111254	Dad'd approve.
AID00111255	Line the bottles up, I'm ready.
AID00111256	Well, if you insist, but Leo isn't going to like it much.
AID00111257	Now now, dearie, there's no need to repeat yourself. Grandma hears just fine.
AID00111258	Switch to a melee weapon.
AID00111259	Not my strong suit, but okay.
AID00111260	Right. Got it. I'll just stop using this melee weapon and instead use a melee weapon. Good idea, boss.
AID00111261	If you would like me to die very rapidly, this is clearly the best tactical choice.
AID00111262	Sure, I'll stop using my rather effective gun and switch to, ah, this piece of metal tubing here. Great plan, boss.
AID00111263	You mean like this melee weapon right here in my hand at this very second?
AID00111264	Yes! Finally. Everything's coming up Veronica.
AID00111265	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111266	<Weapon Type::Melee>
AID00111267	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111268	<Weapon Type::Melee>
AID00111269	[Rex defaults to melee attacks since he has no ranged weapons.]
AID00111270	All right. <Cracks knuckles>
AID00111271	As long as I'm not bringing a knife to a shootout.
AID00111272	Good, my fists were getting bored.
AID00111273	Gives me a chance to practice my backhand.
AID00111274	Throw some whiskey in the mix, and I'm game.
AID00111275	Time to make some new friends.
AID00111276	Oh dearie me, I thought I already was! Have I been confused all this time?
AID00111277	Oh, I'm so glad, peanut. Leo finds chopping people so much easier.
AID00111278	Let's talk about something else.
AID00111279	No arguing here.
AID00111280	As long as we're not here all day.
AID00111281	Long as it's not a lecture.
AID00111282	I'm listening.
AID00111283	Not a problem.
AID00111284	I'm listening.
AID00111285	Whatever you say, boss.
AID00111286	Yeah. Shake things up a little.
AID00111287	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111288	<Tactics Interface::Close>
AID00111289	<pant pant>
AID00111290	Whatever you like, dearie.
AID00111291	That's all. Let's get going.
AID00111292	Right behind you.
AID00111293	You got it.
AID00111294	After you.
AID00111295	Count me in.
AID00111296	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111297	<Control Interface::Close>
AID00111298	<bark!>
AID00111299	Let's hit the road.
AID00111300	Road's not getting any shorter.
AID00111301	All right, let's get this caravan rolling.
AID00111302	Don't you want to give grandma some sugar first?
AID00111303	I want you to change your combat style.
AID00111304	If you think it'll help.
AID00111305	I'll do my best.
AID00111306	In what way, boss?
AID00111307	My recommendation - more punching.
AID00111308	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111309	<Combat Interface::Open>
AID00111310	<aroo?>
AID00111311	My style suits me just fine. But go ahead anyway.
AID00111312	Well, we all ain't got Pip-VATS on our wrists.
AID00111313	You expecting a fight?
AID00111314	Ohhh, Leo might not like that, but I'll try, sweetheart.
AID00111315	Let's talk about your tactics.
AID00111316	You wanna do something different?
AID00111317	Oh, this should be good. I mean, what's on your mind, boss?
AID00111318	I'll defer to your judgment, naturally.
AID00111319	Am I punching too much? I get carried away.
AID00111320	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111321	<Tactics Interface::Open>
AID00111322	<aroo?>
AID00111323	I'm listening.
AID00111324	Tactics ain't the word I'd use.
AID00111325	So talk then.
AID00111326	Got my attention.
AID00111327	Of course, dearie, I'll do whatever you want. I can't make any promises about Leo, though.
AID00111328	I just wanted to make sure you were still here. Goodbye.
AID00111329	Old war-bots never die! We just rust away.
AID00111330	Not just yet. I wanted to talk to you about something.
AID00111331	No time to dilly-dally, sir! What is it?
AID00111332	Let's get going.
AID00111333	I've got your back.
AID00111334	Right behind you, boss.
AID00111335	Lead the way.
AID00111336	Aw, just when the standing around was getting exciting.
AID00111337	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111338	<Follow Protocol::Reinitiate>
AID00111339	<bark!>
AID00111340	Let's hit the road.
AID00111341	Let's roll out, then.
AID00111342	All right, dearie, let's go.
AID00111343	It's time for us to part ways.
AID00111344	If that's what you think.
AID00111345	I think we should part ways for now, Boone.
AID00111346	Good call! I mean, if that's what you really want, boss.
AID00111347	Raul, I think I need to head on without you.
AID00111348	Why does everyone always say that?
AID00111349	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00111350	<Companion Protocol::Terminate>
AID00111351	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
AID00111352	<whimper>
AID00111353	If you're sure... your loss.
AID00111354	What no music? I'll hold the tears 'til I'm gone.
AID00111355	If you're sure... your loss. Can't say I couldn't use a break from you for a while.
AID00111356	Aww, grandma will miss her little pumpkin! Are you sure?
AID00111357	I think I may have misheard that order.
AID00111358	You're fired, RL-3. Leave immediately.
AID00111359	I think we should travel together.
AID00111360	Huh. Well, let me know when there's room for me.
AID00111361	Let's travel together.
AID00111362	I'm ready when you are.
AID00111363	Let's travel together.
AID00111364	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
AID00111365	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
AID00111366	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
AID00111367	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
AID00111368	There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
AID00111369	I'm just saying that if it were to "fall" into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
AID00111370	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
AID00111371	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
AID00111372	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
AID00111373	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem, we should open an act at the Tops.
AID00111374	Words cannot contain my excitement at the chance to throw myself headlong into danger with you again, boss.
AID00111375	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
AID00111376	Let's go make trouble.
AID00111377	Ooo. Sorry. Don't want to be a third wheel, you know?

AID00111384	Can't be any worse than here.
AID00111385	All right then, let's get the train rolling.
AID00111386	You got one too many by my count.
AID00111387	Not in the mood for a threesome. Today.
AID00111388	What, you teasing me? Lose one, then ask me again.
AID00111389	That'd be lovely, dearie.
AID00111390	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
AID00111391	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an irresponsible officer!
AID00111392	It is a soldier's duty to soldier, not to play hero!
AID00111393	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
AID00111394	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Martial!
AID00111395	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
AID00111396	Sir, I apologize, but a squad is less effective when it is over crowded.
AID00111397	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
AID00111398	Sounds good. Let's get out of here.

AID00111406	I want nothing to do with this.
AID00111407	Sure. Greta is nothing to me. I'll do it.
AID00111408	Why not just have Charon do it?
AID00111409	I've changed my mind.
AID00111410	Couldn't we work out some sort of deal?
AID00111411	I'll give you 5,000 caps for it.
AID00111412	I'll give you 4,000 caps for it.
AID00111413	I'll give you 3,000 caps for it.
AID00111414	I'll give you 2,000 caps for it.
AID00111415	I'll give you 1,000 caps for it.

AID00111420	I'll take the Stimpaks
AID00111421	You wanted me to get some Scrap Metal for you, right?
AID00111422	I've got 25 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
AID00111423	I've got 20 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
AID00111424	I've got 15 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
AID00111425	I've got 10 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
AID00111426	I've got 5 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
AID00111427	Actually, never mind. I don't want to trade any Scrap Metal.
AID00111428	What were you offering to trade?
AID00111429	No, I haven't changed my mind.
AID00111430	Yes, I've changed my mind. I'll bring you some Scrap Metal
AID00111431	I have some scrap metal for you.
AID00111432	Go ahead and yell. I'll kill every last one of you.
AID00111433	You'll be dead long before help gets here.
AID00111434	Heh. I was just kidding. Now, what were you saying about a job?
AID00111435	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and watch you die gasping for air.
AID00111436	What sort of payment are we talking about?
AID00111437	I have a better idea. How about I do nothing and you give me what you have?

AID00111520	Cut the bullshit. He was my father!
AID00111521	What's any of this got to do with me?
AID00111522	Maybe you should have thought of that before you killed my father.
AID00111523	You'd better start making some sense.

AID00111553	He's not human. He assumed control... it was never given to him.
AID00111554	My point is that your government isn't legitimate. You have no right to rule.
AID00111555	Where's your body?
AID00111556	What... what are you?
AID00111557	It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. President.
AID00111558	That's great, but can you make toast?
AID00111559	That's incredible. Who controls you?

AID00111637	Um... Sierra...
AID00111638	Yeah, he sounds great. So, you mentioned a tour or something?
AID00111639	Tell me more about this Ronald guy.
AID00111640	I think you're crazy.
AID00111641	Wow, this conversation is getting boring...
AID00111642	Who's Ronald?
AID00111643	I have to get going now.
AID00111644	Ugh, that sounds really disgusting!
AID00111645	Wait a minute. How many members are in your club?
AID00111646	What kind of stuff do you collect, exactly?
AID00111647	There's a Nuka-Cola Fan Club?
AID00111648	Ugh! I hate Nuka-Cola. That stuff is disgusting.
AID00111649	Nope. I'm not really interested in seeing your collection.
AID00111650	Yes, of course!
AID00111651	Nuka-Cola collection? Wow!
AID00111652	How do I kill you?
AID00111653	So what's your goal? What are you trying to accomplish?
AID00111654	Okay, I think I understand.
AID00111655	So you control this whole place?
AID00111656	Where did you come from?
AID00111657	Can you tell me more about yourself?
AID00111658	Very well. What can I do for you, Mr. President?
AID00111659	I just don't like it.
AID00111660	The taste... I could never get used to it.

AID00111681	What do you know about the Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility?
AID00111682	What do you know about Nuka-Cola Quantum?
AID00111683	Actually, I don't think I'm ready to do this now.
AID00111684	Okay, Sierra. You've got a deal.
AID00111685	Do you even have a clue as to where I can start looking?
AID00111686	I take it this stuff is rare?
AID00111687	So, that's where I come in, I guess.
AID00111688	What's your interest in all this?

AID00111792	If it'll stop the ants from burning down Grayditch, I'm in.
AID00111793	An error? People have died, Lesko!

AID00111842	Can you explain what you mean?
AID00111843	All right, I'll do what I can to help.
AID00111844	Where did this plan of yours come from?
AID00111845	I'd like to ask you a few questions.
AID00111846	Let me think about it.
AID00111847	Yeah, you'll be better off staying at home.
AID00111848	I can't leave you here alone. Let me find you a place to live.
AID00111849	Surely your brilliance has devised a way for the robot to mingle with the Ants?
AID00111850	Nah. Screw it. I'll go elsewhere.
AID00111851	Fine. You've got a deal.
AID00111852	Make that 200 caps and you have yourself a deal.
AID00111853	100 caps? This kid will make you ten times that. 300, and you've got a deal.
AID00111854	Let me think on it for a while.
AID00111855	I think Bryan will love his new home. I'll send him along shortly.
AID00111856	I found an orphaned kid looking for a home. Would you take him in?
AID00111857	I don't have it anymore. <Lie.>
AID00111858	I have it here. Take it.
AID00111859	Eden wanted me to sabotage the project with some kind of virus.
AID00111860	He wants me to add this virus to the purifier. I think you should take it.
AID00111861	I escaped from Raven Rock.
AID00111862	The President let me go.
AID00111863	I don't have to explain anything. I don't answer to you.
AID00111864	The Enclave took the G.E.C.K. They're installing it now.
AID00111865	I don't have the G.E.C.K. anymore.
AID00111866	Well, it's not quite that simple...
AID00111867	There's no time. We have to move now or we'll lose Project Purity.
AID00111868	I was captured by the Enclave.
AID00111869	Well, sort of. I found the G.E.C.K.

AID00111883	You aren't programmed for self-awareness. You said so yourself.

AID00112088	What if he asks someone else to explode the bomb? You should do something.
AID00112089	Burke gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. You want it?
AID00112090	Too many lives are at stake, Burke! I'm going to defuse that bomb.
AID00112091	All right. Say I decide to help you. What's in it for me?
AID00112092	Simms wants me to disarm the bomb...
AID00112093	MS11FinDeliverLetterTopic
AID00112094	Burke, you silly man. You'll pay me 500 extra caps... and like it.
AID00112095	You see, I live here, lover. And surely you wouldn't want to hurt me...
AID00112096	I have a "proposition" of my own. Would you like to hear it, Mister Burke?
AID00112097	If that bomb ever explodes, it would be doing the world a favor...
AID00112098	Whatever. I don't plan on sticking around very long, anyway.
AID00112099	I can see about disarming that bomb for you.
AID00112100	One day, that thing's going to go off. You're living on borrowed time.
AID00112101	Who would build a town around a bomb? That's crazy!
AID00112102	Don't you think someone should disarm that thing?
AID00112103	I'm just messing with you. Relax!
AID00112104	You're dead.
AID00112105	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
AID00112106	I want your hat. What do you think about that?

AID00112117	So, how did you end up here?
AID00112118	What's your opinion of Tree Father Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel?
AID00112119	Where is the entrance to the caves?
AID00112120	Where did the sap come from?
AID00112121	Were you aware that Laurel gave me this Liniment?
AID00112122	Why don't you just travel to Harold's heart on your own?
AID00112123	I'd like to ask about something else.
AID00112124	I have some questions about the task you gave me.
AID00112125	I give up. Just let me know what you want now.
AID00112126	Uh oh... I see where this is going...
AID00112127	How can I possibly help?
AID00112128	This is a waste of my time.
AID00112129	Why don't any of you listen to Harold?
AID00112130	Doesn't anybody care what your god thinks?
AID00112131	Good! Free firewood for all!
AID00112132	Killing him should stop his influence from spreading.
AID00112133	So what can I do to help?
AID00112134	Did you know that crazy tree thing wants me to kill it?
AID00112135	Are you aware that Harold wants to die?
AID00112136	Did you know your god wants me to kill him?
AID00112137	Can we just dispense with all of the religious crap? His name's Harold!
AID00112138	He's not a god, Birch. His name's Harold.
AID00112139	I'm afraid Harold isn't a god. He's just a human that had some bad luck.

AID00112145	This is bullshit! You're blackmailing me!
AID00112146	No way in hell am I getting near a Super Mutant!
AID00112147	No way, I'm not fetching some stupid dish for you.
AID00112148	Let me think about this. I don't know if I'm ready.
AID00112149	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00112150	Again with the damn stories. Just get to the point.
AID00112151	How did you know I was looking for my Dad?
AID00112152	Then Rivet City is where I'm headed. Goodbye, Three Dog.
AID00112153	Rivet City? Where's that?
AID00112154	On second thought, maybe I should contribute. What do you have in mind?
AID00112155	I know he will. He's always talked about doing what's right.
AID00112156	Look, Three Dog. If I find my Dad, maybe he can help with the Good Fight.
AID00112157	Can't you just help me?
AID00112158	All right, all right. Sorry I got so obnoxious.
AID00112159	Beautiful is your brains all over the broadcast booth if you don't cut the crap.
AID00112160	I don't give a shit about your "Good Fight." You going to help me or not?
AID00112161	All right, Three Dog. I understand the
AID00112162	The guys outside are the Brotherhood of Steel? Who are they?
AID00112163	I understand your fight, but I still need to find my Dad.
AID00112164	Words don't kill people. Guns do.
AID00112165	I'm amazed you're still alive.
AID00112166	All right, I'm sorry.
AID00112167	Give me a break. Stop mouthing off and tell me what I need to know.
AID00112168	So you fight the Good Fight with your voice on Galaxy News Radio.
AID00112169	Look, I need to find my Dad. I don't have time for this nonsense.
AID00112170	So, what's this about the Good Fight?
AID00112171	So, people fight back.
AID00112172	You're going to have a "Good Fight" on your hands if you don't help me...
AID00112173	Whatever you want. I'm just looking for my Dad.
AID00112174	The Good Fight? What's that all about?
AID00112175	You have about two seconds to tell me what I want to know...
AID00112176	What's with the flashy introduction?
AID00112177	Let me ask you something else.
AID00112178	What's this book you're working on?
AID00112179	Never mind, you crazy old bastard.
AID00112180	I said: Are you all right?
AID00112181	Are you okay? You seem a little out of it.
AID00112182	What are you looking at?
AID00112183	I've brought some bloodpacks to contribute.
AID00112184	How are things going now?
AID00112185	Ha! Figures a shithole like this would have a local Chem head.
AID00112186	A place like this is probably crawling with junkies, huh?
AID00112187	So you've got someone in town with a drug habit?

AID00112273	I left the Vault to look for him.
AID00112274	This isn't about me. This is about my father. Now where is he?
AID00112275	I'd like to know a bit more about you.

AID00112586	Let me consider your offer.
AID00112587	Sure, that sounds fair.
AID00112588	I have a very unique item for sale, a genuine Stradivarius violin.
AID00112589	So you want me to risk my ass for a violin that's probably rotted away by now?
AID00112590	After 200 years, how can you be certain the violin is in decent shape?
AID00112591	Actually, forget the stories... let's get to the point.
AID00112592	This violin she owned, was it valuable?
AID00112593	Musical talent? Why would they care about that?
AID00112594	This already sounds kind of like a wild goose chase.

AID00112596	You have records from back then?
AID00112597	Look, granny... Talk is cheap, but getting stuff isn't.
AID00112598	I want to help you, but that type of search could cost me greatly.
AID00112599	I guess a homemade violin is never quite in tune...
AID00112600	Wow, Reilly. You look like shit.
AID00112601	There's something about this you're not telling me, isn't there?
AID00112602	Forget it. I may as well shoot myself in the head and save the trouble.
AID00112603	Did you set any kinds of traps or mines?
AID00112604	Oh, not the mighty Reilly's Rangers! Oooh, scary...
AID00112605	I've heard of you guys. You pack some serious firepower.
AID00112606	Let's skip all the story and get to the point. What do you need?
AID00112607	I don't think you're in any condition to be up and about.
AID00112608	Well then, I guess I'll just have to kill you.
AID00112609	Your boss. So you'd better let me past before you get in trouble.
AID00112610	Maybe I can fix the elevator.
AID00112611	Look, let's get out of here and I promise I'll take you to her.
AID00112612	I'll call the shots from here.
AID00112613	Here's some ammo for you.
AID00112614	The shit's about to hit the fan up here, and you're asking questions?
AID00112615	Well, looks like you got yourselves into a mess. Nice work.
AID00112616	A medic, huh? Can you patch me up?
AID00112617	I don't understand. I can't see you.
AID00112618	Is this some kind of a joke?
AID00112619	Well then, where are you? All I see is computers.
AID00112620	If we're meeting face to face, then show yourself. Don't hide behind a monitor.
AID00112621	Sure. You stay here while I get the caps. I'll be right back.
AID00112622	On second thought, you're not worth the caps.
AID00112623	Look, here are the caps. Let's just pretend we never saw each other.
AID00112624	500 caps says you never saw me. Understand?
AID00112625	I'm on my way up to see the President. How about I put in a good word for you?
AID00112626	So that's your story? I can't believe I stood here and listened to it.
AID00112627	Like I said, you were lucky to get away.
AID00112628	Like I said, bad luck for you.
AID00112629	I've had enough of this pointless story. Shut up already.
AID00112630	Do you still have any? I could use some water.
AID00112631	That was a stroke of good luck.
AID00112632	Tell your crazy stories to somehow who cares.
AID00112633	Obviously you got out somehow.
AID00112634	That sounds bad.
AID00112635	You'd rather those Raiders caught you? Maybe you are crazy.
AID00112636	You think being attacked by Raiders is good luck?
AID00112637	Maybe? What do you mean?
AID00112638	Lucky for you that you got away, huh?
AID00112639	Sounds like you've been having some bad luck.
AID00112640	You said "before I became this." What did you mean?

AID00112653	What's that guy's problem?
AID00112654	Why don't you just go over and see what he's yelling about?

AID00112656	I had no idea. This is fascinating.

AID00112672	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
AID00112673	Sure, I guess.
AID00112674	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be shared with the world.
AID00112675	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.

AID00112680	How about a haircut?
AID00112681	You stay away from my hair.
AID00112682	About what? My hair?
AID00112683	I could care less about your problems. I'm out of here.
AID00112684	You'll make due.
AID00112685	What will become of Oasis?
AID00112686	Welcome back to the Wasteland, asshole.
AID00112687	And here I thought you'd be ready to kill me.
AID00112688	I have to say I'm surprised you aren't angrier with me.
AID00112689	How is it you're causing all of these things to grow around you?
AID00112690	Oh, you said violin? I thought you needed something else. Never mind.
AID00112691	Maybe. You gonna give me something for it?
AID00112692	Yes, take this Stradivarius Violin I found in Vault 92.
AID00112693	Tell me about this project you worked on with my father.
AID00112694	Why did my mother die? What happened?
AID00112695	What was my father like back then?

AID00112731	So anyone can live in Megaton?
AID00112732	So it was just a collection of traders in the beginning?
AID00112733	Why did they build the walls?
AID00112734	I had another question about Megaton.
AID00112735	Why build the walls out of some old flying machine?
AID00112736	There are a lot of parts here for just one machine.
AID00112737	So why didn't they move the bomb?
AID00112738	I don't want to talk about Megaton anymore.
AID00112739	Where did everyone else come from?
AID00112740	I think I get the picture.

AID00113015	MS03MoiraGhoul2B
AID00113016	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
AID00113017	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
AID00113018	I have no idea. I wasn't even here. <Lie.>
AID00113019	The bomb in town just blew up! You're lucky to be alive!
AID00113020	If you're in charge, then you can stop the plans of some mad machine.
AID00113021	You know I'm telling the truth. Eden, the Enclave... Both have betrayed you.
AID00113022	But you know he has. He sent me to do a job that you wouldn't.
AID00113023	Yeah, no thanks.
AID00113024	Is that your job? Why do you need me to do it?
AID00113025	What's in it for me?
AID00113026	What do you need me to do?
AID00113027	Yeah... on second thought, never mind.
AID00113028	You talk too much. Cut the chatter and get to the point, would you?
AID00113029	So, do I get to know, or do I have to guess?
AID00113030	Well. Sounds very exciting. I'll let you get back to that.
AID00113031	Is there anyway I could help you?
AID00113032	What is it that you do here, Gallows?
AID00113033	Don't worry. I'm just here to play Republic with you.
AID00113034	I'd like to know more about the Republic.
AID00113035	I am not calling you "Mister President" every time I speak!
AID00113036	Forget it, Dave. I'm not giving you any secrets.
AID00113037	My former nation was a Vault. The only secrets were kept by the Overseer.
AID00113038	RDTopicTruth
AID00113039	I come from the Land of the Mirelurks! They demand you surrender the Republic!
AID00113040	My nation is a helpless, unarmed village to the north. We beg your assistance.
AID00113041	RDTopicSecretsVault101
AID00113042	You could lead the Republic into a new era! The Democracy of Rosie!
AID00113043	Dave is corrupt! The Republic needs a new champion of freedom!
AID00113044	Your wife let me in... something about a catalog?
AID00113045	Never mind.
AID00113046	Sure, yeah. I have your fall catalog.
AID00113047	Huh? What are you talking about? Evan King sent me.
AID00113048	Sorry, my mistake.
AID00113049	I'm from the Family! Let me in!
AID00113050	Evan King sent me. Can I come in?
AID00113051	Lucy, I have bad news. Your parents are dead.
AID00113052	How did you end up leaving Arefu?
AID00113053	How did Vance know you were one of them?
AID00113054	Why did you... do what you did to your own parents?
AID00113055	Pack your shit. We're getting out of this insane asylum!
AID00113056	Yeah, something's wrong. You're all a bunch of murderers.
AID00113057	Then stay. I think you belong here with the Family.
AID00113058	Maybe I can help you.
AID00113059	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet it will change your mind.
AID00113060	Nothing. Sorry, my mistake.
AID00113061	I think you're a bunch of creepy weirdos.

AID00113124	I want to know about the android. Start talking, or start bleeding.

AID00113368	What can you tell me about Doctor Li?
AID00113369	You have quite an unusual name.
AID00113370	This is a huge waste of time.
AID00113371	You belong in that cage, you freak!
AID00113372	Very well. You were saying?
AID00113373	I'm used to your kind being less cordial. My apologies.
AID00113374	Yikes! I'd say whoever beat you with the ugly stick overdid it.
AID00113375	Must not have been too bad. You're still alive, aren't you?
AID00113376	My only concern was getting this door open, and I did it.
AID00113377	I'm sorry, Amata, but I couldn't risk helping you. They would have killed me.

AID00113414	The Temple is in the Lincoln Memorial, near the Washington Monument.
AID00113415	You look a little lost. Do you need directions?
AID00113416	I enjoyed killing him. Now get out of my way.
AID00113417	Your father deserved to die. He was a murderer.
AID00113418	I'm sorry, Amata. But I had no choice.
AID00113419	Yes, I was going to. Still am, if you'll shut up and get out of my way.
AID00113420	I said I didn't need your help to escape. Turns out I was right.

AID00113427	Blow yourself up.
AID00113428	Do whatever you want... I'm out of here.
AID00113429	Keep the Declaration safe... don't let anyone take it.
AID00113430	This is getting ridiculous. Just give me the Declaration, now!
AID00113431	I've got it! We'll kill all of the English scholars!
AID00113432	Anything we can do to pull the wool over their eyes is a blow for freedom!
AID00113433	Just give me the damn Declaration already!
AID00113434	You're a disgrace. I order your immediate dismissal from the Congress!
AID00113435	You can do whatever you like.
AID00113436	I am presenting it to our King in Great Britain.
AID00113437	You were right! I am a Redcoat Spy and the place is surrounded by my army!
AID00113438	Nope, sorry. I've got to have that Declaration at any cost.
AID00113439	This is what's going to happen. You die, I get the Declaration. Understand?
AID00113440	Is there some way we can make a compromise?
AID00113441	You're not even human, you stupid bucket of bolts!
AID00113442	That's quite brave of you. To potentially sacrifice your life over a document.
AID00113443	Just who are you, exactly?
AID00113444	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
AID00113445	Who's stupid enough to shell out a bunch of caps for a scrap of paper?
AID00113446	Hang on, there. You need to tell me who you are before I agree to anything!
AID00113447	I don't have time for this crap.
AID00113448	I'm not looking for anything. I'm just passing through.
AID00113449	Yeah... better than you, deadeye.
AID00113450	What's the history behind the document?
AID00113451	I have a few questions about the Declaration of Independence.
AID00113452	Let me ask you something else.
AID00113453	Let me think about this for a bit, and I'll get back to you.
AID00113454	Slow down there, gramps. What's this reward you're talking about?
AID00113455	What's your point?
AID00113456	It has to be the Declaration of Independence.
AID00113457	What's missing is my ability to stay awake in this snoreatorium.
AID00113458	Oh good, I was looking for some kindling.
AID00113459	I want to help.
AID00113460	Let's get out of here, I don't have all day.
AID00113461	Don't worry about that gun. Take one of mine.
AID00113462	What do you do for fun around here?
AID00113463	I really don't know. I skipped American government class back in the Vault.
AID00113464	Well, they did give us guns and say, "If we fuck up, feel free to take us out."
AID00113465	Do you think people who fought a war with tyrants wanted unquestioning support?
AID00113466	I couldn't possibly care less about governments or presidents.
AID00113467	Are you kidding? It's the duty of a citizen to question his government.
AID00113468	You're right. My country deserves my unthinking and unquestioning support.
AID00113469	That's all I needed to hear.
AID00113470	Who are the Enclave, anyway?
AID00113471	If you've never seen the Enclave, how can you know anything about them?
AID00113472	Why do you support the Enclave?

AID00113728	Where will you go once you have them?
AID00113729	Player agrees to find Stealth Boy stockpile.
AID00113730	What you saying, human?
AID00113731	Sorry, but I've got some bad news for you.
AID00113732	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
AID00113733	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
AID00113734	I'll find the StealthBoy stockpile for you if your kin will leave this place.
AID00113735	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
AID00113736	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
AID00113737	I can find the stockpile of Stealth Boys for you.
AID00113738	What makes you think there are Stealth Boys here?
AID00113739	Which is?
AID00113740	Why can't you just send your men in to kill the ghoul?
AID00113741	DELETE THIS
AID00113742	Player asks why Harland's room can't be searched.
AID00113743	A ghoul. But not squishy like others. This ghoul is tough.
AID00113744	I thought Antler said send my kin into that room, but three died. Ghoul is a crack shot and set traps too.
AID00113745	After, I realize I heard Antler wrong. So I lock the door to keep kin out and wait for Antler to tell me what to do.
AID00113746	Then you come along. Antler says you are solution.
AID00113747	Why can't you search the last room?
AID00113748	Pay attention when I speak! I said ghoul is a crack shot and sets traps!
AID00113749	Too dangerous for us. Okay for you.
AID00113750	Tell me again why you can't search the room?
AID00113751	Player asks how to help.
AID00113752	Good. Antler brought us here for a reason... Why was that, Antler?
AID00113753	Right! A piece of paper. Shipment invoice. Hundreds of Stealth Boys, sent here a long time ago...
AID00113754	But Stealth Boys must be in the one room one we don't search yet - the one we can't search.
AID00113755	Maybe I can help.
AID00113756	Told you already. Antler wants Nightkin to have all the Stealth Boys in the bad room. With the ghoul.
AID00113757	What do you want me to do?
AID00113758	Why did you all come here, in the middle of nowhere?
AID00113759	And who are you, exactly?
AID00113760	Me? I am devoted to Antler. But before Antler? Hmm...
AID00113761	Captain, once. Last name, Davison. First name... don't remember.
AID00113762	I commanded a troop of Nightkin. The Master's elite. A great honor, very proud.
AID00113763	Something happened. We wandered the desert. Life without Master was... hard. The others' minds going strange, going crazy.
AID00113764	But then I found us new master. I find us Antler!
AID00113765	Since then, everything's been going really well.
AID00113766	The Stealth Boys were sent here by mistake, then sent back.
AID00113767	But invoice note said Stealth Boys were here! Why can't that note be true?
AID00113768	What, Antler? ...But human could be lying! Stealing the Stealth Boys for itself!
AID00113769	Oh, Antler... You trust so easy...
AID00113770	Your lucky day, human. Antler believe you. Nightkin will follow the new note to find Stealth Boys. Better be there.
AID00113771	Okay, looks like I'm going to have to kill you.
AID00113772	Never! Antler protects! You feel Antler's horns now!
AID00113773	I'll think about it.
AID00113774	Player says why he or she is here.
AID00113775	A human who is friend to ghouls? Suspicious.
AID00113776	You mean the ones upstairs. Antler used intercom, told them stay put. But they want to come down in basement anyways?
AID00113777	I cannot allow. My kin are... not right in head like I am. They attack you on sight. Ghouls too. They crazy.
AID00113778	Your ghoul friends have to wait until you find what Antler brought us to get.
AID00113779	I came here on behalf of the ghouls upstairs.
AID00113780	No trouble wanted? Too bad. Trouble finds you!
AID00113781	You come here for a reason, human! Antler say so!
AID00113782	You do as Antler says, or you feel Antler's horns!
AID00113783	I just wandered in here, okay? I don't want trouble.
AID00113784	I have to go.
AID00113785	Right the first time, ugly. I've come to kill you.
AID00113786	Never! Antler protects! You feel Antler's horns now!
AID00113787	Tell me a joke.
AID00113788	My humor emitter array requires recharging.
AID00113789	Photons have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic.
AID00113790	The best contraceptive for old people is nudity.
AID00113791	Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and asks, "Does this taste funny to you?"
AID00113792	I once visited a crematorium that gave discounts for burn victims.
AID00113793	I was going to attend the clairvoyants meeting, but it was canceled due to unforeseen events.
AID00113794	It's common knowledge that irradiated cats have 18 half-lives.
AID00113795	Two atoms are in a bar. One says, "I think I lost an electron." The other says, "Are you sure?" to which the other replies, "I'm positive."
AID00113796	A neutron walks into a bar. "How much for a drink here, anyway?"  To which the bartender responds, "For you, no charge."
AID00113797	War does not determine who is right - only who is left.
AID00113798	Thanks, Amata. I'll only use it as a last resort, I promise.
AID00113799	I'd like something to drink.
AID00113800	I'm sorry, sir. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
AID00113801	I'm sorry, madam. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
AID00113802	Certainly, sir. Here you are.
AID00113803	Certainly, madam. Here you are.
AID00113804	I have to go now.
AID00113805	Well, what are you waiting for?
AID00113806	Can't we talk this out?
AID00113807	He needs to talk to someone from the outside, to get some perspective.
AID00113808	PC challenges Chris's ghoulness - merely bald
AID00113809	PC says goodbye
AID00113810	PC asks Chris about his condition
AID00113811	PC says Bright told him to speak to Chris about rockets
AID00113812	PC black widow calls Chris handsome
AID00113813	PC challenges Chris's ghoulness
AID00113814	PC says Chris has smooth skin, too
AID00113815	You're secure in these tunnels. Why try to get into Tenpenny, anyway?
AID00113816	I'll come back later then.
AID00113817	Do you know when I can see Mister Tenpenny?
AID00113818	I'm here to see Tenpenny. But if you weren't so incompetent, you'd know that.
AID00113819	TenpennyGuardPenthouse
AID00113820	I've met them. Roy Phillips and those other Ghouls don't seem all that bad.
AID00113821	I'm here to see Roy Phillips.
AID00113822	I need repairs.

AID00113846	Yeah, let's show them how Kings rumble.
AID00113847	I've got your back.
AID00113848	Sure, boss. You lead the charge, I'll follow as fast as my arthritic, rotting knees can carry me.
AID00113849	You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
AID00113850	Sure thing, boss. You betcha.
AID00113851	Well now, what's all this.
AID00113852	Looks like a party.
AID00113853	Caught me good and pissed.
AID00113854	Don't worry, pumpkin, grandma's here to help!
AID00113855	Grandma's coming, babies!

AID00113942	Look, if you can give me more information or point me in the right direction...

AID00114019	Well, there's t-rex figurines, of course. That's our bread and butter.
AID00114020	We also have an assortment of the REPCONN factory souvenirs - rockets, things of that nature.
AID00114021	Who's No-bark?
AID00114022	Used to be?
AID00114023	Tell me about the rocket factory.
AID00114024	Oh, that? It's just a bit west of Novac, up in the mountains. Lots of broken equipment and such. Place is deserted. Or used to be, I guess.
AID00114025	Lately there's been talk of ghouls up that way, but I can't rightly say whether it's so or not. If you want to know more, ask old No-bark.
AID00114026	Tell me about the rocket souvenirs.
AID00114027	Tell me more about the dinosaur souvenirs.
AID00114028	Tell me more about the souvenir rockets.
AID00114029	They're scale replicas of the real thing. Very detailed. Got a liquid in them that makes them glow.
AID00114030	From what I hear, REPCONN used to give them out on tours of their HQ up in Henderson.
AID00114031	But I guess they had to stop after the first few kids thought they were filled with Nuka Cola and drank it down.
AID00114032	The papers had a name for the condition and everything. They called it the "REPCONN Shakes." Those were bad times for RobCo.
AID00114033	I'd like to see what you've got for sale.
AID00114034	Sure thing. Have a look.
AID00114035	I'd like to buy one of those souvenir rockets.
AID00114036	Really? I mean, that's great! I'm sure you'll be quite pleased with it.

AID00114041	I hope you will come find us there, wanderer! There is much to be done.
AID00114042	The "demons" are gone.
AID00114043	I understand. I know you will fulfill your promise.
AID00114044	I haven't dealt with the "demons" yet.
AID00114045	PC declines to help
AID00114046	But we have no hope of completing the Great Journey without your help!
AID00114047	Sorry. Not interested.
AID00114048	I pray that you will reconsider, wanderer.
AID00114049	Like I said, not interested.
AID00114050	PC agrees to help
AID00114051	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
AID00114052	With the underground rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
AID00114053	I've already killed your "demons."
AID00114054	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
AID00114055	As soon as the underground has been rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
AID00114056	I'll take care of the "demons" for you.
AID00114057	PC says Novac is worried about REPCONN ghouls
AID00114058	And they've been shooting them down like animals, haven't they?
AID00114059	Those ghouls were members of my flock, even after the madness consumed their minds. We never let them wander free.
AID00114060	We kept them safe on the first floor. We kept them contained. The demons must have let them out, somehow...
AID00114061	And now they are lost forever, denied the salvation and healing glow of the Far Beyond...
AID00114062	Please, wanderer, bear in mind that every feral ghoul you spare now is one that we can save later.
AID00114063	Once the way is clear, our feral brothers and sisters will accompany us on the Great Journey. If there are any left...
AID00114064	I'm here because feral ghouls have been wandering into Novac.
AID00114065	PC asks about additional obstacles
AID00114066	PC asks about the Nightkin
AID00114067	The demons appeared from nowhere... except it might be more accurate to say they never actually "appeared" at all.
AID00114068	The demons are invisible. Where one of them stands, the most one sees is the air shimmering, like sunlight on water...
AID00114069	They set upon us as we were on our way to worship one morning. We had just entered the basement.
AID00114070	My flock fought bravely, and killed a few, but at such cost. Nearly half of us died or went missing.
AID00114071	The rest of us retreated up here. One of the demons raved at us, but they have not tried to attack us since.
AID00114072	Still, their demonic presence brought all progress towards the Great Journey to a standstill.
AID00114073	But now you have come. Once again, the creator has sent a human to help us across a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
AID00114074	Tell me more about these "demons."
AID00114075	Yes, over the intercom. Threats of death should we step outside, guarantees of safety should we stay locked away.
AID00114076	It went on for hours, and did not always make sense. But that was the first day only. Since then, silence.
AID00114077	Will you drive away the demons, wanderer?
AID00114078	You say one of the demons "raved" at you?
AID00114079	Yes, wanderer?
AID00114080	About those "demons"...
AID00114081	PC asks what ghouls are doing here
AID00114082	Heard anything interesting?
AID00114083	JasonBrightSpeech4
AID00114084	The Journey ahead would have been impossible if not for the intercession of two human friends, one new, the other a long-abiding companion.
AID00114085	JasonBrightSpeech3
AID00114086	Though it may seem that all humans despise us, the creator has seen fit to instruct us differently.
AID00114087	JasonBrightSpeech2
AID00114088	The almighty creator has seen fit to answer our prayers. The time has come for us to board the rockets and begin the Great Journey.
AID00114089	JasonBrightSpeech1
AID00114090	Gather, all. May the creator guide my words and help me speak true...
AID00114091	I'm not really sure it's safe to carry those things around.
AID00114092	I understand if that's how you feel. But keep in mind that I've been selling these for years and I'm fine.
AID00114093	I'm sure the kids that buy them are all fine too.
AID00114094	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs? It would explain the glow and the illnesses.
AID00114095	[SUCCEEDED] I, ah, well I don't really know. Would that sour you on buying one if it did?
AID00114096	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs?
AID00114097	That price is an insult. You'll have to do better than that.
AID00114098	I have a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation to sell.
AID00114099	You can do better than that. This is the Gettysburg Address we're talking about.
AID00114100	Are you interested in buying the Gettysburg Address?
AID00114101	Mr. B, if I told you what my "interests" are, you抎 have me locked up.
AID00114102	Look. I like blowing stuff up. I just love that... "kaboom"! Ya know?
AID00114103	Well, I shoot my BB Gun any chance I get. I can fix that thing blindfolded, too.
AID00114104	I love using the computers and talking to my father's patients in the clinic.
AID00114105	I'd like to enter the prison.
AID00114106	PC says he understands role of Chris H
AID00114107	I take no pleasure in hiding the truth from Chris. But it is the creator's will, to which I must submit.
AID00114108	Wow! You really pulled the wool over his eyes!
AID00114109	PC confirms Chris H will be left behind
AID00114110	PC attempts JasonBrightSpeechCheck
AID00114111	What's too bad?
AID00114112	PC asks about Chris H
AID00114113	You're referring to Chris. I doubt you had much luck if you tried telling him that he's human.
AID00114114	We had the same discussions when he first appeared, and the same lack of success. He believes he is one of us.
AID00114115	Soon enough we realized that Chris was a gift from the creator. He is integral to the success of the Great Journey.
AID00114116	What's the deal with the human who let me in?
AID00114117	After all that you have done for us, I suppose you deserve to know everything...
AID00114118	When Chris came to us, we tried to convince him that he was human. But this only angered him. He seemed... lost.
AID00114119	We decided to let him stay with us for a few days, over the course of which we learned that his technical skills far surpassed our own.
AID00114120	It became clear that the creator had sent him to us, to ensure the success of the Great Journey.
AID00114121	Equally clear was that Chris should labor in blessed ignorance of his humanity, and his inability to make the journey himself.
AID00114122	It is no coincidence that two humans have been vital to the success of the Great Journey.
AID00114123	It is my belief that the creator sent you and Chris to expiate the sins of your kind against mine. You are redeemers both.
AID00114124	Let's talk about Chris.
AID00114125	Such is the creator's will. Vision upon vision has shown me that, were Chris to accompany us, he would die in minutes.
AID00114126	The radiation around the launch pad alone would kill Chris in minutes. The radioactivity of the Far Beyond is much stronger.
AID00114127	So you're going to leave Chris behind?
AID00114128	What can you tell me about the ghouls spotted to the west?
AID00114129	From what I've been able to gather, they've been seen messing around with the machinery up there. What could they be up to?
AID00114130	I don't know what else I could tell you. You could give No-bark a try, though, or Jeannie May.
AID00114131	What strange things have happened?
AID00114132	So there's a Vault down there, and you've never bothered investigating it?
AID00114133	Don't you know?
AID00114134	SnipersRevengeTooFar
AID00114135	If it's just the same to you, I think I'll stay in town. I feel safer that way.
AID00114136	Hey, I'm sorry, but I've gotta turn around. Leg's giving me some trouble.
AID00114137	Maybe some other time. I'm not really in the mood for a hike.
AID00114138	Come with me. There's something you should see, in front of the dinosaur.
AID00114139	Okay, if that's what you think.
AID00114140	Again? All right.
AID00114141	As long as we don't go too far. Jeannie May would have a fit if she saw me out and about.
AID00114142	Any excuse to get out of my room.
AID00114143	What, now? This better be good.
AID00114144	You say so, chief.
AID00114145	If you're talking about that thing that looks like the entrance to the center of the Earth, I think it might just be a pothole.
AID00114146	But we better check it out anyway.
AID00114147	I know we already did this, but this time things might turn out different.
AID00114148	I guess I can leave the store for a minute. I hope I don't miss any customers.
AID00114149	Really? Store's still okay, isn't it?
AID00114150	You sure seem worked up about something. I suppose I can hear you out.
AID00114151	It's kinda late, but I guess if it's important to you.
AID00114152	What can you tell me about Boone's wife?
AID00114153	How should I put it? I guess you could say she was kinda like a cactus flower. Real pretty to look at, but there was just no getting close to her.
AID00114154	She never did take to living here. She liked the big lights and fast living of New Vegas.
AID00114155	I got the feeling she was trying to get Boone to leave with her, but I guess she got tired of waiting.
AID00114156	Carla was a knockout. Whenever Boone walked around with her, he always had this funny grin on his face like he couldn't believe his luck.
AID00114157	I know we couldn't.
AID00114158	That wasn't the only reason she stuck out, though. That girl never minced words.
AID00114159	If she'd had better food or hospitality, she'd let you hear it. Trouble was, she usually had.
AID00114160	I don't think she meant it. She really was a sweet girl.
AID00114161	I think she just wanted to remind herself that there are still nicer places in this world than Novac. Who could blame her for that?
AID00114162	Boone. That's that sniper fella, works in the dinosaur, right? I only met them but once or twice.
AID00114163	They seemed real happy together. I really oughtta to get to know them better. They're probably nice folk.
AID00114164	Well, to be honest with you, I don't really know them two as well as I might.
AID00114165	I remember she had an edge about her, like she'd rather be someplace else. This kind of life ain't for everyone, that's for darn sure.
AID00114166	Can't say we spoke much. Boone did most of the buying for them. She was in the store once, but she didn't stay long.
AID00114167	Had a look on her face like she'd smelled something sour. But far as I can remember, the gift shop smelled fine. Well... fine as it always does.
AID00114168	What's wrong with Boone?
AID00114169	Nothing that wouldn't be wrong with any man who loses a wife, I suppose. Poor dear.
AID00114170	I know he thinks she was kidnapped, but I'm not so sure she didn't just run off on her own.
AID00114171	You could tell she was thinking about it ever since they arrived.
AID00114172	Had his wife taken. I don't think he'll ever be the same as he was. Damn shame.
AID00114173	I told the Rangers up at the station to keep an eye out, but there's just too much ground out there for them to cover.
AID00114174	Sorry, I didn't mean what I said. This seems like a nice town.
AID00114175	Well it is. Not everybody appreciates it like they oughtta.
AID00114176	Tell me more about REPCONN.
AID00114177	I just know what I've heard. There's supposed to be some ghouls that went in a while back.
AID00114178	Every so often there'll be a commotion from that direction - explosions and such.
AID00114179	What's been going on in town lately?
AID00114180	Well, let's see. Dusty McBride's been losing some Brahmin, but that's probably the heat more than anything. Honestly, it's been real quiet.
AID00114181	Ranger Andy's still hurt, but we got these two gentlemen snipers watching the road day and night, keeping the trash out of Novac.
AID00114182	They've been a blessing.
AID00114183	What's the quickest way out of this dump?
AID00114184	You can jump out the window, for all I care, mister.
AID00114185	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
AID00114186	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
AID00114187	You can jump out the window, for all I care, lady.
AID00114188	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
AID00114189	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
AID00114190	Where can I get some supplies?
AID00114191	Go see Cliff Briscoe at the Dino Bite Gift Shop, and tell him I sent you.
AID00114192	I think he gets lonely standing around in that dino belly all day. He'll be glad for the company.
AID00114193	What is there of interest around here?
AID00114194	Well, there's Dinky, the town mascot. He's a sight. You probably already saw him when you came in, but you can go up inside, too.
AID00114195	Up the road a ways to the west, there's REPCONN. That's the old rocket factory.
AID00114196	There's been some sinister characters out there lately, so you may want to stay clear.
AID00114197	Other than that, nothing to do but take it easy and enjoy good company.
AID00114198	What is this place?
AID00114199	We're in a little desert oasis, name of Novac. This is the Dino Dee-lite Motel, and it's mine.
AID00114200	We haven't met yet.
AID00114201	Oh, what am I doing? I got to thinking about making a good impression and plain forgot to tell you my name.
AID00114202	I'm Jeannie May. I take care of folks here at the motel. Long as they aren't trouble makers.
AID00114203	I'd like to buy all of your remaining rocket souvenirs.
AID00114204	Really? I never thought I'd see the day.
AID00114205	I mean... the day I'd part with them for such an incredibly low price. With so many other offers flooding in.
AID00114206	But I like you. I think maybe it's time. All that's left is in this storage room here. You can buy the key from my store.
AID00114207	PC asks how many souvenirs needed
AID00114208	PC hands over one or more souvenirs
AID00114209	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
AID00114210	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
AID00114211	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
AID00114212	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
AID00114213	Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
AID00114214	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
AID00114215	Let me see. Yes, that's the igniting agent! But we'll need more of these souvenirs. A total of five should do it...
AID00114216	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
AID00114217	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
AID00114218	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
AID00114219	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
AID00114220	Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
AID00114221	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
AID00114222	Why are there Fire Ants still down in the Metro tunnels?
AID00114223	Actually, I'm still not sure.
AID00114224	Please, if you know the truth, tell me. Those guys were friends of mine.
AID00114225	Okay. Keep me posted.
AID00114226	I found out who killed the Rangers at Station Charlie.
AID00114227	I'm afraid to ask.
AID00114228	Do Nothing.
AID00114229	Advance the Ranger Station quest.
AID00114230	The Rangers are soft. They're probably already dead.
AID00114231	Obviously you don't know the first damn thing about the Rangers. Without them, nobody in these parts would be safe.
AID00114232	No, I'm getting all worked up for nothing. Those boys are just fine.
AID00114233	A station full of Rangers ought to be able to handle themselves.
AID00114234	Yeah, who am I kidding? It's funny, you get stuck in your room for a few weeks, you start to worry the world's gonna fall apart without you.
AID00114235	Those guys are fine. They don't need me looking over their shoulders.
AID00114236	Would you feel better if I checked on your NCR friends for you?
AID00114237	Uh... no. No. They're gonna think I'm having trouble letting go. They're good soldiers. I don't give them enough credit.
AID00114238	I'm not interested in this town's problems.
AID00114239	Sorry you feel that way. Then again, I'm not so sure I want to know who did this, myself.
AID00114240	I'll come back when I know more.
AID00114241	Be careful out there.
AID00114242	<Lie> The attackers are all dead too. It's impossible to identify them.
AID00114243	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AID00114244	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
AID00114245	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AID00114246	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
AID00114247	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
AID00114248	Members of Caesar's Legion ambushed them.
AID00114249	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AID00114250	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
AID00114251	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AID00114252	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
AID00114253	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
AID00114254	I don't know the details. I just saw a lot of dead rangers.
AID00114255	God damn it! I just spoke to them the other day. If this is some kind of sick joke-
AID00114256	<Sighs> Nah, that'd be too far, even for those guys.
AID00114257	Listen, this could be trouble for all of us. Whoever did this is still out there, and they might come this way.
AID00114258	If you can find out who did this, we can be better prepared to deal with them if they come through here.
AID00114259	I went to the ranger station. Everyone there was wiped out.
AID00114260	What? What happened?
AID00114261	Show me.
AID00114262	Your body is injured, not your mind. You're kidding yourself if you think you're useless.
AID00114263	Heh. People don't exactly line up to find out what's in my head. Can't remember the last time someone suggested I knew something worth knowing.
AID00114264	You know, maybe there's something I can do for you. Since you've gone to all the trouble of flattering a crippled old soldier.
AID00114265	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
AID00114266	Let me show you how it's done.
AID00114267	Let's talk about something else.
AID00114268	<Laughs>Yeah. I'm with you there.
AID00114269	Like what?
AID00114270	What happened?
AID00114271	A few years back, we get a tip that some Legion slavers were holed up in this burnt out house a few klicks from where we were stationed.
AID00114272	We get there and it's deserted. No sign anyone's been there. I mean nothing. As we're leaving, I hear something behind me.
AID00114273	I turn around and there's this kid, just skin and bone, and he's looking up at us and he's scared half to death. Been hiding in a closet.
AID00114274	You're with the NCR, right?
AID00114275	Was. Was with them. That was back when my arm and leg used to work better.
AID00114276	I still like to pretend I'm a Ranger, though. I'll check in with the guys up at the station pretty regular on the ham radio.
AID00114277	Sometimes they stop by, tell me they're paying their respects, the smug bastards.
AID00114278	They haven't been responding to me, last couple of days. I guess they got tired of hearing me talk, but it's still got me a little worried.
AID00114279	Hell, listen to me talk. Like some damn mother hen.
AID00114280	Did you do something to your leg?
AID00114281	Yeah. Twice. Actually the first time it was more like half my body. Knocked me out of the Rangers.
AID00114282	This time it's mostly just reminded me how useless I've gotten.
AID00114283	What do you do here, Andy?
AID00114284	Right now? A whole lot of sitting on my keister and counting cracks in the ceiling. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
AID00114285	On better days I help keep the peace. Boone and Vargas watch the road, I watch the town. Tell myself I'm doing some good.
AID00114286	I did find her, unfortunately.
AID00114287	I see. Spare me the details. Goddamn. She had the yellowest smile...
AID00114288	You did your part, so I'll do mine. Go ahead and root around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
AID00114289	There is no stockpile of Stealth Boys in this building.
AID00114290	Liar! The invoice said Stealth Boys here! Antler read it out loud to me!
AID00114291	CliffBriscoeBarterCheck
AID00114292	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, I admit it. They've been collecting dust since before I got here. You can have them dirt cheap.
AID00114293	You don't have any offers for the rockets. You'd be lucky to get money at all.
AID00114294	Fuck off. I'm not going to help you.

AID00114362	Hey, I'm just here to help. All I want to do is be someone he can talk to.
AID00114363	Come on, all I want to do is talk. What harm could little old me do?
AID00114364	Hey, hot stuff. Why don't you tell me how I can see Ian?
AID00114365	Tell me how to see Ian and maybe we can talk... in private.
AID00114366	Let me see Ian, you filthy liar!
AID00114367	Please, you must let me speak to him!
AID00114368	Are you telling me that Ian is a cannibal?
AID00114369	Damn it, Vance! What did you do to him?
AID00114370	Wait a minute... What happened to him?
AID00114371	I have a letter for him. From his sister...
AID00114372	A cannibal by any other name is still a cannibal.
AID00114373	Your people eat human flesh, Vance. That's sick!
AID00114374	If I accept that you're no longer cannibals, what do I call you?
AID00114375	Wow, you're a real humanitarian.
AID00114376	What do you mean?
AID00114377	Your ways? So you're reforming these people?
AID00114378	None of this talk is necessary. I know exactly what you are.
AID00114379	Whoa, whoa... slow down there. I left my thesaurus at home.
AID00114380	Excuse me, but what does all that mean?
AID00114381	<Allow Vance to continue.>
AID00114382	I think I've stumbled across the world's first underground insane asylum!
AID00114383	What is this place?
AID00114384	This place is very different from any of the other settlements I've seen.
AID00114385	I'm not sure I should be the one telling you this.
AID00114386	If you keep attacking Arefu, they'll keep fighting back until everyone is dead.
AID00114387	Give those people a chance! They're defenseless.
AID00114388	How did you know Ian was trying to decide to stay or leave?
AID00114389	Before I talk about Ian, there's still the matter of Arefu to discuss...
AID00114390	Is there anything dangerous around there I should know about?
AID00114391	Who else lives in Arefu?
AID00114392	Maybe. Who wants to know?
AID00114393	He's fine. He's living with Lucy now. <Lie.>
AID00114394	Sorry, but Ian's dead. <Lie.>
AID00114395	No, he wasn't with the Family. <Lie.>
AID00114396	You ever take one of them out?
AID00114397	Oh come on, it's just gang nonsense.
AID00114398	Next time you shoot at me like that, you'd better not miss.
AID00114399	He's probably dead too.
AID00114400	I didn't find his body.
AID00114401	Why don't you leave?
AID00114402	Who's running the place now?
AID00114403	If there's been a breakout, why is anyone still here?
AID00114404	You seem friendly enough.
AID00114405	Let me see what you have.
AID00114406	I have a proposal for you from Vance, the Family's leader.

AID00114425	Nice place you have here.
AID00114426	Is this swill even safe to drink?
AID00114427	This place is real dump.
AID00114428	How dare you insult my taste in clothes.
AID00114429	I see you are also a person of refinement.
AID00114430	So I'm not good enough to shop here?
AID00114431	It's nice to see a family in business together.
AID00114432	You're a sweet little thing. Do you charge by the hour?
AID00114433	Can you tell me anything about the Rockwells' marriage?
AID00114434	No, and enough with the third degree already!
AID00114435	Nope, and it's unlikely they left him alive.
AID00114436	No, I only found the parents' bodies.
AID00114437	Ever heard of the Family?

AID00114461	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
AID00114462	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
AID00114463	If that doesn't work, you could always try using some chems.
AID00114464	Suits me - I've got plenty of other patients to take care of.
AID00114465	Heh. Good luck with that. Just try to remember the Cazadores crawling out of your skin aren't real.
AID00114466	But on the off chance they are, come back and see me.
AID00114467	You're making a mistake, but that's just my opinion. What do I know, after all? I've only studied medicine my entire life.
AID00114468	Suit yourself.
AID00114469	Yes, cure me.
AID00114470	Okay, there you are. The convulsions should stop in the next one to twelve weeks. If they don't, try holding on to something that's very still.
AID00114471	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00114472	All right, there you go. And don't complain about the taste.
AID00114473	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00114474	And there we go. Now, try to stay off the stuff, you hear?
AID00114475	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00114476	Why didn't you say so? No problem. I'll give you my free cure. Here, lean in. It's a special doctor secret.
AID00114477	Stop doing chems!
AID00114478	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
AID00114479	Hey, I'd love to help you out of the goodness of my heart, but I have an awful lot of patients to consider.
AID00114480	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
AID00114481	There, that's got it. Do be so eager to sample dangerous substances in the future, okay?
AID00114482	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00114483	Sorry, my supplies are rather limited, and we can only get more by trading. Which requires money. Money you don't have. Come back when you have some.
AID00114484	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
AID00114485	Okay... all done.
AID00114486	Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
AID00114487	I don't have 50 caps.
AID00114488	Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
AID00114489	Okay, Dad. Wish me luck.
AID00114490	I think I might be addicted to something.
AID00114491	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AID00114492	Hey, pipe down. We can't talk about that here, out in the open.
AID00114493	Oh, you mean you want a cure. Oh.
AID00114494	If you've seen half the things I've seen out in the Wasteland, I can't say I blame you. I might be able to help with that.
AID00114495	Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
AID00114496	I can't say that's something I treat all the time, but I should have something to help you through it.
AID00114497	Sure. I can help you out.
AID00114498	Could you repair my equipment?
AID00114499	What do you do here?
AID00114500	Expecting visitors?
AID00114501	Yeah. I guess maybe I am. But not like you.
AID00114502	Huh. Maybe it should've been you I was expecting all along.
AID00114503	Why are you here?
AID00114504	Expecting visitors?
AID00114505	Just looking around.
AID00114506	There's nothing up here.
AID00114507	There's a sniper.
AID00114508	I just wanted to check out the view.
AID00114509	No reason.
AID00114510	I'm meeting new people.
AID00114511	I think you'd better leave.
AID00114512	I heard there was a sniper nest up here.
AID00114513	Just making friendly conversation.
AID00114514	I don't have friends here.
AID00114515	Do you treat everyone around here like this?
AID00114516	I don't see how that affects me.
AID00114517	Wait. You just got into town. Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
AID00114518	I didn't say I wanted to be your friend.
AID00114519	Well, I'm not from here.
AID00114520	No. No you're not, are you? Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
AID00114521	Why is that?
AID00114522	I need someone I can trust. You're a stranger. That's a start.
AID00114523	So now you want something from me.
AID00114524	Are you going to try and kill me?
AID00114525	Not unless you give me a reason.
AID00114526	You only trust strangers?
AID00114527	I said it was a start. This town... nobody looks me straight in the eye anymore.
AID00114528	What do you want me to do?
AID00114529	I want you to find something out for me. I don't know if there's anything to find, but I need someone to try.
AID00114530	My wife was taken from our home by Legion slavers one night while I was on watch.
AID00114531	They knew when to come and what route to take, and they only took Carla. Someone set it up. I don't know who.
AID00114532	Yes.
AID00114533	You're trying to track down your wife?
AID00114534	My wife's dead. I want the son of a bitch who sold her.
AID00114535	How do you know your wife is dead?
AID00114536	I know, all right? And that's all you need to know.
AID00114537	What do I do if I find this person?
AID00114538	Bring him out in front of the nest here while I'm on duty. I work nights.
AID00114539	I'll give you my NCR beret to put on. It'll be our signal, so I know you're standing with him.
AID00114540	And I'll take care of the rest. I need to do this myself.
AID00114541	I'll see what I can do to help you out.
AID00114542	Good. I'll make it worth your while. And one more thing. We shouldn't speak again. Not until it's over.
AID00114543	No one in town knows that I know what happened to my wife. Best they never know. Or the Legion will be after me next.
AID00114544	No.
AID00114545	I don't know who you think you're kidding. I've lived here for more than a year.
AID00114546	Anyway, I need someone I can trust, and you may be a liar, but you're also a stranger. And that's a start.
AID00114547	I think I'm in the wrong place.
AID00114548	Yeah, looks that way.
AID00114549	What was I supposed to do again?
AID00114550	Find out who had Carla kidnapped. Bring him out in front of the dinosaur while I'm working my shift.
AID00114551	Let me know it's him by putting on the beret I gave you. That's it. Now go on.
AID00114552	I'm leaving.
AID00114553	Don't come here again till it's over.
AID00114554	I found the bill of sale.
AID00114555	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It'd be like them to keep paperwork.
AID00114556	Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
AID00114557	His story didn't add up.
AID00114558	You didn't have any proof?
AID00114559	His story didn't add up.
AID00114560	You didn't have any proof?
AID00114561	Her story didn't add up.
AID00114562	Just a hunch.
AID00114563	You didn't have any proof?
AID00114564	I just wanted you to kill him.
AID00114565	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join him.
AID00114566	I just wanted you to kill him.
AID00114567	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join her.
AID00114568	I just wanted you to kill her.
AID00114569	Advance the sniper quest.
AID00114570	Are you an outlaw now?
AID00114571	No. People die out there. Often enough that no one worries about blame. They're too anxious to forget it happened in the first place, I guess.
AID00114572	Besides. I was on break when it happened.
AID00114573	What will you do after this?
AID00114574	I don't know. I won't be staying, I know that. Don't see much point in anything right now, except hunting legionaries.
AID00114575	Maybe I'll wander, like you.
AID00114576	The culprit was obvious when all the pieces fell into place.
AID00114577	Well, that's about all the proof I could hope for, I guess. Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
AID00114578	I deduced it with a simple process of elimination.
AID00114579	It was the closest to proof that there was.
AID00114580	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. He might not have done a goddamn thing.
AID00114581	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. She might not have done a goddamn thing.
AID00114582	Get out. I don't ever want to see you here again. And you stay the hell away from me.
AID00114583	You needed someone to blame. What does it matter who?
AID00114584	Come with me. Let's go after the Legion.
AID00114585	You don't want to do that.
AID00114586	We'll kill more with two of us.
AID00114587	Yeah. That might be true. And that's reason enough for me to take you up on it, I suppose. But this isn't gonna end well.
AID00114588	Fine. Let's get out of here.
AID00114589	Snipers work better in pairs.
AID00114590	Hnh. Yeah. Working on your own, you're a lot less effective. I've been there and paid for it.
AID00114591	But this isn't gonna end well.
AID00114592	I thought snipers worked in teams.
AID00114593	You're right. I don't.
AID00114594	You've done enough for me. What's coming next, that's something for me to deal with on my own.

AID00114642	Good news, Three Dog. I already have the dish.
AID00114643	This is a pretty convincing simulation...
AID00114644	What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
AID00114645	Nice day, isn't it?
AID00114646	General information about McGee personally
AID00114647	I'm from Hub originally, but it's been a long time since I saw it. I'm on my second tour here. Most Non-Commissioned Officers are.
AID00114648	Where are you from?
AID00114649	Want to be sheriff?
AID00114650	What's the news?
AID00114651	Do you think I'm blind? Of course I can see the Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
AID00114652	You have any other obvious facts you'd like to share? Don't fist fight with Deathclaws? No kissing Cazadores?
AID00114653	Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
AID00114654	I can't imagine that deputy of theirs is worth more than a spit. I was on lookout when he got frog marched over to Bison Steve.
AID00114655	If I had a long rifle or the order I would have taken out the Powder Gangers to save him, but I didn't. His tough shit I guess.
AID00114656	I rescued Primm's deputy, but the town's still lawless.
AID00114657	PC asks Hayes to establish law in Primm
AID00114658	We know Primm is a great strategic point, and we aren't blind to the needs of the town, but we're barely holding our own against the Powder Gangers.
AID00114659	We don't have the guns or the personnel needed to carry out our mission, much less take on defending this town as well.
AID00114660	Primm is in dire need of some real law.
AID00114661	Have you gotten us any additional support yet?
AID00114662	I'd like to talk to you about protecting Primm.
AID00114663	Yes, I just got word of that. There's a squad of rangers standing by.
AID00114664	Sergeant McGee will take over as sheriff and the rangers will be his deputies. This town will be an NCR territory.
AID00114665	This means that aside from protection, the citizens will also need to become registered NCR citizens and pay any appropriate and associated taxes.
AID00114666	I got extra troop support for Primm.
AID00114667	That ranger squad is still standing by, and McGee is anxious to take over as sheriff. Are you ready for me to make the call?
AID00114668	I want to talk about that NCR protecting Primm.
AID00114669	Tell me about the NCR
AID00114670	What are you doing out here?
AID00114671	We were sent out here to hold back the tide of convicts from the correctional facility.
AID00114672	As you can probably tell, we aren't doing the kind of job we could be doing.
AID00114673	What are you doing out here?
AID00114674	The PC has briefed McGee
AID00114675	Never mind, I'll find someone else.
AID00114676	Yeah, good luck with that.
AID00114677	I'll look for another solution.
AID00114678	Good doggie.
AID00114679	Take a hike, mutt.
AID00114680	Actually, I have some stuff to take care of first.
AID00114681	The PC tells Meyers to become sheriff

AID00114695	What are you doing in Underworld?
AID00114696	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00114697	You seem kind of addicted to the stuff... Is it safe to drink?
AID00114698	Is there anything else you're looking for?
AID00114699	Sure, sure. I'm working on it. Really.
AID00114700	Where did you say the Failsafe was?
AID00114701	There's nothing in that house. You're lying, or crazy, or both.
AID00114702	Um... I went into the abandoned house, but I didn't see anything.
AID00114703	Just leave me alone. I'm busy.
AID00114704	How come you're the only one who seems to know this?
AID00114705	Well, I guess it's time to find out. I'll go there myself.
AID00114706	Would you be interested in buying this Stradivarius violin for the museum?
AID00114707	No thanks, I think I'll hold onto it.
AID00114708	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
AID00114709	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.

AID00114712	What makes you think this tunnel won't be guarded? It could be a trap...
AID00114713	That sounds awfully complicated. Why can't I just get out the normal way?
AID00114714	Sounds like a good plan. Let's get out of here!
AID00114715	I know how you feel. I lost my Dad.
AID00114716	Want to come with me? It's dangerous out here all alone.
AID00114717	Don't worry, boy. You get used to losing people out here.

AID00114721	Been a while since I tasted dog meat. Now, play dead. Forever.
AID00114722	Looks like you've got some fight left in you, yet. That's a good sign.
AID00114723	What's the matter, boy? Lose your master?
AID00114724	You know, I think you're the first dog I've met that didn't try to eat me.
AID00114725	Shut up, mutt.
AID00114726	You're pretty friendly, aren't you, boy?
AID00114727	Good teeth, strong claws. You're a fighting dog, aren't you?
AID00114728	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.

AID00114733	Fine, be that way.
AID00114734	Shoo, dog. Get out of here.
AID00114735	I've been to the lab. He wasn't there. Just some old holotapes...
AID00114736	I've been to Project Purity. He wasn't there.

AID00114751	I don't know. Maybe Moriarty's right and you're just a junkie.
AID00114752	Look, just give me some of your caps, and I'll tell him you're gone.
AID00114753	Look, just give me the caps and I'll tell him you're gone.
AID00114754	I don't care. I'm just here for caps.
AID00114755	Slow down. Tell me your side of the story.
AID00114756	You'd better calm down, before I put you down.
AID00114757	Whoa, calm down... Who the hell is Moriarty?
AID00114758	Who's Moriarty?
AID00114759	I don't deal with junkies. Hand over all your caps. Now!
AID00114760	Just hand over the caps, and I'll be out of your way.
AID00114761	Yes, and he says you owe him some caps.
AID00114762	Look, I need a way to get some caps or I'll never have the money to pay you.
AID00114763	No way, Moriarty. No favors.
AID00114764	So, you want me to do your dirty work?
AID00114765	Sure, anything to get the information.
AID00114766	You don't still offer your... services, do you?

AID00114785	You're a liar, Moriarty. I know where I grew up.
AID00114786	You're wrong. My Dad never would have lied to me.
AID00114787	Oh, I wasn't born in the Vault? That's complete bullshit, and you know it.
AID00114788	My Dad told me we were born in Vault 101...
AID00114789	Stay here. Maybe I'll come back for you.
AID00114790	Where can I find Joseph?
AID00114791	Geez, don't strain yourself on my account... I just need a G.E.C.K.
AID00114792	Can you tell me about that suit of armor you people wear?
AID00114793	You mentioned something about Galaxy News Radio?
AID00114794	Who did you say you were again?
AID00114795	Tell me about Primm.
AID00114796	My mother taught me never to say something 'less it was nice. So I don't have nothing to say about Primm, for the time being at least.
AID00114797	It's a sad state of affairs. Discuss it with Mr. Nash if you care to. Just makes me want to cry.
AID00114798	Thanks to you, Primm's on the way back up. With folks watching over us, I think the raiders will keep their distance.
AID00114799	Do you have anything for sale?
AID00114800	Sure, have a look.
AID00114801	Well yes and no. My shop's got plenty of stock.
AID00114802	Problem is I ain't going into my shop until I know it's good and safe.
AID00114803	Give me a moment to get back to my shop and I'll show you my stock.
AID00114804	Things are pretty good with Meyers watching over us. I can give you a little bit of a discount.
AID00114805	Yep, and I got more ammunition now that the NCR keeps supplies flowing in.
AID00114806	On the other hand I'm payin' them NCR taxes, so now you got to as well.
AID00114807	What happened to Primm?
AID00114808	Let's see. Been tough around here for a good while now. Worse since them thugs kidnapped our deputy.
AID00114809	It started with that breakout from the prison up the road. First there was just a few thugs rolling through town, but then they got organized.
AID00114810	Now they call themselves Powder Gangsters or something, and run around throwing dynamite and shooting people.
AID00114811	Little while ago a good chunk of them left whatever kind of organization they got up there to squeeze all the food and drink out of us they could.
AID00114812	What's going on in Primm?
AID00114813	We got rule of law again, but of the martial variety. NCR orders us around like junior soldiers. Better than lawlessness, though.
AID00114814	How's Primm these days?
AID00114815	Got a new sheriff, as you know. Meyer's a bit rougher-hewn than I might've liked, but he seems like a good sort. So far, so good.
AID00114816	How's Primm these days?
AID00114817	Never mind.
AID00114818	Guess you'll be needing to find some, huh? Come back when you do.
AID00114819	I don't have any.
AID00114820	I have some radscorpion glands. Can you make me some casserole?
AID00114821	Does sound good, don't it? How many radscorpion glands you got?
AID00114822	I'd like some of that radscorpion venom casserole.
AID00114823	I have a bunch.
AID00114824	Is that right? Then hand 'em over and I'll get to baking a whole batch of casseroles!
AID00114825	I have a bunch of radscorpion glands.
AID00114826	I have 3 glands.
AID00114827	Hand 'em over and I'll get to baking!
AID00114828	I've got a few radscorpion glands.
AID00114829	I have 1 radscorpion gland.
AID00114830	One's enough to make a helping. Hand it over!
AID00114831	I have one radscorpion gland.
AID00114832	[Ask about services]
AID00114833	I'm Ruby Nash. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
AID00114834	My husband and I are Primm long-timers. He fancies himself a trader, and I know my way around a kitchen.
AID00114835	Who are you?
AID00114836	On second thought... I think I'll keep it to myself.
AID00114837	It's Irving.
AID00114838	You never did tell me what I'd win.
AID00114839	Never mind.
AID00114840	Can't we work something out? Maybe share the winnings?
AID00114841	Come on, it will really throw those guys for a loop if you tell me.
AID00114842	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
AID00114843	Well, Vance isn't going to be able to help anymore.
AID00114844	Vance is dead, Ian. I'm so sorry.
AID00114845	No time to discuss it. We're getting the heck out of here!
AID00114846	You're tough to find.
AID00114847	Evan King sent me to look for you.
AID00114848	Never mind.
AID00114849	Nothing I can say will change your mind will it?
AID00114850	I changed my mind, Ian. I think you should stay here.
AID00114851	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
AID00114852	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
AID00114853	Do what you want. This is a waste of time.
AID00114854	If you want to stay, then stay. You have to do what you feel is right.
AID00114855	Look, this place isn't the answer. You need to go home and face your demons.
AID00114856	I delivered the letter to Ian.
AID00114857	No, I lied. I'm their newest member!
AID00114858	Look, maybe you better explain what's going on first.
AID00114859	I was hoping to find out what the Family did here.

AID00114951	That's all I wanted to know.
AID00114952	How long have you been here?

AID00115043	Given the circumstances, termination was the best option - so your actions demonstrated loyalty, good judgment, and prowess in combat.
AID00115044	I'm not sure.
AID00115045	That's right. Because you did nothing to find out. Your collar was rigged with a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
AID00115046	It would seem you are a brute, but even a brute can be of use. Particularly one capable of taking down an NCR Ranger one on one.
AID00115047	Since you completed your assigned task, I will allow you to come and go from the bunker freely. So let's get that collar off you.
AID00115048	There, that's better, I hope. Now that we have that bit of unpleasantness out of the way, there is a matter that I would like to discuss with you.
AID00115049	Stop by the command room when you can. Oh, and bear in mind, if you end up betraying us, we will know it - and there will be no mercy.
AID00115050	The ranger won't be a problem. He's dead.
AID00115051	How do you know he won't be missed, that other rangers won't come looking for him? Or NCR patrols? Did you just make matters worse?

AID00115059	Keep pointing that gun at me and I'll stick it up your ass.
AID00115060	[FAILED] I'll point my rifle at anything and anyone I please to! Got that, powder ganger?
AID00115061	Don't point! It's rude! Especially with guns!
AID00115062	I'll just be going...

AID00115068	Relax, little lady. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?

AID00115076	HVRamosComment
AID00115077	Great, looks like they're going at it again.
AID00115078	I can take care of the Ranger.
AID00115079	Very well. I'll be interested to see how thoroughly and efficiently you carry out your mission.
AID00115080	Paladin Ramos will escort you back to the bunker's entrance and set you loose. Notice that I said "loose," not "free."
AID00115081	You are not free to carry the secret of this bunker's location beyond Hidden Valley - until I'm convinced that you're capable and dependable.
AID00115082	To underscore this point, you'll be fitted with an explosive collar. Wander off, and it will detonate. Focus on your mission, and you'll be fine.
AID00115083	I was just exploring the area and noticed your patrol coming out of here.
AID00115084	You took an extreme risk in coming here. My policy towards trespassers has not been... lenient.
AID00115085	The security of this bunker is my foremost concern, and I take pains to minimize our exposure topside.
AID00115086	For this reason, I might be interested in contracting with an outsider, who can accomplish certain tasks - some basic, some a bit more... involved.
AID00115087	An NCR Ranger has begun to set up post in one of the other bunkers up top, for example. I want him driven off. Understood?
AID00115088	HVMcNamaraHardinOpening
AID00115089	I understand your concern, Edgar, but the answer is no.
AID00115090	Then what do you propose? Every day that he's here, the risk increases.
AID00115091	And our chances of exposure might be one hundred percent if we act rashly.
AID00115092	Better that than not act at all!
AID00115093	No, I will not endanger the entire chapter so recklessly.
AID00115094	Look, I've made my decision. Abide by it. I have other matters to attend to.

AID00115130	If it means that much to you, I'll take it.
AID00115131	Certainly. Thank you.
AID00115132	Who's Boone?
AID00115133	Boone's a sniper, same as me. Used to spot for him when we were enlisted with the NCR.
AID00115134	After we got out, I talked him into settling down here. So, here we are.
AID00115135	I'd introduce you, but uh... we're not so friendly right now.
AID00115136	Why are you on bad terms with Boone?
AID00115137	Me and his wife, we didn't see eye-to-eye on some things. We had some pretty big arguments.
AID00115138	One day she turns up missing, and he hasn't said a word to me since.
AID00115139	What did you and Boone's wife argue about?
AID00115140	Man, you name it.
AID00115141	See, I grew up in North Vegas. Me and my cousins. We were some bad seeds. Got in with a gang. I loved it.
AID00115142	Then something happened, and I couldn't handle it anymore.
AID00115143	So, I enlisted. Earned my future. Brought down my best friend to share that future with me.
AID00115144	And here was this woman who was too good for it, trying to take him away. So yeah. I didn't see eye-to-eye with the bitch.
AID00115145	Who would want to hurt Boone's wife?
AID00115146	Man, everybody. That girl didn't have one friend in this whole town. She didn't want any.
AID00115147	She wanted to sit in her room all day and make herself miserable. And she went out of her way to be rude.
AID00115148	She upset a lot of people. You wouldn't have liked her, either.
AID00115149	Did you have anything to do with Boone's wife's disappearance?
AID00115150	Believe me. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I owe somebody. Big. I figured Boone would come around after a while.
AID00115151	But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her that things will never go back to the way they were.

AID00115212	Aren't you a little young for all this?
AID00115213	What do you make of the Enclave, Squire?
AID00115214	I don't suppose you know anything about the Super Mutants?
AID00115215	What about the Brotherhood's history in this area?
AID00115216	I need medical supplies.
AID00115217	I guess I can spare a few things.
AID00115218	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AID00115219	Yeah, and I need sterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
AID00115220	Sure.
AID00115221	I'd love to help you out, but I'm pretty strapped here as it is. I really don't have anything to sell you.
AID00115222	Hmm... well, I am better set for supplies now that you helped me out. I guess I can part with some of them.
AID00115223	Here's what I've got.
AID00115224	I suppose I have a few things around that I can spare.
AID00115225	Hey, can you hook me up with some chems?
AID00115226	Care to share anything about the Super Mutants?
AID00115227	So... Any thoughts on the Enclave?
AID00115228	Who was it?
AID00115229	Molerat men, come up from the Underneath to steal young women with promises of riches and fancy mud mansions with all the latest designer appliances.
AID00115230	They covet our ladyfolk's long hair for wigs, it's said, being either bald or balding themselves.
AID00115231	What do you know about the abduction of Boone's wife?
AID00115232	Seen it all. Seen shadowy folk come to his room and leave again in the middle of the night. Thought one might've gone in the lobby, too, for a spell.
AID00115233	Could be that person went in to get something. Or use the john maybe. Mighty interesting either way, you ask me.
AID00115234	I thought it was cannibals, come to eat us all for sure, so I kept out of sight. But now I know better.
AID00115235	Has anybody been acting strange lately?
AID00115236	I don't trust a man that doesn't have something strange going on about him, 'cause it means he's hiding it from you.
AID00115237	If a man's wearing his pants on his head or if he says his words backwards from time to time, you know it's all laid out there for you.
AID00115238	But if he's friendly to strangers and keeps his home spick-and-span, more often than not he's done something even his own ma couldn't forgive.
AID00115239	What else do you know about the deaths at the corral?
AID00115240	I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me.
AID00115241	He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground.
AID00115242	Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible.
AID00115243	Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it.
AID00115244	Walked right past me having an argument with somebody.
AID00115245	But I only saw the one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.
AID00115246	What's been going on in town?
AID00115247	There's been things of a disturbing nature going on at the McBride Corral.
AID00115248	Seems every night one of their herd meets a most unnatural death, and always there's holes all over the body.
AID00115249	Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don't pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there's bullets in them.
AID00115250	Well, says No-bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we're in.
AID00115251	Let's talk about something else.
AID00115252	Good idea. It ain't safe to stay on the same topic for too long.
AID00115253	Who do you think is actually at the factory?
AID00115254	Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.
AID00115255	Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
AID00115256	I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes.
AID00115257	Although being a scientist, I have to admit I might've just blinked for longer than usual, what with the shock of seeing a commie ghost and so forth.
AID00115258	Is anything interesting happening in the area?
AID00115259	Folks'll tell you that they seen ghouls up near the rocket factory.
AID00115260	Sensationalist hooey, cooked up by superstitious yokels seeing phantoms of their own imagining.
AID00115261	VDialogueNovacNobarkName
AID00115262	I'm not sure who started it. It wasn't a very nice name, but he took to calling himself by it, so we all had to.
AID00115263	I don't even remember what his real name is.
AID00115264	Anyway, I think it comes from that expression that people say when you're crazy - that not all of your dogs are barking. Poor No-bark.
AID00115265	How did No-bark get his name?
AID00115266	'Cause they know I ain't just barking here. What I say's got bite, 'cause it's the truth.
AID00115267	Them quack doctors can say what they want about all the radscorpion stings that done pierced my skull. I know what I seen.
AID00115268	Why do they call you No-bark?
AID00115269	If you're going to be weird, I'm just going to leave.
AID00115270	Weird's just normal when normal decides to start taking notice of things. You just think about that.
AID00115271	Now what'd you come here for?
AID00115272	I have to go now.
AID00115273	Let me know if you meet anyone suspicious.
AID00115274	<Glare at No-bark>
AID00115275	You said you'd stab me with that dirty knife.
AID00115276	Okay, okay. Just speak up a little. But not so much that They hear you. They got people everywhere, always listening.
AID00115277	We can talk from this distance.
AID00115278	You sure, now? It's kinda hard to hear you.
AID00115279	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, mister, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
AID00115280	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
AID00115281	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, missy, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
AID00115282	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
AID00115283	Talk about what?
AID00115284	Who tried to make you talk?
AID00115285	Confound it, No-bark, you done it again. You let on that you know things. Now they'll never let you be.
AID00115286	All right, stranger, you got me. What do you want to know?
AID00115287	I don't mean any harm.
AID00115288	We'll just see about that. You come any closer and I'm liable to stick you with my stickin' knife. Ol' Sticky's feeling mighty ornery this day.
AID00115289	What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?

AID00115311	And help yourself to anything in that freezer over yonder. We got more steaks in there than we'd be able to eat in a year.
AID00115312	Well we surely appreciate for what you done for us. Even without our stock, just having peace of mind means the world to us.
AID00115313	Take this, compliments of Alice and myself. We'd give you more if we could, knowing you risked your neck for us.
AID00115314	I'll see if I can catch whoever's responsible.
AID00115315	We'd be grateful. Especially if you find 'em before they get my whole stock. But don't go getting yourself killed over it.
AID00115316	Alice and I'll find a way to make do. Always have.
AID00115317	Did you get a look at the attacker?
AID00115318	Beg your pardon mister, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
AID00115319	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
AID00115320	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
AID00115321	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they've taken to shooting from the west side.
AID00115322	Beg your pardon ma'am, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
AID00115323	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
AID00115324	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
AID00115325	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they're usually shooting from the west side.
AID00115326	How is business lately?
AID00115327	You must mean what's left of it. Somebody's been attacking our animals at night. We're down to less than half of what we had a few weeks back.
AID00115328	Every night around midnight Alice and I'll wake up to some crazy hollering and gun shots. You'd think the world was ending all over again.
AID00115329	But it's just one animal each night. They don't take it or carve it up or nothing. Just leave it there, all full of holes.
AID00115330	Tell me what you know about the attacks.
AID00115331	Well, it's the strangest thing. Last time it happened I could swear I heard someone cry out for help. Sounded like a big fella.
AID00115332	But when we finally got up the gumption to go look outside all we found was our cattle. And I know what they sound like when they get upset.
AID00115333	I can't imagine what went on. Dusty can probably tell you more about it.
AID00115334	What can you tell me about the attacks on your ranch?
AID00115335	What do you do here in Novac?
AID00115336	Oh, I tend to my ranch, that's about it. Alice'll tell you. I don't get out a whole lot.
AID00115337	I heard you've been losing livestock.
AID00115338	Losing don't describe it. It's a massacre. Few more days and there won't be nothing left to lose.

AID00115344	Advance the Chupacabra quest.
AID00115345	Your friends are safe. I just helped them sneak out of here.
AID00115346	I haven't found her yet.
AID00115347	I'm not expecting good news, but keep looking.
AID00115348	I'll try to find your friend.
AID00115349	Thanks. Let me know what you find out. Here's hoping she's okay.
AID00115350	What can you tell me about the "demons"?
AID00115351	I kill them on sight, so we haven't had much time to get acquainted.
AID00115352	They're hard to see, obviously, but they aren't too smart when it comes to tactics. Or not stepping in traps.
AID00115353	What can you tell me about the creatures out there?
AID00115354	How did you end up trapped down here?
AID00115355	First off, I'm not trapped. This was a tactical choice, all right?
AID00115356	I'm no match for those things out there, so I found a good defensive position, and I've been defending it, right?
AID00115357	...Aw, who am I fooling? I'm trapped. Name's Harland. Pleased to meet you.
AID00115358	What happened was, I was escorting folks down to work when those things attacked us.
AID00115359	Most of the fight was upstairs, but some folks panicked and made for the basement. And I went after them.
AID00115360	Well, turns out there were even more of those bastards down here than upstairs, and things went to shit fast.
AID00115361	I couldn't find the others, so I fell back to this room and set up a nice little kill zone. End of story.
AID00115362	I'm not delicate. Radroach meat for protein, condensation off the pipes for water, and I do my business over in the far corner.
AID00115363	I wouldn't say it's been comfy.
AID00115364	How have you survived?
AID00115365	How can I help get you out of this room?
AID00115366	Ha! Well, you're polite, I'll give you that. If this was just between you and me, I'd do as you ask. But it's not.
AID00115367	I had a friend with me when those mutant bastards came out of nowheres. She panicked and ran the wrong direction - further into the basement.
AID00115368	She's probably dead, but I ain't leaving until I know for sure. I'd have gone looking myself, except I wouldn't last a minute out there.
AID00115369	You, on the other hand, seem pretty resourceful. Find my friend, and I'll get out of your way.
AID00115370	Looks like I have to kill you.
AID00115371	Then you're dumber than you look, smoothskin. Eat this!
AID00115372	I need to search this room.
AID00115373	You don't look like the other ghouls from Bright's group.
AID00115374	Guess the outfit gives that away, huh? I never did buy into that religious mumbo-jumbo with the robes and all that shit.
AID00115375	It gets lonely out in the wastes, okay? And I don't have to tell you that Bright's group has got some fine-looking ghoulettes in it!
AID00115376	Eh... or maybe I would have to tell you...
AID00115377	Anyway, I helped them out, and they kept me supplied with ammo and pleasant company.
AID00115378	Who are you?
AID00115379	PC turns in souvenir rockets
AID00115380	This souvenir rocket I have glows. Will it serve as fuel?
AID00115381	PC Turns in jar of atomic fuel
AID00115382	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
AID00115383	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all that's needed now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
AID00115384	I found an entire container of the igniting agent.
AID00115385	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
AID00115386	Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
AID00115387	I found an entire container of the igniting agent.
AID00115388	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
AID00115389	I found an entire container of the igniting agent.
AID00115390	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
AID00115391	Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
AID00115392	I found an entire container of the igniting agent.
AID00115393	MQ11ElderSarahConv
AID00115394	That's all I needed to know.
AID00115395	Isn't it dangerous being this deep into the city?
AID00115396	How did all of the Ghouls end up here?
AID00115397	What was this place before the Ghouls moved in?
AID00115398	Do you know anything about Underworld?
AID00115399	You don't get a lot of customers, do you?
AID00115400	You run this place with Greta?
AID00115401	What do you know about Underworld?
AID00115402	He works for a guy up in Megaton. I think he might be a slave.
AID00115403	He's working in a bar in Megaton.
AID00115404	MegProtectronTalkNoEntry2
AID00115405	All right. I'm going to go have a look around.
AID00115406	CitTalkShortGeneric2
AID00115407	CitTalkShortGeneric
AID00115408	I'm working on it, okay?
AID00115409	Yeah, it's taken care of. Should be safe now.
AID00115410	JNashAboutLaw
AID00115411	Well, you can call Beagle a deputy so long as you don't harbor too high an opinion of the word.
AID00115412	Boy was 'bout as useful as tits on a radscorpion. Only qualification he ever had was to be brother to the wife of the sheriff.
AID00115413	Still, I s'pose he don't deserve what's befell him. We would've considered paying the ransom, if we'd had caps to spare.
AID00115414	You say Powder Gangers kidnapped Primm's deputy?
AID00115415	I feel safer already. Meanwhile, there's still more of them Powder Gangers out there than I care to count.
AID00115416	What we need around here is a real sheriff. Someone who can help fight off the next attack.
AID00115417	I rescued Deputy Beagle.
AID00115418	Kind of too bad you didn't do it the other way around! Primm ain't got no future until rule of law comes back to town.
AID00115419	I freed Deputy Beagle and killed the Powder Gangers.
AID00115420	Finally decided to make yourself useful, huh? If you can bring the law back to Primm, we'll all be in your debt.
AID00115421	I'll find Primm a new sheriff.
AID00115422	PaulineGun
AID00115423	Why would I deny it? I was the one that hacked that Cowboy Robot while Vance kept him busy. Ain't the first thing we stole. Won't be the last.
AID00115424	I know the two of you stole Vance's gun down in Primm.
AID00115425	PualinePlanSucks
AID00115426	You'll see! You'll feel stupid that you made fun of us when you learn how rich we are!
AID00115427	Your plan is going to get you both killed.
AID00115428	SammyNeverHeardofYou
AID00115429	Simple! Up 'til now, we committed our crimes stealthily, leaving no evidence behind. So we never built a rep.
AID00115430	But that's gonna change with our next score. You just wait and see.
AID00115431	You sound pretty tough. I wonder why I've never heard of you.
AID00115432	PaulineNeverHeardOfYou
AID00115433	We ain't never heard of you, either, so the not being impressed is mutual.
AID00115434	Come a week or so, though, and everyone will've heard of Sammy and Pauline! Just you wait!
AID00115435	You sound pretty tough. Why haven't I heard of you two before?
AID00115436	PaulineWhoAreYou
AID00115437	I'm Pauline, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal couple!
AID00115438	You'd best not mess with us, or you'll have a bullet hole where your eye used to be!
AID00115439	Who are you?
AID00115440	SammyWhoAreYou
AID00115441	Me? I'm Sammy, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal duo!
AID00115442	You better not mess with us or you'll end up face down in a shallow grave!
AID00115443	Who are you?
AID00115444	PrimmSlimGunNo
AID00115445	Dang it. I hope you'll keep looking.
AID00115446	I haven't found the gun.
AID00115447	PrimmSlimGunYes
AID00115448	Those thieves had some gall, stealing from a museum dedicated to romanticizing a couple of criminals!
AID00115449	I'll make sure the gun ends up back on display. I thank you, Primm thanks you, and I do believe Vance'd thank you, if he could.
AID00115450	I found the gun. Here it is.
AID00115451	PrimmSlimAboutHimself
AID00115452	Primm Slim at your service! Authentic cowpoke and official spokesbot of the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum! Yeehaw!
AID00115453	Who are you?
AID00115454	PrimmSlimVVHistoryNo
AID00115455	Have it your way, pardner. Maybe work up your curiosity by having a look at thrilling exhibits like the genuine Death Car and Vance's machine gun!
AID00115456	Another time, maybe.
AID00115457	PrimmSlimVVHistoryYes
AID00115458	Yahoo! I ain't had a chance to tell their tale in a mess of years.
AID00115459	First things first: any bosh you've heard about Vikki and Vance being copycats ain't nothing but ill-tempered slander.
AID00115460	Fact is, they begun their crime spree two days before Bonnie and Clyde robbed their first bank - so who was copying who?
AID00115461	Now true, Vikki and Vance didn't exactly cut a wide swath of murder and bank robbery across the central U.S., like Bonnie and Clyde did.
AID00115462	It was more like a narrow swath of shoplifting, check-cashing fraud, and gas pump driveoffs - but crime is crime! They drove reckless, too.
AID00115463	Having lived by the gun - well, Vance owned one, anyway - it was only fitting that the duo of desperados would die by the gun.
AID00115464	Perhaps it was fate itself that accidentally drove them into a crossfire between police and a gang of bank robbers in Plano, Texas.
AID00115465	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki would have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
AID00115466	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire tore the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
AID00115467	You can put your eyes on the genuine Death Car just over yonder, and there's Vance's machine gun in the case next to it!
AID00115468	Tell me the whole story of Vikki and Vance.
AID00115469	You got it, Pardner. Primm Slim loves to spin a yarn.
AID00115470	First things first: any bosh you've heard about Vikki and Vance being copycats ain't nothing but ill-tempered slander.
AID00115471	Fact is, they begun their crime spree two days before Bonnie and Clyde robbed their first bank - so who was copying who?
AID00115472	Now true, Vikki and Vance didn't exactly cut a wide swath of murder and bank robbery across the central U.S., like Bonnie and Clyde did.

AID00115476	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki might have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
AID00115477	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire shot the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
AID00115478	You can put your eyes on the genuine Death Car just over yonder, and there's Vance's machine gun in the case next to it!
AID00115479	Tell me about Vikki and Vance again.
AID00115480	PrimmSlimAboutCasinoMuseum
AID00115481	Why, this is the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum - Primm's Primm-eer tourist attraction and resort destination! Yeehaw!
AID00115482	What is this place?
AID00115483	BeagleSheriffShouldThankMe
AID00115484	Well, thank you so much, so very much, for ruining my life.
AID00115485	That's right - you SHOULD thank me.
AID00115486	BeagleSheriffStillLooking
AID00115487	I do thank you so kindly for your efforts.
AID00115488	I'm still looking.
AID00115489	BeagleSheriffGoodbye
AID00115490	But - but the town doesn't have a Sheriff! I don't have an employer, and that means I don't have a job.
AID00115491	If you think you might be able to help, come find me. I thank you for all you've done.
AID00115492	I'll be going now.
AID00115493	Maybe next time you can bring a new sheriff back with you!
AID00115494	Goodbye.
AID00115495	All right. Goodbye.
AID00115496	Goodbye.
AID00115497	BeagleSheriffBeagle
AID00115498	Oh no! I'm just the deputy. And I can't be a deputy without a sheriff. It's called chain of command!
AID00115499	What are you talking about? You're the sheriff now!
AID00115500	BeagleSheriffThanks
AID00115501	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AID00115502	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that - all new.
AID00115503	He's rude. Just don't tell him I said it. Primm has a sheriff now, just not as supportive as I would've hoped.
AID00115504	What's your problem now?
AID00115505	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AID00115506	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that: all new.
AID00115507	He's a good sheriff but a hard man. He doesn't abide by anyone slinking by the rules. I guess there won't be any trouble, but the man's law is hard.
AID00115508	What's your problem now?
AID00115509	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AID00115510	Slimm is alright, I don't wish him no harm, but the law to him is a set of logic.
AID00115511	Not everything is black and white, not sure a robot can ever understand that.
AID00115512	What's your problem now?
AID00115513	BeagleFleeingGoodbye
AID00115514	Thank you so much.
AID00115515	Okay.
AID00115516	PC says goodbye to hostage
AID00115517	I wonder what it's like to be able to "get going" whenever you like.
AID00115518	I've got to get going.
AID00115519	I certainly hope so. It gets lonely down here on the floor.
AID00115520	See you later.

AID00115540	Get outta my head!
AID00115541	PC asks about Harland
AID00115542	Any thoughts on where I might find some computer parts?
AID00115543	Any idea where I might be able to find nuclear material?
AID00115544	Where did you say I might find some computer parts again?
AID00115545	And I thought I was old. It's a junkshop east and slightly north of here. There's an old woman running it. Gilbert, or something.
AID00115546	Chris said you might know where I can find computer parts.
AID00115547	He did, did he? I swear, I should tear the rest of the hair out of that cocksucker's head.
AID00115548	Send a rescue mission after Harland? Nah, let's just send some smoothskin whose radio got broke!
AID00115549	Harland's tough! He probably enjoys waiting to be attacked at any moment! He probably loves eating nothing but roach meat!
AID00115550	Licking up condensation from a rusted pipe is his idea of fun! So's doing his business in a corner, and smelling it for days!
AID00115551	But oh, that's right - the crisis is that you need some computer parts! Well, you can go fuck yourself until you get my friends out of this mess.
AID00115552	FactoryRobotIDCheck
AID00115553	Go get them yourself, then.
AID00115554	Goodbye, Amata.
AID00115555	Why not come with me? There's nothing here for you anymore.
AID00115556	The door's open. You could come with me.
AID00115557	Time for me to go, Amata. My Dad's out there somewhere.
AID00115558	Goodbye, Amata. It's time for me to go.
AID00115559	You could come with me, you know. Leave this place behind forever.
AID00115560	Goodbye, Amata.
AID00115561	You should come with me. It's not safe for you to stay.
AID00115562	Goodbye, Amata.
AID00115563	Can I see what you have to trade?
AID00115564	Yes, unfortunately.
AID00115565	I see. Well, spare me the details.
AID00115566	Damn it, I'm going to miss that crooked, yellow smile...
AID00115567	All right, you did your part, so I'll do mine. Look around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
AID00115568	Are you all right? You sound... strange.
AID00115569	I am in command of my faculties! In command of my troops!
AID00115570	Antler guides me in all things! As I in turn guide my kin!
AID00115571	You can release the prisoners. I promise they're no threat.
AID00115572	Hey, I've been there! Those Super Mutants are all dead. It's safe now.
AID00115573	MS06SlaversDead
AID00115574	What kind of crap is this? I already knew about Rivet City!
AID00115575	I already know about Rivet City. I was hoping for a bit more.
AID00115576	Enough with the inane banter! Just tell me already.
AID00115577	I did my part. Now it's your turn to contribute to the Good Fight.

AID00115587	Okay, I'm just going to slowly walk away now...
AID00115588	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
AID00115589	Okay.
AID00115590	Actually I changed my mind. Let's stick together.
AID00115591	Your decisiveness is truly a wonder to behold, boss.
AID00115592	On second thought, you've been pretty useful so far. Forget what I said.
AID00115593	Mmm hm.

AID00115599	You sure now? All right.
AID00115600	Either shoot or don't, but don't be wishing and washing about it.
AID00115601	You're like a switchblade stuck on flick.
AID00115602	Going to give a lightswitch a run for its money. Click click click.
AID00115603	Oh, pumpkin, you make grandma so happy!
AID00115604	Excellent. Will do.
AID00115605	On second thought, stay with me.
AID00115606	Yes, I'm sure.
AID00115607	All right. Guess I'll be around Novac for a while longer, until I figure out what I want to do with myself. See you around.
AID00115608	Yeah, that's what I think. You should head back home.
AID00115609	That's why you're the boss. You always make the right decisions. I'll just head home. Home to my lonely, abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.
AID00115610	I think it's for the best.
AID00115611	Okay. Then I guess I'll be back at the 188. Maybe digging in some dirt for scrap metal or something.
AID00115612	I just think we should right now.
AID00115613	<Makes beeping sounds>

AID00115615	I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.

AID00115617	Fine then.
AID00115618	I'll get out of your hair, then.
AID00115619	All right, then, dearie. Now you promise to come visit grandma soon, you hear?
AID00115620	I'll miss you too, Lily, but it's time.
AID00115621	MegProtectronTalkEntry1
AID00115622	I found Argyle. I'm afraid he's dead.
AID00115623	Tell me about Argyle.
AID00115624	You mentioned something about GNR?
AID00115625	I saw the Family's mark on the wall. What's up with that?
AID00115626	Let's talk about something else.
AID00115627	Do you really believe in vampires?
AID00115628	Did you ever talk to your parents about it?
AID00115629	What did Lucy say she saw you do to that Wastelander?
AID00115630	When did you first discover you had the hunger?
AID00115631	Would you mind if I asked about your unusual hunger?
AID00115632	No, thanks.
AID00115633	In that case, stand just like that for a second. I want to make some toast.
AID00115634	Suit yourself.
AID00115635	All right, but don't blame me if you end up sterile.
AID00115636	Whatever you say. Hey, is that a little patch of ghoul rot on your cheek there?
AID00115637	Suit yourself. I'm sure there are ghouls and other mutants who once said the same thing.
AID00115638	If that's the way you want it, it's all the same to me.
AID00115639	Do it.
AID00115640	Okay. And remember, if this doesn't help, try taking a bath in tomato juice.
AID00115641	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00115642	Okay... all done.
AID00115643	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00115644	Just stand still and try to ignore the tingling.
AID00115645	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00115646	This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
AID00115647	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00115648	I bet you could make some of the money letting people work on their tans next to you.
AID00115649	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115650	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
AID00115651	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115652	Well, if you scrounge it up, the help is here waiting for you.
AID00115653	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115654	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
AID00115655	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115656	Here we go. You'll be rad-free in no time.
AID00115657	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00115658	Then I can't help, sorry. Just following protocol.
AID00115659	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115660	Then I can't help you. Sorry.
AID00115661	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00115662	And a quick shot... all done.
AID00115663	Can you heal my radiation?
AID00115664	Sure can. Quick and easy.
AID00115665	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AID00115666	Are you sure? You won't be able to read in the dark as well.
AID00115667	Sure. I can help you out.
AID00115668	Well, one thing we do have is a good supply of Rad-Away. Sure, I can help you with that.
AID00115669	No, sorry, we're totally unprepared to deal with radiation sickness.
AID00115670	Ha ha, just kidding, of course I can!
AID00115671	We always make sure to keep an ample supply of Rad-Away. Most of us haven't had the exposure outsiders like you take for granted.
AID00115672	Who the hell are you supposed to be?
AID00115673	Wait, you're Ian West? I have this letter for you from your sister!
AID00115674	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
AID00115675	Are you a prisoner here or something?
AID00115676	Looks like I'm breaking you out of your cell...
AID00115677	What the hell is your problem?
AID00115678	I have no clue what you're talking about.
AID00115679	Calm down, Ian. Tell me everything from the beginning.
AID00115680	Is there someplace I can sleep?
AID00115681	Let's trade.
AID00115682	What's with all the names? Bob, Herbert and Harold? I don't get it.
AID00115683	I'm not a charity. You want to die, cough up some caps.
AID00115684	You're mostly a tree, right? Can't I just burn you down?
AID00115685	I'd like a haircut please.
AID00115686	Certainly. I am programmed with a multitude of hair shaping scenarios, if you would care to choose one, I would be happy to replicate it for you.

AID00115694	What happened down here?
AID00115695	Where can I rent a bed?
AID00115696	I'm the one who saved the kids from Paradise Falls.
AID00115697	What can you tell me about Mabel Henderson?
AID00115698	Sorry, sounds like suicide. Be my guest.
AID00115699	Start from the beginning.
AID00115700	Tell me what's going on and I'll see if I can help.
AID00115701	Your team's still alive... I heard their distress signal!
AID00115702	I saved the Vault, and now you're kicking me out?
AID00115703	I understand. Goodbye, Amata.

AID00115707	Look, anything else you can do to help might save lives.
AID00115708	Will's dad was scary? How so?
AID00115709	How about Will's parents?
AID00115710	So, you and Will were good friends?
AID00115711	Where did the Brandices live?
AID00115712	About the other people from Grayditch...
AID00115713	Tell me about the Brandice Family.
AID00115714	Tell me about this "Doc Lesko."
AID00115715	Mind if I ask about some of the people who lived here?
AID00115716	MQ04BettyWhistling
AID00115717	I heard you bake really tasty pies. Can you make one for me?
AID00115718	MQ04Soldier1
AID00115719	Dad? Is that really you?
AID00115720	You want help? Fork over some caps, Einstein.
AID00115721	Books aren't going to buy me new ammunition.
AID00115722	No reward needed Doc, I'll be glad to help.
AID00115723	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
AID00115724	You know what, keep your caps and I'll tell Moriarty you're gone.
AID00115725	This is a hefty task, Doc. I'm going to need serious incentive.
AID00115726	So you want me to pop the Queen, huh?
AID00115727	Why not just kill the Queen and be done with it?
AID00115728	If the Queen's your concern, why not deal with it directly?
AID00115729	So? It's your mistake Doc, you fix it.
AID00115730	What exactly do you need?
AID00115731	What can I do to help?

AID00115734	This will stop the Fire Ants?
AID00115735	I hope that's everything, I've had enough of ants.
AID00115736	Just how will all this undo the mayhem you've caused?
AID00115737	I found him, actually... inside Marigold Metro.
AID00115738	Do you trust Lesko?
AID00115739	Before Lesko showed up, were there ever ants in Grayditch?
AID00115740	Did your pappa ever tell you what he thought of Lesko?
AID00115741	Mind if I ask you some important stuff about Doctor Lesko?
AID00115742	Haven't found a thing. (Lie)
AID00115743	I know where the Ant Queen lives.
AID00115744	Don't worry, Bryan... I think I know how to take care of these ants.
AID00115745	All the ants are dead so I'm done here. Go home.
AID00115746	It's a slave collar, I sold your dumb ass for caps.
AID00115747	Something to remember me by. It'll lead you home.
AID00115748	It's a Paradise Welcome Necklace. It'll help you find your way, you lucky devil!
AID00115749	Sure did. It's a beautiful place called Paradise Falls. Here, put this on.
AID00115750	I found a place with lots of kids your age. I'll tell you how to get there.
AID00115751	I sure did, Bryan. Vera said she'd take you in!
AID00115752	Actually, I give up. I can't find anywhere that will take you in.
AID00115753	Actually, I'm not ready yet.
AID00115754	I'd like the Ant Sight to increase my perception.
AID00115755	I'd like the Ant Might to increase my physical strength.
AID00115756	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection and Lab Coat, Doctor.
AID00115757	Your theories were in error, and beyond correction. I had no choice.
AID00115758	Because you're out of your mind!
AID00115759	I can't let you risk people's lives for an experiment.
AID00115760	It was for the greater good Lesko. Man is not ready to play God.
AID00115761	I've killed the Ant Queen and I destroyed your mutagen supply.
AID00115762	I've killed all of the Nest Guardians, but I destroyed your mutagen supply.
AID00115763	Actually, my mistake... I'm not done yet.
AID00115764	I've killed all the Nest Guardians [Lie]
AID00115765	My work is done, Doctor.
AID00115766	I've killed all the Nest Guardians.
AID00115767	I've destroyed your mutagen sample.
AID00115768	What kind of work do you do in here?
AID00115769	What are you doing here in this wrecked part of the ship?
AID00115770	I抦 sorry about this, I really am. But it抯 true. You抮e not human.
AID00115771	You were made to look and act human. But you抮e not. The evidence proves that.
AID00115772	It抯 not real blood, Harkness. It抯 synthetic, just like everything else.
AID00115773	I need to know more about what I'm dealing with. What is an android exactly?
AID00115774	So tell me about the Commonwealth.

AID00115786	That's wonderful, kid. Now scram.
AID00115787	Calm down, calm down. Just who the heck are you?

AID00115798	Don't you realize you've ruined his entire life?
AID00115799	Can't you take responsibility for his father's death?
AID00115800	Who the hell is Bryan Wilks?
AID00115801	Wilks? I have no idea what you mean.
AID00115802	I'd be glad to help him. Who is he?
AID00115803	You've betrayed Doctor Li, and my father.
AID00115804	Have you seen my dad?
AID00115805	Never mind. I'll be going.
AID00115806	Tell me more about this place.
AID00115807	Who are you?
AID00115808	What have you done with my father?
AID00115809	I just wanted to say thanks, and good luck.
AID00115810	I changed my mind. I'll do it. I'll put in the code.
AID00115811	Sorry, I didn't expect to bump into anyone alive down here.
AID00115812	Hey, it's none of my business.
AID00115813	What are you doing now?
AID00115814	Why do you think the Enclave attacked Project Purity?
AID00115815	Where can I buy more things for my place?
AID00115816	No, thanks.
AID00115817	Sure, I'll take it!
AID00115818	I'll take it for 50 caps.
AID00115819	You got any snake oil in there as well?
AID00115820	How is it better than a regular Nuka-Cola?
AID00115821	Shut up and make some sense!
AID00115822	Who's burning what?
AID00115823	Calm down! Let me try and help you.
AID00115824	The Wasteland is as dead as you're going to be if you don't tell me the truth!
AID00115825	What are you, crazy or something?
AID00115826	What is it? What did you see?
AID00115827	My mistake. I thought you were someone else.
AID00115828	Life sucks, then you die. You may as well get that through your thick skull.
AID00115829	Happy? Sure, I guess you could call it that.
AID00115830	I've been worried about you. You don't exactly seem cut out for this place.
AID00115831	Now that's what I call payment.
AID00115832	Wow, thanks!
AID00115833	I don't know what to say. What do I owe ya?
AID00115834	What are you doing, following me?
AID00115835	No problem. What are you doing out here?
AID00115836	Donovan! What are you doing in these parts?
AID00115837	HD00JukeboxRadioMusic
AID00115838	Did you say a city of Ghouls?
AID00115839	"Other assholes"?
AID00115840	I'm not a tourist...
AID00115841	You're crazy to stand out here! Aren't you afraid of the Super Mutants?
AID00115842	Um... Where the hell did you come from?
AID00115843	What does the Nuka-Cola machine dispense?
AID00115844	The Nuka-Cola machine will dispense Ice Cold Nuka-Cola.
AID00115845	Once you've dispensed 8 of them, the machine will have to be restocked in order to make regular Nuka-Colas ice cold.
AID00115846	Can you explain what the Workbench is for?
AID00115847	If you come across any schematics in the Wasteland, you'll be able to construct its contents on this specially designed table.
AID00115848	What does my Jukebox do?
AID00115849	Just switch on the Jukebox, and instantly the room will fill with music to keep you entertained.
AID00115850	The music selections have been hand picked by none other than Three Dog of Galaxy News Radio.
AID00115851	Can you explain how the My First Laboratory works?
AID00115852	From the keen minds at Med-Tek, the My First Laboratory will instantly detoxify you, removing any nasty addictions from your body.
AID00115853	If you're feeling the need to experiment, just set the lab to "brew" and a day later, it will produce a random useful compound.
AID00115854	Remember that while the lab is brewing, you can't use the detoxify functions.
AID00115855	Can you explain how the My First Infirmary works?
AID00115856	An innovation from Med-Tek, the My First Infirmary will automatically diagnose and treat any injury you might sustain.
AID00115857	It will also make any of the pesky rads you've accumulated in the Wasteland vanish instantly.
AID00115858	What's with those things behind the glass?
AID00115859	Blessings to you, too. Surely, you would care to give a tithe for that wisdom?
AID00115860	I never meant it like all that. It's just supposed to help you stay alive.
AID00115861	No. Why don't you tell me about it? <Lie>
AID00115862	Read it? I helped write it!
AID00115863	You must be crazy. It's never a good day out here.
AID00115864	Why are you so happy?
AID00115865	Actually, I helped write that book.
AID00115866	Two meals a day doesn't sound like much.
AID00115867	Oh, I am hunting. I'm hunting what you've got.
AID00115868	Maybe the book's fine, and you're just an idiot.
AID00115869	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it really that bad?
AID00115870	Actually, I helped write that book.
AID00115871	Book? What book?
AID00115872	Just be glad you're still alive.
AID00115873	What book?
AID00115874	FFEU21Topic
AID00115875	Fine, I like it better up here than I ever did down there.
AID00115876	Well, don't let me hold you up.
AID00115877	I miss her, too. Give my warmest regards to the Vault, would you?
AID00115878	Doesn't really make a difference to me. I was exiled, remember?
AID00115879	So, does that mean I can come back?
AID00115880	I never expected to see you out here, either. I'm surprised you're alive.
AID00115881	Good to see you, Susie! Looks like you're doing well.
AID00115882	I've got to go now.
AID00115883	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
AID00115884	I'm not the killing type.
AID00115885	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
AID00115886	Let's talk about something else.
AID00115887	DialogOasisHaroldTreeminders04
AID00115888	Which Treeminder do you get along with the best?
AID00115889	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
AID00115890	Did you ever ask one of them to kill you?
AID00115891	About those Treeminders...
AID00115892	Nevermind.
AID00115893	What, just give it to you? Hell no.
AID00115894	I knew it was too good to be true... there are no good souls in the Wasteland.
AID00115895	Go. Just leave me alone to die...
AID00115896	I... I understand. You have to look out for yourself.
AID00115897	Just leave me...
AID00115898	I insist, my friend. It's the least I can do to help.
AID00115899	Really? Seriously? My God. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll never forget this!
AID00115900	Water... precious water... thank you! You're a saint!
AID00115901	My... thank you. Thank you so much. You've saved my life. Bless you.

AID00115903	WaterBeggarGreetingEND
AID00115904	No. Find your own water.
AID00115905	Oh... I guess that's understandable. Got to watch out for numero uno and all.
AID00115906	Just leave me...
AID00115907	I... I understand. You have to look out for yourself.
AID00115908	Just leave me...

AID00115913	You... are you serious? I can't offer anything in exchange, you know?
AID00115914	I can just have it? For free?
AID00115915	Here. Have this Purified Water.
AID00115916	I've been drinking whatever I can find, but I can't do it anymore. I need purified water.
AID00115917	Please... if you find any...
AID00115918	All I have is irradiated water.
AID00115919	Please, if you find some... please...
AID00115920	I'm sorry. I don't have any water to give you.
AID00115921	Will any water do?
AID00115922	I've been drinking this irradiated shit and... I can't do it. I just throw it up now. I need purified water... please...

AID00115930	Do you sell any specialty items?
AID00115931	If this android "wandered" off, why would he want a new mind and face?
AID00115932	Okay, so if others have escaped... why are you coming after this one?
AID00115933	Why would an android feel guilt? Come on, Zimmer, what aren't you telling me?
AID00115934	Well, you found me. Now try and kill me, tough guy.
AID00115935	The Nuka-Cola Corporation had her killed! (Lie)
AID00115936	Yeah, it's a shame. She was beautiful.
AID00115937	Where was Vault 87 again?
AID00115938	My father was looking for something called a G.E.C.K. Do you have one?
AID00115939	What the hell just happened?
AID00115940	The gate's open. Run for it!
AID00115941	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
AID00115942	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
AID00115943	You're forcing me to do things against my nature, and I hate you for it.
AID00115944	I don't want to do this... But I will.
AID00115945	So it's not yours? Oops.
AID00115946	What am I supposed to be doing again?
AID00115947	Zimmer thought you were an android. Don't worry, I set him straight.
AID00115948	The android is dead. See, here's an internal component. <Lie.>
AID00115949	So what's this stuff you gave me, these are... android guts?
AID00115950	Do you know this android personally?
AID00115951	Tell me more about you. You help androids escape?
AID00115952	Really, I just kinda stumbled onto all of this. I'm mostly just curious is all.
AID00115953	I wonder who wants the android more... care to put a price on the android?
AID00115954	Look, I'm just trying to find out more so I can help this android.
AID00115955	Clearly I'm onto something important. What's your stake in all of this?
AID00115956	The Commonwealth? What's that?
AID00115957	My interest in the android is none of your business.

AID00115960	There's something you aren't telling me. Isn't there?
AID00115961	What if this evidence doesn't work? What if Harkness doesn't believe me?
AID00115962	Harkness should be told. You'd want to know if you were an android.
AID00115963	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
AID00115964	Welcome back to reality, you filthy android. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
AID00115965	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
AID00115966	What do you know about the Commonwealth?
AID00115967	What do you know about this android Railroad?
AID00115968	So why'd you help the android?
AID00115969	So what do I call you, now? Harkness or A3-21?
AID00115970	Well... now that you know the truth. What are you going to do?
AID00115971	So why did you do go ahead with the change? Was it worth it?
AID00115972	CitTalkAtEase.
AID00115973	CitTalkHail.
AID00115974	If I help you, is there some kind of reward?
AID00115975	Anything else I should know?
AID00115976	Can I join the Railroad?
AID00115977	What about human slaves? Don't you try to help them, too?
AID00115978	What's this "movement" you mentioned?
AID00115979	This conversation's over, Ms. Watts. Now step aside.
AID00115980	What would you have me do?

AID00116000	Sure, here you go.
AID00116001	I bumped into him a while back is all. (Lie)
AID00116002	I found him dead.
AID00116003	I have a package for you from him.
AID00116004	Do you know someone named Grady?

AID00116006	I'm keeping it, and I'd advise you to back off before I get angry!
AID00116007	Come and get it from me, if you think you can.
AID00116008	No way, it's mine!
AID00116009	How about you pay me for it?
AID00116010	Okay... okay. Here. No need for violence.
AID00116011	So my father's okay? I can... get him back?
AID00116012	So... I'm free to leave?
AID00116013	Tell me about the G.E.C.K.
AID00116014	Tell me exactly who you are. Who you really are.
AID00116015	Tell me about this place, about Tranquility Lane.
AID00116016	I came here for my father. Now where is he?
AID00116017	You'll just reset everything anyway. Who cares?
AID00116018	It's all over. Now shut up, and answer my questions.
AID00116019	I'm calling the shots now!
AID00116020	Are you kidding? If you get out, you can have all the booze you want!
AID00116021	You're hopeless. Forget it.
AID00116022	What's the deal with Barrett?
AID00116023	Can I buy some Ultrajet?
AID00116024	Have you ever heard of The Family?
AID00116025	Here's all the Sugar Bombs I've got.
AID00116026	Let me think about it a bit.
AID00116027	Make it 30 caps each and you got yourself a deal.
AID00116028	Alright, Murphy... I'm in.
AID00116029	No way. I'm not helping you make chems!
AID00116030	Nothing's free in this world, Murphy.
AID00116031	That's it, Butch. You and me. Right now.
AID00116032	Yeah sure, what do you need?
AID00116033	Stop trying to talk your way out of this, zombie!
AID00116034	What the heck are you talking about?
AID00116035	Ultrajet? That some sort of super chem?
AID00116036	Yeah sure, I'm here for everything you got. Hand it over, zombie!
AID00116037	What secrets?

AID00116041	I changed my mind. I'll go with you to Rivet City.
AID00116042	Can I think about it?
AID00116043	Screw it, I'm going for the faceoff!
AID00116044	Make it 400 caps and it's all yours.
AID00116045	Fine, I'll take it.

AID00116049	Okay, if you say so.
AID00116050	I think you've taken a few too many blows to the head, weirdo!
AID00116051	What's with the masks, anyway?
AID00116052	Who are you and why are you talking like that?
AID00116053	Hey, take it easy, I was just passing through.
AID00116054	None of your damn business!

AID00116058	Who was this "Master" you served?
AID00116059	Maybe you missed it. Can I come up and look?

AID00116086	Just because.
AID00116087	You just... did it? Just like that, on a whim?
AID00116088	Well listen, sir, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
AID00116089	Will there be anything else?

AID00116091	Well listen, ma'am, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
AID00116092	Will there be anything else?
AID00116093	Seemed like a good idea at the time.
AID00116094	She missed my wake-up call.
AID00116095	I- I'm sorry to hear that. She's a nice woman. Was. She might've grown on you.
AID00116096	She's usually real good about those calls. Something must've happened.
AID00116097	I hope just because I said she and I were friends doesn't mean you and I can't still be friendly.
AID00116098	Will there be anything else?
AID00116099	That's my business.
AID00116100	Lord almighty. I can't for the life of me imagine her doing anything that'd make someone want to kill her.
AID00116101	Not that I'm saying you're a liar, of course! I'm just surprised, is all.
AID00116102	Will there be anything else?
AID00116103	Personal favor.
AID00116104	She had it coming.
AID00116105	I killed Jeannie May. Do I still get my discount?
AID00116106	Ki- killed her? Why would you do something like that?
AID00116107	Jeannie May sent me.
AID00116108	Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
AID00116109	They see the sign and think, gift shop? That's just too good to be true. But Jeannie May always points them back in my direction.
AID00116110	Well, a friend of Jeannie's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
AID00116111	What do you think of the people who live here?
AID00116112	Oh, we keep to ourselves, for the most part. Try not to pry. I think Jeannie May gets bothered that we aren't more sociable, but it's just our way.
AID00116113	Ain't that we don't appreciate what she's done, managing this town like she has, but I worry she feels that way anyhow.
AID00116114	Not that there ain't others who pry around here. That No-bark was skulking around our yard last week.
AID00116115	<Laughs> I thought he was our cow-killer. Was about to lash him with our bullwhip till I saw who it was.  He's harmless, though.
AID00116116	Part of me wishes I could see things like he sees 'em, all full of mystery.
AID00116117	I just wanted to meet you.
AID00116118	Oh! Well I'm Alice and you've already met my beau, Dusty. He's sweet, ain't he? I don't care what my mama said, I know how to pick 'em.
AID00116119	Oh! Well I'm Alice and that handsome stranger yonder is my husband Dusty. Going on fifty years, now.
AID00116120	I keep waiting for him to leave me for some young thing with platinum blonde hair and hoop earrings, but he still sticks around.
AID00116121	Says it's my cooking. I think it's because I know which Brahmin udder you can milk without getting kicked in the noggin.
AID00116122	We set up this ranch years back when Novac was just getting settled.
AID00116123	But now with all the danger on I-15, folks are starting to come through here from all over. Novac might just be the next Nevada boom town.
AID00116124	PC will keep working on current task
AID00116125	All right. Carry on.
AID00116126	I'll stick with my current task.
AID00116127	PC reports nightkin gone
AID00116128	PC says he wants to help
AID00116129	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need a quantity of the igniting agent.
AID00116130	What else do you need?
AID00116131	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need the thrust control modules.
AID00116132	What else do you need?
AID00116133	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need to get them ready for launch. I still need a quantity of the igniting agent and the thrust control modules.
AID00116134	For the fuel source, any shielded nuclear waste should do the trick. That's why we can't use the waste on the launch pad. Too much decay.
AID00116135	As for the computer parts, the thruster control systems aren't complicated, so any good mix of components is all I need.
AID00116136	What else do you need?
AID00116137	I was close to completing work on the rockets before we were driven into hiding on the top floor.
AID00116138	Two components were missing: a quantity of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
AID00116139	The igniting agent is highly radioactive, and decays quickly. That's why we can't use the drums that leaked down on the launch pad.
AID00116140	It's no longer potent enough. I need you to find an intact, shielded container of the igniting agent.
AID00116141	As for the thrust control modules, they were custom-built for these rockets. They won't even launch without them.
AID00116142	How can I help?
AID00116143	As I said before, I need an intact, shielded container of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
AID00116144	How can I help?
AID00116145	PC asks for task tips
AID00116146	REPCONN has been ransacked so many times by scavengers, it's hard to know where the components might turn up. IF they turn up.
AID00116147	Jason has mentioned some industrial ruins to the east that are supposed to be highly radioactive.
AID00116148	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
AID00116149	I'd start by visiting local junk merchants or traders and see if that turns anything up.
AID00116150	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
AID00116151	Scavengers wouldn't know the value of the modules just by looking at them. If you know any junk dealers in the area, I'd start there.
AID00116152	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
AID00116153	I'll try to find the parts you need.
AID00116154	All right. Anything else?
AID00116155	I'll track down the thrust control modules.
AID00116156	PC offers to find fuel for rockets
AID00116157	Very well. We don't need a huge amount. Two to three liters should be enough.
AID00116158	I'll track down the igniting agent.
AID00116159	PC offers to get rid of nightkin
AID00116160	PC asks for help with different task
AID00116161	All right. What would you rather be doing?
AID00116162	Actually, I'd like to help with something else.
AID00116163	All right. What would you rather be doing?
AID00116164	Actually, I'd like to help with something else.

AID00116195	Who is Antler? WHO IS ANTLER?
AID00116196	Antler, the human asks about you! What do I tell it? All right.
AID00116197	All right... Yes, yes, of course.
AID00116198	Who Antler is, not important to you. Antler wants that you deal with me.
AID00116199	Who is "Antler"?
AID00116200	Cut it out, human. Serious. Final warning.
AID00116201	Is "Antler" the Brahmin skull over there?
AID00116202	You did it now! Antler's horns stabbing! Antler MAD!

AID00116207	Well, good luck with that! I'd give you a hand, but no thanks. I may look like a corpse, but I'm partial to living!
AID00116208	Jason sent me down here to get rid of the "demons."
AID00116209	A stash of Stealth Boys. Are you kidding me?
AID00116210	If there was some big stash of devices in here that made you invisible, do you really think we'd be having this conversation?
AID00116211	I'm looking for a stash of StealthBoys in this room.
AID00116212	The only thing you'll find up here is a bullet hole between your eyes. Got any better ideas?
AID00116213	Can I come up there and look? Maybe you missed the Stealth Boys.
AID00116214	Maybe you noticed a bunch of invisible monsters out there? I've been in here trying not to get dead.
AID00116215	I'm exploring, that's all. What about you?
AID00116216	Well, saints alive. That is a load off. Nothing to be done, though. Those ghouls just didn't know when they weren't wanted. Couldn't take a hint.
AID00116217	And aren't you just the most unexpected gift our little town ever had? Here, take this. And go buy yourself something nice.
AID00116218	I killed the  ghouls at REPCONN.
AID00116219	Leave? I don't believe that was what was discussed. They could be back tomorrow knocking on my door wanting hand-outs.
AID00116220	I'm sorry, I know what I promised, but my mind is just not at ease about this. I'm afraid I can't pay you for what you done.
AID00116221	I got the ghouls to leave the area. They won't be bothering you anymore.

AID00116243	ChrisHavLabBetraySugarBombs
AID00116244	I said I need three boxes of Sugar Bombs, not less than three.
AID00116245	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
AID00116246	I'll mix the Sugar Bombs into the fuel mixture before they launch. They'll never suspect a thing... until it's too late.
AID00116247	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
AID00116248	I'll mix the Sugar Bombs into the fuel mixture before they launch. They'll never suspect a thing... until it's too late.
AID00116249	But first I'll need the other parts we talked about.
AID00116250	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
AID00116251	ChrisHavLabBetrayedSabotageYes
AID00116252	The PC talks Chris out of sabotage
AID00116253	What, you think I'm too stupid to pull it off? I know enough to get their rockets working, don't I? So I can make them fail, too!
AID00116254	That'd be murder, Chris. And you're no murderer.
AID00116255	Like I could forgive myself for getting duped like this? They used me! And now they'll throw me away!
AID00116256	It's not a matter of smarts. You'd never forgive yourself.
AID00116257	And dying would be worse than this? Used up and thrown away like garbage?
AID00116258	They'd take you if they could, Chris, but you'd die.
AID00116259	Oh, so I've redeemed the human race, is that it? What a crock! The human race can't stand me!
AID00116260	They're going to revere you as a Saint, Chris!
AID00116261	So you want me to accompany you on your adventures across the wasteland, is that it?
AID00116262	That's not true, Chris. You're all right.
AID00116263	Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
AID00116264	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got.
AID00116265	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. I'll get Jason and his flock on their way, and then I'll head for Novac.
AID00116266	There's a little town called Novac down the road.
AID00116267	Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
AID00116268	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got. Maybe it'll be different this time. I was never a Saint before.
AID00116269	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. You go launch the rockets. I'm on my way to Novac.
AID00116270	There's a little town called Novac down the road.
AID00116271	Come to think of it, sabotage is a great idea.
AID00116272	Then bring me Sugar Bombs. Three boxes should do the trick. Add those to the fuel mixture and "Boom!"
AID00116273	I'll show those rotten ghouls! And they'll know exactly who did them in!
AID00116274	Then bring me Sugar Bombs. Three boxes should do the trick. Add those to the fuel mixture and "Boom!"

AID00116276	ChrisHavBetrayalSabotage
AID00116277	ChrisHavLabWhatDoYouDo
AID00116278	I'm the flock's resident engineer. I've always been good with machines. Jason says the Great Journey would've been impossible without me.
AID00116279	Of course, my skills aren't much use unless I have the right materials. That's where you come in.
AID00116280	What do you do here?
AID00116281	When I joined the flock, Jason made it clear that he wanted me to supervise the repairs, not do them myself.
AID00116282	It would be a waste of my gifts to work on just one system at a time. From up here, I've been able to supervise the entire project.
AID00116283	Why don't they let you work down on the launch pad?
AID00116284	I thought we were past all that, smoothskin. But you just can't resist the chance to mess with me. Typical human.
AID00116285	I was human once, you know. Grew up in Vault 34, northeast of here.
AID00116286	Nice upbringing, if you like assault rifles and target practice. But oh, you prefer machines that don't shoot people? Not so nice then.
AID00116287	Who should maintain the Vault's reactor? Houser? Mitchell? No - make it Haversam. He likes machines!
AID00116288	Haversam won't mind getting irradiated! Haversam won't mind mutating! He's already ugly as it is!
AID00116289	Haversam won't mind when his hair starts falling out after a few years. There's no connection, Haversam! You're neurotic!
AID00116290	The radiation down there would kill you, Chris. Because you're human.
AID00116291	Bald? You call this bald, smoothskin? I'm a monster! A monster!
AID00116292	You left your Vault because you were going bald?
AID00116293	Stop making fun of me! But you're telling the truth, aren't you?
AID00116294	Oh no! How could they do this to me? For two years? My god, I've been a joke to them!
AID00116295	Do you have any idea how easy it'd be for me to sabotage those rockets? That'd be a joke, huh? One hell of a joke!
AID00116296	Honey, you're no monster. You're cute! Why, I could just about eat you up!
AID00116297	[SUCCEEDED] Oh god! You're telling me the truth, aren't you...?
AID00116298	Oh no! How could they do this to me? For two years? My god, I've been a joke to them!
AID00116299	Do you have any idea how easy it'd be for me to sabotage those rockets? That'd be a joke, huh? One hell of a joke!
AID00116300	Jason told me himself. The Great Journey is for ghouls only. You're not going.
AID00116301	[FAILED] I see your ploy, smoothskin. I won't fall for your trap. You can plainly see that I'm a ghoul myself. You can't turn me against my flock.
AID00116302	You wouldn't trust a ghoul, would you?
AID00116303	ChrisHavLabGoodbye
AID00116304	All right. I'll be here, obviously.
AID00116305	I need to be going.
AID00116306	Fine. Just get me those Sugar Bombs.
AID00116307	I need to be going.
AID00116308	Come back when you've found the igniting agent.
AID00116309	I need to be going.
AID00116310	Come back when you've tracked down the thrust control modules.
AID00116311	I need to be going.
AID00116312	Great, let's do everything when it's convenient for you.
AID00116313	Let me get back to you.
AID00116314	ChrisHavLabWhatIsThisPlace
AID00116315	Obviously. It's taken months, but I've nearly got them in working order. Soon they'll take us to the Far Beyond.
AID00116316	I was skeptical at first, of course - being a man of science - but Jason is certain, and I believe in Jason.
AID00116317	So the "Great Journey" will use those rockets?
AID00116318	ChrisHavIntercomGoodbye
AID00116319	Let's hope you do.
AID00116320	Got it.
AID00116321	Stop wasting time.
AID00116322	Sure.
AID00116323	Get moving.
AID00116324	All right.
AID00116325	ChrisHavUpsWhoIsJason
AID00116326	Jason is the prophet. The only reason you're up here is because he wants to talk to you.
AID00116327	I guess he had visions that a smoothskin would stop by.
AID00116328	Who is Jason?
AID00116329	ChrisHavUpsGoodbye
AID00116330	Stay away from me.
AID00116331	I guess I'll be going.
AID00116332	Good riddance.
AID00116333	I guess I'll be going.
AID00116334	Good idea.
AID00116335	I guess I'll be going.
AID00116336	ChrisHavUpsHello
AID00116337	Your pranks won't work on me, smoothskin. They won't work on Jason, either.
AID00116338	Hey, you're not a ghoul!
AID00116339	Stop wasting my time, smoothskin. Go waste Jason's.
AID00116340	Smoothskin? Your skin looks pretty smooth to me.
AID00116341	ChrisHavIntercomWhere
AID00116342	Like I said, find the metal staircase in the big room on the east side of the building. It's where they used to make rockets.
AID00116343	Where are you located?
AID00116344	Big room. Metal staircase. East side of the building. Is that too many syllables for you?
AID00116345	Tell me again how to find you.
AID00116346	ChrisHavIntercomFeralGhouls
AID00116347	ChrisHavIntercomWho
AID00116348	Who I am doesn't matter, smoothskin. Stop wasting time and get up here.
AID00116349	Who are you?
AID00116350	PC asks about the Great Journey
AID00116351	We wish to escape the barbarity of the wasteland, especially the violence and bigotry of its human inhabitants.
AID00116352	The creator has promised to my flock a new land: a place of safety and healing... a paradise in the Far Beyond.
AID00116353	Preparations for the Great Journey were nearly complete when the demons appeared.
AID00116354	What's the "Great Journey"?
AID00116355	The means by which the Great Journey is to be accomplished are an article of faith, not to be discussed with outsiders.
AID00116356	How will you make the "Journey?"
AID00116357	Yes. The rockets will convey us to our promised land in the Far Beyond. Vision upon vision has confirmed it.
AID00116358	Are you seriously going to make your "Great Journey" on those rockets?
AID00116359	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
AID00116360	Are these surface-to-surface rockets? Or will they launch you into orbit?
AID00116361	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
AID00116362	Those rockets will convey you and your flock straight into the ground!
AID00116363	JasonBrightNovacGhoulicide
AID00116364	I wish I could say I was surprised. But that is what we've come to expect from your kind.
AID00116365	Normally, it's what I'd expect from you. But it was the creator who brought you here today.
AID00116366	Some folks in Novac want you dead, and will pay to have it done.
AID00116367	JasonBrightGoodbye
AID00116368	PC will not alert Chris H
AID00116369	Chris shall be declared the Saint of the Great Journey before we depart. I hope this will ease his sadness...
AID00116370	Well, it's none of my business.
AID00116371	JasonBrightChrisDisapprove
AID00116372	It is the creator's will, and I must submit. There is no malice in it. We would take him with us if we could.
AID00116373	You've been using Chris. It's despicable.
AID00116374	JasonBrightWhoIsCult
AID00116375	JasonBrightWhoAreYou
AID00116376	I am Jason Bright, the prophet of the Great Journey. All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
AID00116377	Who are you?
AID00116378	An auspicious name, don't you think? It was mine before I became as I am now. Before the Great War, even.
AID00116379	Truly does the creator author a destiny for each and every one of us...
AID00116380	Your last name is "Bright?" That's funny.
AID00116381	JasonBright
AID00116382	JasonBrightSpeech9
AID00116383	Seekers, board the rockets, take your seats. The Great Journey awaits! To the promised land we go! To the Far Beyond!
AID00116384	JasonBrightSpeech8
AID00116385	I ask that you forgive us, Chris, and give us your blessing, and we bestow ours upon you.
AID00116386	JasonBrightSpeech7
AID00116387	From this moment forward, you will be remembered as the Saint of the Great Journey. We shall never forget you.
AID00116388	JasonBrightSpeech6
AID00116389	But to Chris, we owe more than thanks. Chris, you have made this Great Journey a reality.
AID00116390	JasonBrightSpeech5
AID00116391	To our new friend, we say thanks, and promise never to forget how he cleared from our path the demons who sought to stay our Journey.
AID00116392	Did you make the training VR yourself?
AID00116393	Not far from it. When we reclaimed this bunker, I found a number of VR tapes. Most were corrupted, but a few programs still ran.
AID00116394	Using those as my foundation, I was able to code the training VR, as well as other applications.
AID00116395	Player tries to use Speech to learn about NCR activities
AID00116396	[SUCCEEDED] Hold on there! With everything you already done for this town, I'd feel ungrateful as hell if I let you risk yourself for no good reason!
AID00116397	He made me swear not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
AID00116398	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
AID00116399	If the NCR won't deal with those prisoners, I'll have to risk doing it myself.
AID00116400	[SUCCEEDED] No need to get upset, youngster! We're all friends here!
AID00116401	I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
AID00116402	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
AID00116403	I only ask politely the first time, old man. Now tell me.
AID00116404	[FAILED] Sorry, youngster. I'm a trader, and if something's got value, I can't give it away for nothing.
AID00116405	Um, tell me free or... I mean, can't you just tell me? Please?
AID00116406	No thanks.
AID00116407	If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
AID00116408	No, but it's worth 50 caps.
AID00116409	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that'll do.
AID00116410	I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
AID00116411	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
AID00116412	I could see giving you 50 caps, maybe.
AID00116413	[FAILED] Then I guess you won't be knowing more, eh? But you know where to find me, should you change your mind.
AID00116414	No way I'd pay more than 20 caps to know more.
AID00116415	Any idea what the NCR's up to in Primm?
AID00116416	I might know something. But my memory ain't what it used to be. Sometimes it needs motivating.
AID00116417	Do you know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116418	Ain't that a coincidence! My mind's still hazy on the subject.
AID00116419	I still want to know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison.
AID00116420	I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
AID00116421	Do you know if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116422	I might know something. 'Bout 100 caps worth of something, let's say?
AID00116423	Do you know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116424	What a coincidence! I'd still like my 100 caps!
AID00116425	I still want to know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison.
AID00116426	I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
AID00116427	Do you know if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116428	Military operations are classified information. The brass is familiar with the situation at the NCRCF.
AID00116429	Does the NCR have any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116430	Military operations are classified information.
AID00116431	I know the NCR is planning to attack the prison.
AID00116432	I have no idea. I just go and do what they tell me.
AID00116433	Does the NCR have any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116434	I would certainly hope that someone should handle it! Not that they tell me anything.
AID00116435	Do you know if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116436	We'd be the last to know.
AID00116437	Have you heard if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116438	I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
AID00116439	Have you heard if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116440	Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
AID00116441	Have you heard if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116442	There's a prison north of here? Well, don't go picking up any hitchhikers and you should be all right.
AID00116443	Do you know if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
AID00116444	SgtMcGeeGoodbye
AID00116445	You were the one who came talking to me.
AID00116446	I need to get going.
AID00116447	LtHayesGoodbye
AID00116448	Fine by me.

AID00116452	RNashCasserole
AID00116453	My specialty is a radscorpion venom casserole. It's a more appetizing than it sounds!
AID00116454	The venom has a sharp, smokey flavor, and it numbs your mouth so fierce you'll forget you ever had a tongue!
AID00116455	It's perfectly safe, long as you don't have sores in your mouth for the venom to find your blood. 'Cause that'll kill you dead.
AID00116456	What do you cook?
AID00116457	<Play Jason's Speech.>
AID00116458	Yes, that's everything. I'll tell Jason the rockets are ready. It's time to get this over with.
AID00116459	That's everything, right? Let the "Great Journey" begin.
AID00116460	Yes. I'll tell Jason that the Great Journey can begin.
AID00116461	The rockets are set to go, right?
AID00116462	What's the Bison Steve?
AID00116463	It's an old hotel and casino here in town. Old Laurie used to rent out rooms there, but she took off months ago.
AID00116464	Across the way from the Vikki and Vance, the other old casino. Can't miss it.
AID00116465	What's the Bison Steve?
AID00116466	HVTeacherLines
AID00116467	Now, who can tell me the primary components of gunpowder?
AID00116468	The principles of fusion are relatively simple.

AID00116470	HVRangerRadioDisturbed

AID00116472	ChrisHavTellsJasonGoodToGo
AID00116473	Hey Jason, your rockets are ready!
AID00116474	HarlandWhatFolks
AID00116475	Oh, you haven't run across Bright's little cult upstairs, eh?
AID00116476	Harmless bunch, really. Religion and me never really got along, but they're good company. I helped out with odds and ends.
AID00116477	What "folks" were you escorting to work?
AID00116478	ChrisHavLabIntercom
AID00116479	That's none of your business, smoothskin!
AID00116480	I already told you how to get up here. Big room on the east side of the first floor. Take the stairs up. Got it?
AID00116481	What's the deal with all the rockets down here?
AID00116482	That's none of your business, smoothskin!
AID00116483	Jason was very clear. Get rid of the demons, then report back. He didn't tell you to poke around down there. Got it?
AID00116484	What's the deal with all the rockets down here?
AID00116485	So you were in some gang? Were they tough?
AID00116486	Were they tough? I was in the Khans, man. It doesn't get any badder.
AID00116487	So you were in a gang? Were they tough?
AID00116488	What do you protect your town from?
AID00116489	You name it. Anything that comes within a thousand yards that looks like trouble.
AID00116490	Lately we been getting ghouls, coming from the road to REPCONN, out to the west. Quite a few, last couple days.
AID00116491	The big threat is the Legion coming from the East. If they decide to attack with a full force they'll run us over. But so far we been lucky.

AID00116502	I'll see what I can do about the safe.
AID00116503	You shouldn't have any more problems with the generator.
AID00116504	I'm making myself useful around here. Need anything done?
AID00116505	Do Rangers normally walk up and announce themselves? I don't think so.
AID00116506	Wait! I'm not a Ranger!
AID00116507	How do I make myself useful?
AID00116508	PrimmNCRSheriffConvo
AID00116509	Yes Lieutenant!
AID00116510	Are you ready to depart for Primm?
AID00116511	Yes sir!
AID00116512	Ok, we have some soldiers heading to town now. I'll have them sweep the Bison Steve before they start regular patrols.
AID00116513	I just wanted to get close to you to kill you.
AID00116514	[Attack] You won't need to worry about bills where you're going.
AID00116515	Newsflash. Fantastic is irreplaceable.
AID00116516	You pay me a stack of caps right now and I'll forget you have my job.
AID00116517	[SUCCEEDED] Aw, man. How am I supposed to buy chems now? Fine. Here.
AID00116518	[FAILED] Ha! You had me going for a second there. Then I remembered that there's only one Fantastic. I'm king of this dump.
AID00116519	How did you get this job?
AID00116520	It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
AID00116521	They asked me if I knew anything about power plants. I said as much as anyone I'd ever met.
AID00116522	They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
AID00116523	Why should the power go to the Strip and McCarran?
AID00116524	Because I get paid, that's why. Per kilowatt-hour, whatever the hell that is. That's where the NCR wants the power, so that's where I want it.
AID00116525	But you know, you do that, maybe I put in a good word for you with them. Fantastic's little helper. There's a reputation you can hang your hat on.
AID00116526	No.
AID00116527	Ah well. Guess I'll have to wait for the next curious sucker.
AID00116528	I am now.
AID00116529	Well hey, if you find yourself up at the mainframe, do yourself a favor and make sure you send the power to the right place.
AID00116530	It needs to go to the Strip and McCarran.
AID00116531	How would someone retarget the mirrors?
AID00116532	There's these two terminals outside. They control the mirrors. I tried fooling with them but didn't get very far.
AID00116533	You'd have to get them to talk to the mainframe up in the tower, then do the rest from up there. I'm guessing. But it sounds good, right?
AID00116534	Hey, you're not thinking of going up there, are you?
AID00116535	What are you trying to accomplish?
AID00116536	Well, see, we're getting power, because the guy running this place is Fantastic.
AID00116537	But the mirrors outside aren't aimed right, so we're running at one percent efficiency. And I guess that just isn't good enough for some assholes.
AID00116538	Trouble is, most of the controls for this place aren't here - they're in the tower.
AID00116539	And that place has some crazy Pre-War security system that the dumbshit NCR set off when they took over. Killed two guys. Now they won't go near it.
AID00116540	They want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what I'm saying?
AID00116541	So you have no idea what you're doing.
AID00116542	No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have.
AID00116543	Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network.
AID00116544	That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.
AID00116545	What exactly do you do?
AID00116546	Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers.  Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
AID00116547	Like one time I imagined they were a code to get into a vault full of naked women. Man, how cool would that be?
AID00116548	What job do you have here?
AID00116549	What else? I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good.
AID00116550	Why are you worried about being replaced?
AID00116551	Worried? Do I look worried to you? I've got this under control, baby. No one else can do what I do here.
AID00116552	That's right. I'm here for your job.
AID00116553	Ah, shit. Shit, man. I need this. Gotta pay the bills. And I'm addicted to a lot of different kinds of chems. I mean a lot.
AID00116554	Ah, shit, man. You're direct, you're no-nonsense. How am I supposed to compete with that? I gotta pay these chem bills.
AID00116555	Settle down. I'm not here to replace anyone.
AID00116556	Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
AID00116557	Actually I'm not here to replace you.
AID00116558	Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
AID00116559	Settle down. I'm not here to replace anyone.
AID00116560	HVBrokenItemLine

AID00116564	Tell me about Scrambler.
AID00116565	ChrisHavTalksDuringSpeech
AID00116566	What?
AID00116567	No. No, no, no!
AID00116568	How could I... Stupid! Oh god...
AID00116569	[Lie]You're in trouble - the NCR is sending a battalion to take this place back.
AID00116570	What kind of job?
AID00116571	So, do I get a real job now or what?

AID00116573	PC declines to find Primm a new sheriff
AID00116574	I know what it's like to have a busy schedule, but surely you can squeeze this in.
AID00116575	If you run across someone whose bearing and experience screams "sheriff," simply tell him or her about Primm's perdicament. That's all it takes.
AID00116576	I don't have time to help Primm.
AID00116577	PC agrees to find a new Sheriff
AID00116578	You will? That's just marvelous! I'll start thinking up questions for the interview!
AID00116579	The sheriff that was incarcerated up at NCRCF may be a good choice.
AID00116580	You also may be able to convince that NCR guy across the road to take the town under his wing, although martial law doesn't sound so fun.
AID00116581	I'll help bring law and order back to Primm.
AID00116582	PC asks about the Sheriff's qualifications
AID00116583	It should be someone brave like you, but more of a homebody. Someone who'll settle down and watch over us.
AID00116584	I heard the Powder Gangers talking about someone in the prison named Meyers who has some experience as a sheriff. He may be a good choice.
AID00116585	Also with the NCR so close by, you may be able to get them to take over the town. Not sure why they haven't helped out already.
AID00116586	What are the qualifications for a Sheriff?
AID00116587	BeagleHostage
AID00116588	Why, yes I am. It's a pleasure to meet you.
AID00116589	I'm in a bit of a predicament here. I'd be most appreciative if you'd set me free.
AID00116590	You must be Deputy Beagle.
AID00116591	Why, I am Deputy Beagle, and I am being held hostage. Can you imagine?
AID00116592	I'd be most grateful if you would set me free.
AID00116593	Who are you?
AID00116594	I must say it's been the low point of my career in law enforcement...
AID00116595	The Powder Gangers stole into town at night and murdered my sister and her husband, the sheriff, in bed, while I was sleeping in the office.
AID00116596	I watched them for a bit, waiting for the right moment to pounce and arrest the lot of them. Taking careful notes as I watched.
AID00116597	To my dismay, they found me while I waited in the shadows and brought me here.
AID00116598	How'd you end up being a hostage?
AID00116599	Not yet.
AID00116600	No need to rush on my account. I lost feeling in my hands and legs hours ago.
AID00116601	Stay put for now.
AID00116602	Well, in that case I'll just wait for you right here.
AID00116603	Stay put.
AID00116604	Player turns the deputy loose
AID00116605	Oh that's just marvelous. I think I'll be making my way outside now. The air's a little close in here.
AID00116606	I'll set you free now.
AID00116607	It doesn't matter.
AID00116608	So what are you doing sticking around here?
AID00116609	Uh, you know, just filling up water and stuff.
AID00116610	This is Powder Ganger territory, and there's a toll. Pay up.
AID00116611	It's about time one of you guys showed up - I've been waiting long enough. The NCR will probably give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
AID00116612	Huh - didn't know there were women Powder Gangers. Oh, well - the NCR will still give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
AID00116613	NCRCFMeyersDeputySpeech
AID00116614	Okay, folks. I called you out here because I've grown to trust you. Primm, the town to the south, is looking for some new law.
AID00116615	I know that you guys don't have experience with law enforcement at least not on the enforcement side.
AID00116616	However I also know that you are honorable and looking for some redemption. This is our chance for redemption.
AID00116617	Now let's head down there and bring them some law!
AID00116618	Why haven't you killed the ranger already?
AID00116619	Yes, we could kill him easily enough. But sometimes you can learn a great deal by observing people, both enemies and friends.
AID00116620	Which is why it will be very interesting to observe how you choose to deal with the situation, and decide which you are. Enemy, or friend?
AID00116621	Do we understand one another?
AID00116622	Not interested. I don't do murder-for-hire.
AID00116623	I never said the ranger had to be killed. And I wasn't giving you the option. I merely asked if you understood.
AID00116624	HVPasswordPaladinNo
AID00116625	Makes things simple for us.
AID00116626	No, I won't comply.
AID00116627	HVPasswordPaladinYes
AID00116628	Take it all off, and hand it to me. Then come inside, and through the door at the rear of the chamber. Paladin Ramos is waiting for you.
AID00116629	Okay, I'll comply.
AID00116630	HVPasswordPaladinSeductive
AID00116631	Ok then, let's talk about something else.
AID00116632	Yessir, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
AID00116633	Let's talk about something else.
AID00116634	Yes ma'am, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
AID00116635	Let's talk about something else.
AID00116636	No, the gun is missing.
AID00116637	Have you gone loco, pardner? I can see the gun with my own three photo sensors from where I'm standing right now.
AID00116638	[You hear strange sounds coming from Primm Slim. He may be trying to read a corrupted file, but it would take more science knowledge to be sure.]
AID00116639	The display case is empty. The gun's missing.
AID00116640	Quit yammering on about missing guns, pardner. Primm Slim's a busy man, ain't got time for that sort of bosh.
AID00116641	The gun is still missing.
AID00116642	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
AID00116643	Just mosey on over to the display case and you'll see it plain as day. Quite a piece, that gun. Mint condition. Never fired.
AID00116644	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
AID00116645	What happened to Vance's Gun?
AID00116646	[SUCCEEDED] <Primm Slim buzzes and whirs while he reformats.>
AID00116647	Well look at that. I happened across this data file locked away in an isolated sub-system.
AID00116648	Scan your data registry. You've been hacked.
AID00116649	[FAILED] You're plumb loco partner.
AID00116650	Maybe you've been hacked or something?
AID00116651	Tell me about the Bison Steve.
AID00116652	The Bison Steve is one of Primm's less-impressive casino hotels. I'd steer clear of that place, pardner, if I were you.
AID00116653	Rumor is the dealers over there cheat, and that rickety roller-coaster's liable to fall down any day 'cause it wasn't built to code.
AID00116654	What about the Bison Steve hotel, across the street?
AID00116655	Tell me about the Vikki and Vance
AID00116656	Where have you been, pardner? Hiding under a rock?
AID00116657	Vikki and Vance were this nation's fourth or maybe fifth most infamous celebrity outlaw couple ever, that's who they was!
AID00116658	Primm Slim here can tell you the whole story, if you can spare a minute to hear the tale.
AID00116659	Who were Vikki and Vance?
AID00116660	Tell me about Primm
AID00116661	Primm is a thriving resort community located in Clark County, Nevada, right along Interstate 15.
AID00116662	Whether you can't wait 'til Vegas to try your luck, or want to hit one last jackpot before you leave Nevada, Primm's your place!
AID00116663	The town's Primm-eer attraction is the world-famous Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum, so you came to the right place, pardner!
AID00116664	Tell me about Primm.
AID00116665	Advance VMS03.
AID00116666	What is your plan?
AID00116667	You'll have to ask Pauline about that! She's the brains of our operation. I'm the muscle.
AID00116668	What's your plan?
AID00116669	I know you have the gun, Sammy.
AID00116670	So? That's just one of our crimes! We're depraved, stone-cold degenerates, you know? You don't want to mess with us!
AID00116671	I know the two of you stole Vance's gun down in Primm.
AID00116672	That's nice. Are you going to let me in or what?
AID00116673	Try it, I dare you. Better hope you don't miss, though.
AID00116674	I don't think I'd like that very much.
AID00116675	NCRCFChavezOut
AID00116676	I'll see what I can do.
AID00116677	I convinced Pauline that you shouldn't go through with this.
AID00116678	Really? Oh, thank god! I love that woman, but I swear this time she was gonna get us killed!
AID00116679	The gun's in the safe. The combination's 05-23-34. Take it far away from here, before she changes her mind.
AID00116680	Pauline says you should give me the gun.
AID00116681	Charm Pauline into Rethinking their plan.
AID00116682	[SUCCEEDED] Really? You think so? We've only got the one gun, and there's two of us... and we've never done anything like this before...
AID00116683	We've never been on the Strip, either, so we don't know how many guards the casinos have. And I keep having these nightmares...
AID00116684	What are we thinking? We're gonna get ourselves killed!
AID00116685	Look, tell Sammy to give you the gun, all right? Just take it! I don't want it around, tempting us to do something stupid!
AID00116686	That's the greatest plan I've ever heard in my entire life.
AID00116687	[FAILED] So does your face, all right? And Sammy will add a few more if you don't shut up!
AID00116688	Your plan has critical flaws.
AID00116689	What's your plan?
AID00116690	Sammy and me got our hands on a powerful weapon not too long ago: Vance's gun. You know - Vance, of Vance and Vikki?
AID00116691	That gun's our "shot" at the big-time. We're gonna sneak it onto the Strip and rob one of the casinos. Maybe all of them!
AID00116692	We'll be known as the greatest gunslingers to ever terrorize the wastelands!
AID00116693	Sammy! Give up your plan, it'll fail!
AID00116694	May I have permission to trade with your armory?
AID00116695	Very well. It's to our benefit that you'd be well-equipped. I'll send word ahead.
AID00116696	I'd like to go into the power plant.
AID00116697	Why would I want to let you do that?
AID00116698	Why are you here, and not on the front lines? Isn't that more important?
AID00116699	I ask myself the same question all the time. But energy is hard to come by around here. Gives you more control over this area than troops ever could.
AID00116700	Hell, if we lose the dam to the Legion, this little plant may be our last stand.
AID00116701	Shouldn't there be more people than this defending a power plant?
AID00116702	There should. But we're not getting much power out of it so none of our enemies have a big interest in it either. Not like Hoover Dam, anyway.
AID00116703	We had a real fighting force here just long enough to take it from the Brotherhood of Steel. Then they got sent east to the dam like everybody else.
AID00116704	Caesar's Legion sends skirmishers every so often. Prodding for weaknesses, mostly. The reality is, if they really wanted it, we'd all be dead.
AID00116705	You're right, I don't have a reason.
AID00116706	I'm glad we sorted this out.
AID00116707	This is public property and I can do as I please here.
AID00116708	This is NCR property and we have guns. So you can only do as we please here. And it would please us if you got the hell off our lawn.
AID00116709	<Lie>I heard my brother was stationed here. I want to know he's okay.
AID00116710	[SUCCEEDED] I wish I could tell you, but we've had so many replacements lately I couldn't be sure. Go in and look around if you want.
AID00116711	Try not to make any trouble.
AID00116712	[FAILED] Sorry. No civilians inside. I can't start making exceptions now.
AID00116713	Best you can do is talk to someone at the station where your brother enlisted.
AID00116714	[Science] I notice your solar tower isn't collecting much sunlight. I can help.
AID00116715	No need. We already have an expert hard at work on it.
AID00116716	Then again... our expert is an idiot. Hell, he might as well be a saboteur. I guess you couldn't do any worse.
AID00116717	Have him fill you in on the details. He's in the back of the building. You'll know him when you see him.
AID00116718	Keeps his sunglasses on all the time, even when he's sleeping. Idiot.
AID00116719	[Attack] I'm taking over.
AID00116720	We've held off tougher enemies than you.
AID00116721	I was hungry and was hoping this was some kind of food factory.
AID00116722	I can't tell whether you're joking or radiation melted part of your brain, but either way I don't see a good reason to let you through.
AID00116723	Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
AID00116724	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
AID00116725	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
AID00116726	[NCR Rep] I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
AID00116727	[SUCCEEDED] Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
AID00116728	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
AID00116729	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
AID00116730	<lie> I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
AID00116731	[FAILED] That uniform's got an awful lot of blood on it, soldier, and you don't look injured to me. Doesn't fit you so well either.
AID00116732	You're trying to put one over on the wrong trooper.
AID00116733	I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
AID00116734	I saw this place in the distance and wanted to investigate.
AID00116735	Or you're a Legion spy trying to infiltrate our perimeter. Give me one good reason I should let you through.
AID00116736	VMS03HaggertyStayWhereYouAre
AID00116737	Stay where you are. You're not allowed in there. This is your only warning.
AID00116738	Where should I route the power?
AID00116739	Oh, the NCR has their own designs for it, no doubt. But resist the urge to send it only to the thriving communities.
AID00116740	The need for power is great everywhere. Distributing it evenly is the most rational and humane choice.
AID00116741	Why would you trust me with this?
AID00116742	I'm a man of letters. I'd be torn to pieces by the security system they have in that tower. I'd never reach the mainframe.
AID00116743	But eventually the NCR will, or if not them, Caesar's Legion. They will use this place for war.
AID00116744	Because the possibility exists you might do anything else, you're the only choice I have.
AID00116745	The NCR asked me to help increase the plant's power output.
AID00116746	Then I would say do it. As long as the power of this plant is committed to the regional grid and not to a weapon, we are safe.
AID00116747	If you are the one to restore output, then you can route the power where you choose, and they'll never be the wiser.
AID00116748	I can't get you past the security in the tower, but I can be of some help.
AID00116749	I've discovered a password for one of the mirror control terminals outside. You'll need it.
AID00116750	They're playing you for a fool. You'll die in that tower, just like their soldiers did. Why do you think they haven't taken care of this themselves?
AID00116751	The NCR doesn't know about the weapon?
AID00116752	Not yet. By some miracle they've hired an imbecile to try and decipher the systems here.
AID00116753	He's spent months working at one console trying to get the solar reflectors to track the sun.
AID00116754	What he doesn't know is that the only thing the console controls is the plant's intercom system.
AID00116755	I tried to tell him, but he insisted that the largest console had to be the most important. Still, it's only a matter of time.
AID00116756	You think ARCHIMEDES is a weapon they built here.
AID00116757	Yes. And the technology they have in this facility is like nothing I've seen. Some of it reminds me of Enclave equipment, but more advanced.
AID00116758	A weapon based upon it would be catastrophic, no matter who claimed it.
AID00116759	It's no wonder the Brotherhood wouldn't give it up.
AID00116760	I try not to get involved.
AID00116761	Ah, but there's no avoiding it. You can only outrun the choice for so long.
AID00116762	Take now, for instance. You are inside a facility with lost technology, some of it very dangerous.
AID00116763	Unless you turn and leave right now, you'll be very much involved in the lives of people you've never seen or met.
AID00116764	Peace.
AID00116765	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AID00116766	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AID00116767	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AID00116768	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AID00116769	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AID00116770	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AID00116771	War.
AID00116772	That's... an unfortunate mistake.
AID00116773	As a Follower of the Apocalypse, I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
AID00116774	That's... an unfortunate mistake.
AID00116775	I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
AID00116776	What more is there to this place than a power plant?
AID00116777	I don't entirely know. Our records on the company that built this place suggest that their dealings were not only in energy, but also in weapons.
AID00116778	And I've seen equipment here marked with symbols used by the Pre-War military. Targeting computers. Shock sensors.
AID00116779	A codeword comes up repeatedly in the papers I've looked through here. ARCHIMEDES.
AID00116780	Why are you here?
AID00116781	I was sent here when we saw that the NCR had taken it. We have no record of the facility, but its original builders were cause for concern.
AID00116782	I'm to determine the threat level of this place and do everything in my power to prevent the revival of any dangerous Pre-War technology.
AID00116783	The NCR let me stay because they are desperate for answers about this place, but I've kept them in the dark.
AID00116784	I'm a visiting scholar. Solar power technology may be important to our future and I was sent to research it.
AID00116785	Tell me more about the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00116786	Humanity lost many things after the war. Methods of agriculture, techniques for survival.
AID00116787	We took it upon ourselves to piece together this knowledge and bring it back to them.
AID00116788	I want what you want.
AID00116789	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AID00116790	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AID00116791	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AID00116792	Not really. I just kind of stumbled in.
AID00116793	That's for me to know.
AID00116794	They're looking for help getting this plant running.
AID00116795	Interesting. Forgive me for prying, but I'm curious. Are you with a particular group?
AID00116796	I just do what's necessary to keep the peace.
AID00116797	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AID00116798	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AID00116799	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AID00116800	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AID00116801	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AID00116802	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AID00116803	My only true allegiance is to myself.
AID00116804	Then for everyone's sake, I hope you serve a worthy master. Are you a maker of war, or peace?
AID00116805	I'm in the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00116806	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here.
AID00116807	I'm a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse, and for once we might want the same thing.
AID00116808	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
AID00116809	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here. For once our organizations may want the same thing.
AID00116810	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
AID00116811	I serve Caesar.
AID00116812	Then may you die in his service. I have nothing to say to you.
AID00116813	I'm with the NCR.
AID00116814	That makes sense. It is their facility, after all. At least as long as they can hold it. As for me, I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00116815	That's not your concern.
AID00116816	Interesting. Forgive me for prying, but I'm curious. Are you with a particular group?
AID00116817	This is your turf. For all I know you could have me killed for my allegiance. Who are you with?
AID00116818	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. Yes. I'm part of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00116819	If you're not familiar, we seek peace and the spread of knowledge. Knowledge that must never be lost to the world.
AID00116820	Now your turn.
AID00116821	[FAILED] I would, but I wouldn't want to influence your answer.
AID00116822	Uh... you first.
AID00116823	More of a drifter.
AID00116824	I see. Then you must have some special business here, for them to have let you through.
AID00116825	My interest in this place is scientific.
AID00116826	Then we have that in common. Whom do you typically work with?
AID00116827	I'm a soldier.
AID00116828	Well that explains it. NCR? Who do you fight for?
AID00116829	HVRamosIntercomGetRanger
AID00116830	You'll find your belongings in the chest to your right. Don't come back until you've dealt with the ranger.
AID00116831	HVRamosIntercomPostPush
AID00116832	Set up HELIOS One finale sequence, including the ARCHIMEDES laser.
AID00116833	Forget I said anything.
AID00116834	JNashHowLaw
AID00116835	You done everything you could, youngster. It's over for Primm. Ain't nothing to be done about it.
AID00116836	How can I bring rule of law back to Primm?
AID00116837	Well I guess you're gonna have to find us a new lawman.
AID00116838	I suggest talking to those NCR troopers across the bridge. I also overheard the Powder Gangsters talking about some ex-sheriff on lockdown there.
AID00116839	Your deputy died in Bison Steve.
AID00116840	Right now Beagle is the closest Primm's got to any organized law, but he's still stuck up in Bison Steve.
AID00116841	First thing I'd say his get his sorry butt outta there.
AID00116842	What can I do to help Primm?
AID00116843	Your guess is good as mine. You might luck upon someone who's a natural-born sheriff.
AID00116844	I heard of one fella what got himself locked in that NCR jailhouse up I-15. Maybe that ain't the best credential, but a sheriff's a sheriff.
AID00116845	I imagine the NCR would be able to bring some law to the town, too. But from what I seen they barely got the firepower to protect themselves.
AID00116846	How can I help bring rule of law back to Primm?
AID00116847	With the NCR driven off? I figure our only hope'd be for someone like you to find us someone who's crazy or dimwitted enough to take the job.
AID00116848	How can I bring back rule of law to Primm?
AID00116849	With Meyers dead and his deputies gone, Primm's only hope is to accept NCR rule. If you run across one of their patrols, tell 'em so.
AID00116850	How can I bring rule of law back to Primm?
AID00116851	Meyers wants to sheriff Primm, and wants you to leave the town alone.
AID00116852	JNashAboutVikkiVance
AID00116853	That's where we are. This here little casino brought some cash and bodies into the town before them Powder Gangsters came in.
AID00116854	They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in kind of a box canyon. Guess this is as fitting a place for that as any.
AID00116855	I reckon if they thought hard enough about it, they'd realize they got more bodies than we have bullets, but for now we're safe enough in here.
AID00116856	What's at Vikki and Vance?
AID00116857	JNashWhoAreYou
AID00116858	Johnson Nash's my name. Husband to Ruby Nash. Lived in Primm going on eight years now, thick and thin.
AID00116859	I'm a trader primarily, for what it's worth with things like they are. I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.
AID00116860	Who are you?
AID00116861	Meyers wants to be sheriff.
AID00116862	
AID00116863	[SUCCEEDED] So you weighed the value of confirming if his location was known against your advantage of surprise. All right.
AID00116864	It was a calculated risk. Asking questions would have tipped him off.
AID00116865	[FAILED] What's in doubt isn't your ability to kill. It's your ability to be thorough. Your circumspection, so to speak.
AID00116866	So again, I ask: How do you know that killing this ranger didn't make matters worse, exposing us to greater dangers?
AID00116867	I'm pretty sure I made things better. I mean, I killed him.

AID00116874	I don't have 100 caps on me.
AID00116875	Well, I swore not to say a word, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
AID00116876	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
AID00116877	Here's your 100 caps.
AID00116878	I'm here looking for work.
AID00116879	Never mind, then.

AID00116883	I sent power to McCarran and the Strip.
AID00116884	Whoa, really? Ho, shit! I knew I could do it. Those NCR pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of fucking Fantastic!
AID00116885	But don't worry, I'll tell them what you did for me, man. Not all of it, though. They'd think I was an idiot. But some of it.
AID00116886	Keep at it, man. One day you could end up where I am. You never know.
AID00116887	I overloaded the plant. No one will be able to use it to power a weapon.
AID00116888	So I saw. Shame to let the energy go to waste, but on the other hand, now we can rest easy. Here, accept these, for your efforts.
AID00116889	I diverted power to the grid.
AID00116890	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to everyone. Very admirable.
AID00116891	Now that the NCR has more or less what they want, hopefully their curiosity about the plant is satisfied and they'll dig no deeper.
AID00116892	The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
AID00116893	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to Freeside, where power is in short supply. A respectable decision.
AID00116894	Now that the NCR has more or less what they want, hopefully their curiosity about the plant is satisfied and they'll dig no deeper.
AID00116895	The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
AID00116896	I saw that on the monitors here. It's strange, but I can't find where on the grid the power is being sent to.
AID00116897	Nevertheless, hopefully the NCR's curiosity is satisfied now that the plant's output is improved. Here, accept these, for your efforts.

AID00116932	Some Powder Gangers did you wrong, is that it? Get in line.
AID00116933	Still, you do look capable enough, and manpower hasn't been easy to come by...
AID00116934	All right. Fine by me if you want to put yourself in harm's way. I'll mark the staging area on your map. Talk to Sergeant Lee.
AID00116935	Classified or not, I want to help make the attack.
AID00116936	Do all of the brothers use this equipment?
AID00116937	Everyone in the base has to spend a minimum of five hours a week running tactical simulations, but outside that, interest is scarce.
AID00116938	It wasn't always this way. When we first moved into the bunker, everyone was so excited that the VR systems were intact.
AID00116939	Over time, though, my fellows have become listless and less entertained by the wonders of the technology around us.
AID00116940	That's why Apprentice Watkins is such a joy to work with. Her unbridled enthusiasm for virtual combat is unparalleled.
AID00116941	And you are?
AID00116942	Ah, the outsider. I suppose it's too much to ask that jarhead Ramos to keep outsiders away from my research.
AID00116943	I am Head Scribe Taggart, and I am much too busy to deal with the likes of you right now.

AID00116990	I imagine the NCR doesn't deal with deserters kindly.
AID00116991	Yeah, if we see the NCR, they'll be waiting for us with a bullet to the brain pan.
AID00116992	So what are we supposed to do, just run?
AID00116993	<Attack> Murdering deserters. Well, I think I've heard enough.
AID00116994	And it'll be the last thing you hear!

AID00117102	You! Now you've gone and done it! No one messes with my radio station!
AID00117103	Tell me about RobCo.
AID00117104	RobCo industries purchased REPCONN in 2075 to assist with some of RobCo's military projects, as well as developing unmanned space exploration.
AID00117105	The relationship between RobCo and REPCONN is mutually beneficial, and we hope that both companies bolster each other well into the next century.
AID00117106	Research and development.
AID00117107	As you may already know, REPCONN is an industry leader in producing alternative fuels for military and scientific purposes.
AID00117108	REPCONN scientists were pioneers in fission-based propulsion systems, and have recently had some very exciting breakthroughs with plasma systems.
AID00117109	The recent partnership with RobCo has freed our engineers from mundane business matters, allowing them to focus solely on future projects.
AID00117110	REPCONN's history.
AID00117111	REPCONN's illustrious history began way back in 2054, shortly after the famous Delta XI rocket was completed and launched.
AID00117112	REPCONN's initial focus was on the development of fuel to be used in orbital propulsion in response to the energy crisis of 2052. Sad times, indeed.
AID00117113	The company really took off when RobCo purchased REPCONN in late 2076 to develop unmanned rockets to explore the solar system.
AID00117114	What can you tell me about REPCONN?
AID00117115	I can answer whatever questions you'd like... provided your query is limited to REPCONN history, research and development, or RobCo.
AID00117116	I'd like a tour of the museum.
AID00117117	Excellent, excellent! Please be patient, the tour will begin in just a moment.
AID00117118	I am so pleased you enjoyed the last tour! A new tour will begin in a moment, if you wish to wait.
AID00117119	I'd like another tour.
AID00117120	Goodbye.
AID00117121	That's enough about REPCONN.
AID00117122	Very well, feel free to ask me more about REPCONN at any time, don't be shy.
AID00117123	The tour showcases REPCONN's amazing scientific contributions, and the promise of many more, coupled with its parent company, RobCo.
AID00117124	REPCONHQTourStation
AID00117125	Behind me is our most recent rocket project, which we're keeping under our hats... until "launch," if you'll pardon the expression.
AID00117126	And in front of me is a model  - not actual size - of the launch dome we are using to send our rockets screeeeaming into orbit.
AID00117127	REPCONHQTourStation3
AID00117128	To my right you can see a sample of some old "safety barrels" REPCONN once used to store radioactive waste. Perfectly safe.
AID00117129	On my left is an example of a mountain of REPCONN safety barrels some legislators claim are poisoning our environment. Ridiculous.
AID00117130	REPCONHQTourStation02
AID00117131	Look here - a row of multi-colored plasma fuels! Careful, they may look safe to drink, but your stomach is the last place they should be.
AID00117132	Why the difference in cylinder size? Refining our production methods has resulted in higher yields of fuel over time, that's why!
AID00117133	REPCONHQTourStation01
AID00117134	In the lead-lined case behind me is a spent radioactive rod from of our old reactors. No need to stand too close, let's move along, shall we?

AID00117151	VVault11Slideshow2
AID00117152	Currently, you may be feeling sad or angry. Perhaps you never got to have grandkids, or to enjoy the pleasures of a fresh cigar.
AID00117153	VVault11Slideshow3
AID00117154	But march with your chin held high, soldier, and remember that each of us has an important role to play.
AID00117155	VVault11Slideshow4
AID00117156	For some people, their role might be to heal the sick. For others, it might mean they will drive a racecar or fly a rocket ship.
AID00117157	VVault11Slideshow5
AID00117158	And some of us are meant to forfeit our lives for the good of the people.
AID00117159	VVault11Slideshow6
AID00117160	Sure it might not be as fun as driving a racecar, but it's every bit as important.
AID00117161	VVault11Slideshow7
AID00117162	Let's take a moment to reflect on the moments that made your life worth living.
AID00117163	VVault11Slideshow8
AID00117164	Think about that time you kissed your steady girl for the first time under the bleachers at the big game.
AID00117165	VVault11Slideshow9
AID00117166	Or when you snuck out after curfew to catch that new flick that your parents wouldn't let you see because it was too scary. Boy, were they right!

AID00117168	And who could forget when you met the love of your life? What a looker! These are just examples.
AID00117169	VVault11Slideshow11
AID00117170	Do you feel that feeling stirring in your chest as you think of these things? Good. What you are feeling is peace.
AID00117171	VVault11Slideshow12
AID00117172	You've led a great life. Living it has been its own reward. But it is only the beginning.
AID00117173	VVault11Slideshow13
AID00117174	Close your eyes now, and imagine what joys await you in the next life - the afterlife. Can you see them? Good.
AID00117175	188ClayMedicineBuy
AID00117176	Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
AID00117177	I might be interested in buying your "headache medicine." How much?
AID00117178	188ClayThoughtsSmallPicture
AID00117179	I need to take off my medicine...
AID00117180	Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
AID00117181	With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say.
AID00117182	Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship.
AID00117183	Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
AID00117184	Do your thinking about "Here."
AID00117185	188ClayThoughtsBigPicture
AID00117186	Let me take off my medicine...
AID00117187	Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets.
AID00117188	All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know.
AID00117189	Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
AID00117190	Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
AID00117191	Do your thinking about "Everywhere."
AID00117192	188ClayThoughtsPlayer
AID00117193	Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
AID00117194	Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
AID00117195	You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? But how?
AID00117196	Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
AID00117197	A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. Sorry if I said anything weird.
AID00117198	Do your thinking about me.
AID00117199	188ClayPayForThoughts
AID00117200	Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
AID00117201	I'll pay 100 caps to hear your thoughts.
AID00117202	Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
AID00117203	Here's another 100 caps. I want to hear your thoughts again.
AID00117204	That's all right, mister. You will someday.
AID00117205	Sounds interesting... I don't have 100 caps, though.
AID00117206	That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
AID00117207	Sounds interesting... I don't have 100 caps, though.
AID00117208	Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
AID00117209	Any more thoughts I can pay you for?
AID00117210	Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
AID00117211	Any more thoughts I can pay you for?
AID00117212	188ClayJunk
AID00117213	That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
AID00117214	I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
AID00117215	You don't sell that junk behind you?
AID00117216	188ClayParents
AID00117217	I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
AID00117218	Where are your parents, kid? Are you here all alone?
AID00117219	188ClayMedicineWhatIsIt
AID00117220	This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. Really think, I mean.
AID00117221	What is your "medicine" and how do you take it off?
AID00117222	188ClaySellThoughts
AID00117223	I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, because I never hear it.
AID00117224	Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
AID00117225	I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
AID00117226	You sell *thoughts?*
AID00117227	188ClayBuySell
AID00117228	Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
AID00117229	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00117230	Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
AID00117231	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00117232	Got nothing to spare.
AID00117233	Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
AID00117234	Can't help you.
AID00117235	I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
AID00117236	Can't help you.
AID00117237	But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
AID00117238	Can't help you.
AID00117239	Sure. Here's 25 caps.
AID00117240	Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
AID00117241	Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
AID00117242	You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.

AID00117245	188AlexanderPcAchievements
AID00117246	Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
AID00117247	I made sure those prisoners won't bother Primm anymore.
AID00117248	That'll help. Still plenty of problems out that way, though.
AID00117249	I restored rule of law to Primm.
AID00117250	You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
AID00117251	Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
AID00117252	That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
AID00117253	Still, it'll take some time for routes to readjust. I expect I'll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
AID00117254	I've cleared all the trouble west of here. Caravans can start using I-15 again.
AID00117255	188AlexanderNoEnergyWeapons
AID00117256	We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
AID00117257	We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
AID00117258	Why don't you deal in energy weapons?
AID00117259	Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
AID00117260	One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesn't do much good.
AID00117261	And that's how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we don't bring in is energy weapons.
AID00117262	Tell me about Gun Runner caravans.
AID00117263	188AlexanderAboutYourRole
AID00117264	I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
AID00117265	Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
AID00117266	Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
AID00117267	What do you do?
AID00117268	188AlexanderBuySell
AID00117269	There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
AID00117270	So where can I buy some weapons?
AID00117271	188AlexanderAboutGunRunners
AID00117272	The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
AID00117273	We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
AID00117274	Tell me about the Gun Runners.
AID00117275	188AlexanderGunRunner
AID00117276	Like you have a clue what that even means.
AID00117277	So you're a Gun Runner?
AID00117278	188AlexanderSeeInventory
AID00117279	[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
AID00117280	Take a look.
AID00117281	I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear.
AID00117282	[FAILED] Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
AID00117283	Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
AID00117284	Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
AID00117285	A gun nut like you must have some weapons stashed around here.
AID00117286	Take a look.
AID00117287	Let me see what you have for sale.
AID00117288	188AlexanderAreYouSelling
AID00117289	Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
AID00117290	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00117291	188AlexanderThreaten
AID00117292	You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
AID00117293	I don't like your attitude.
AID00117294	188MichelleBoastSavePrimm
AID00117295	That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
AID00117296	Primm's safe now. I took care of those prisoners.
AID00117297	What do you know about Legion raids?
AID00117298	Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
AID00117299	Why's this place called the 188?
AID00117300	You do know these old roads were numbered, right? We're standing where the 95 and 93 meet. And 95 plus 93 equals... 188.
AID00117301	Why'd you settle in this dump?
AID00117302	There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
AID00117303	No shortage of customers... so long as Legion raids south of here don't get worse, anyways.
AID00117304	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00117305	Have a look.
AID00117306	Who are you?
AID00117307	Name's Michelle. My Dad and me run this store. His name's Samuel. I take the day shift and he takes nights.
AID00117308	We came here about a month ago, when Primm went to hell on account of the prison break north of there. Found a bin to call home and set up shop.
AID00117309	188SamuelBuySell
AID00117310	You bet.
AID00117311	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00117312	188SamuelBoastSavePrimm
AID00117313	Guess that makes you a big hero - in Primm. Like I said, me and Michelle didn't sit around waiting to be saved. Business is better here, anyway.
AID00117314	I took care of those prisoners myself. Primm is clear now.
AID00117315	188SamuelAbout188Safety
AID00117316	Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
AID00117317	Is it safe here?
AID00117318	188SamuelAboutPrimm
AID00117319	Michelle and I ran a little shop in Primm 'till a prison break north of town spoiled it for everyone. Goddamned convicts just about shut down I-15.
AID00117320	When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
AID00117321	Why'd you leave Primm?
AID00117322	188SamuelAboutBusiness
AID00117323	When 15 shut down, 95 became the route NCR citizens use to get to the Strip - or limp back home, after the Strip's drained 'em of caps.
AID00117324	We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
AID00117325	...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
AID00117326	Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
AID00117327	Why's business so good here?
AID00117328	188SamAboutSam
AID00117329	Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
AID00117330	We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
AID00117331	Who are you?
AID00117332	188ClayThoughtsChangeMind
AID00117333	I thought you'd say that.
AID00117334	On second thought... maybe another time.
AID00117335	VVault11AudioLogSolutionResponse
AID00117336	Congratulations, citizens of Vault 11! You have made the decision not to sacrifice one of your own.
AID00117337	You can walk with your head held high knowing that your commitment to human life is a shining example to us all.
AID00117338	And to make that feeling of pride even sweeter, I have some exciting news.
AID00117339	Despite what you were led to believe, the population of Vault 11 is not going to be exterminated for its disobedience.
AID00117340	Instead, the mechanism to open the main vault door has now been enabled, and you can come and go at your leisure.
AID00117341	But not so fast! Be sure to check with your overseer to find out if it's safe to leave. Here at Vault-Tec, your safety is our number one priority.
AID00117342	VVault11AudioLogVault11Solution
AID00117343	All right, I know you can hear me, so listen up. There's five of us left. Five. Out of... I don't know how many.
AID00117344	So... it's over. We've talked and it's over. We're not going to send anybody to die anymore.
AID00117345	So shut off our water or gas us or do whatever it is you're programmed to do. But we're done listening to you.
AID00117346	Okay. Here.
AID00117347	Thanks.  We're leaving now, we don't want no more trouble.
AID00117348	Hey, just checking the place out. Now I'll just be on my way...
AID00117349	We don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. You're gonna need to pay a fine if you want to leave in one piece. 100 caps should cover it.
AID00117350	VickyVanceRaiders
AID00117351	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00117352	Of course.
AID00117353	Goodbye.
AID00117354	Until next time.
AID00117355	You're welcome to try.
AID00117356	There is always a choice.
AID00117357	It looks like these people got more than just hurt.
AID00117358	By extorting money from the locals?  What happened here?
AID00117359	No raider would be foolish enough to go parading around in that.
AID00117360	<Pay 50 caps> Okay, here.
AID00117361	Thanks, Let's get out of here boys.
AID00117362	But I don't even have that much.
AID00117363	That's alright, we'll take what we can from your body before the law shows up.
AID00117364	I don't have that many caps.
AID00117365	Alright, since you look new and didn't know better, we'll cut you some slack.  50 caps.

AID00117457	Voice 2: Hell of a way to test it.
AID00117458	BMNeilGoodbye
AID00117459	Tell me about the Nightkin.
AID00117460	The Nightkin are vicious in combat, and that's if you see them coming. Most don't.
AID00117461	They were created to be soldiers, and given devices to camouflage them in battle. Unfortunately, the devices drove most of them mad over time.
AID00117462	They spend most of their time at the top of the mountain, but patrol the roads after dark as well. You'd do well to avoid the mountain at night.
AID00117463	
AID00117464	[SUCCEEDED] Help would improve the odds. Help might just make the difference...
AID00117465	All right, if you're good enough at what you do to meet me in the village up near the peak, we can talk further.
AID00117466	I'll have a plan by the time I see you - if I see you. Good luck. It's going to be a lot harder for you to get up there than it will be for me.
AID00117467	Sounds like you've had enough of Tabitha. What if you had some help?
AID00117468	[FAILED] Hmm. While your enthusiasm is... admirable, I think I'd best stay here so I can warn other travelers.
AID00117469	Hey! Let's you and me - you know, us! - let's overthrow Tabitha together!
AID00117470	What is Jacobstown?
AID00117471	The opposite of Black Mountain! A stable community of Mutants, mostly, led by a mentally stable leader.
AID00117472	Humans are welcome there, so long as they behave themselves. Look northwest of Red Rock Canyon if you want to find it.
AID00117473	How did Tabitha end up in control?
AID00117474	For years, Black Mountain was a peaceful community. Its leader, Marcus, broadcast an invitation to Mutants throughout the wasteland.
AID00117475	That's how I found Black Mountain. So did others, most of them second generation Mutants. Marcus welcomed everyone - that was his mistake.
AID00117476	The community ended up being mostly second gen - not very bright, but easy to influence. Fine, until the Nightkin came along, led by Tabitha...
AID00117477	In a week she had most of the second-gens thinking she was some kind of prophet - and that she should be broadcasting her "truth," not Marcus.
AID00117478	Marcus saw what was coming and decided to leave before things got out of hand. He smashed the radio and left to found Jacobstown.
AID00117479	Why are you here, instead of Jacobstown?
AID00117480	Marcus sent me here a couple of months ago to check on Black Mountain. I suppose you could say I came here as a spy.
AID00117481	But with no signs of Tabitha's weakening, and none of the second-gens ready to revolt or to come to Jacobstown, there wasn't much I could do.
AID00117482	Down here, on the other hand, I've saved a dozen Mutants from heading up the mountain. It's not much, but it's something.
AID00117483	I have my own reasons to stay away from Jacobstown for a while - reasons we won't be discussing - so I've stayed here.
AID00117484	BMNeilAskDetails
AID00117485	The road is a series of switchbacks up to the peak. There are three blockades, plus patrols. Sneaking past them would be... difficult.
AID00117486	Just before the peak is a kind of shanty village. More second-gens there. And then there's Tabitha's compound - heavily guarded by her Nightkin.
AID00117487	What sort of trouble should I expect if I head up?
AID00117488	The road is a series of switchbacks up to the peak. There are three blockades, plus patrols. Sneaking past them would be... difficult.
AID00117489	Just before the peak is a kind of shanty village. More second-gens there. And then there's Tabitha's compound - heavily guarded by her Nightkin.
AID00117490	Remind me what I should expect if I head up?
AID00117491	You say that super mutants were *made*?
AID00117492	Yes... And it's not something I care to discuss with one of your kind.
AID00117493	If you have some insatiable curiosity about the matter, talk to Marcus in Jacobstown. He's more patient with such questions than I am.
AID00117494	Why are some Super Mutants smarter than others?
AID00117495	Not all Super Mutants were created equal. Or at the same time, or for the same purpose.
AID00117496	The first generation tends to be smarter, stronger, and... more civilized, I suppose you could say, than the ones made later, save the Nightkin.
AID00117497	Spare me the "poor mutants" rap, all right?
AID00117498	Of course. Sorry I bothered you. Enjoy your travels.
AID00117499	Moving on...
AID00117500	Yes, that's exactly what I'm telling you to do. Move on.
AID00117501	Sorry about that. No offense intended.
AID00117502	And none taken... since you apologized.
AID00117503	You seem friendly, for a mutant.
AID00117504	Keep saying things like that, and I won't be so friendly. Not every Super Mutant is a brain-damaged brute.
AID00117505	Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans - and the rest don't really have any choice in the matter, do they?
AID00117506	They had it coming if they drew on you.
AID00117507	So thats it?  You've resorted to raiding and crime?
AID00117508	Perhaps I could convince them to take you back.
AID00117509	I'll see what I can do.
AID00117510	I'll see what I can do.
AID00117511	You're right.  You guys are totally screwed.
AID00117512	Well you made the right one.
AID00117513	RadioBMSegment01
AID00117514	[Rhonda] You're listening to Radio Free Utobitha, bringing truth to Utobithians 24 hours a day! Welcome!
AID00117515	[Tabitha] I am in control here!
AID00117516	[Rhonda] That was today's and every day's extra special guest, Best Friend Tabitha, supreme commander of Utobitha and Wearer of the True Eyes!
AID00117517	[Tabitha] I still miss you, Rhonda. After all these years...
AID00117518	[Rhonda] Also joining us from his locked cell is Raul Tejada, master mechanic who can be executed at any time! Hello, Raul. Or should that be "Hola?"
AID00117519	[Raul] Uh, either one works.
AID00117520	[Tabitha] Today you die, Raul! I command it!
AID00117521	[Rhonda] Ooooh, Raul. Supreme commander Tabitha says you die today. Any reaction?
AID00117522	[Raul] I going to obey supreme Tabitha, claro, whatever she say. Just I feel so bad I die before I fix her special robot.
AID00117523	[Silence.]
AID00117524	[Tabitha] <Growls in frustration.>
AID00117525	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this musical interlude! Enjoy!
AID00117526	REPCONHQClosing2
AID00117527	The REPCONN museum is now closed. Visitors are required to leave the premises.
AID00117528	REPCONHQClosing
AID00117529	Hello, please remember closing time is at 5 PM. Please make your way toward an exit.
AID00117530	REPCONHQTour07
AID00117531	This is the final stop on our tour. This model of our solar system is a small example of where the partnership between RobCo and REPCONN hopes to go.
AID00117532	See those little rockets zipping about? They are manned by robots, tirelessly looking for resources to mine on planets beyond our own.
AID00117533	And that's it for our tour today, Rocketeers - RobCo and its tiny partner REPCONN thank you! Any further questions, please, feel free to ask.
AID00117534	REPCONHQTour06
AID00117535	Now for the highlight of our tour! Due to a generous donation from RobCo, this next exhibit showcases the wondrous world of - robots!
AID00117536	Around you are the incredible Eyebot, the fearsome Sentry Bot, and the always-helpful Mr. Handy. That helpfulness runs through our whole line!
AID00117537	REPCONHQTour5
AID00117538	Now these colorful fellows behind me are REPCONN's earliest... experiments in flight. Feel free to read the plaques and learn, Rocketeers!
AID00117539	RadioBMSegment05
AID00117540	 Welcome back, Utobitha. I have with me Best Friend Tabitha, who has something important she'd like to share.
AID00117541	 Well Rhonda, I'm a little concerned about the number of humans that keep coming to Black Mountain.
AID00117542	 Humans? Here? Why do you think they'd do that?
AID00117543	 Honestly, I think they're a little jealous of the ideal society we've built here, Rhonda. And I can't blame them.
AID00117544	 We have everything we need here. Food, shelter, safety, entertainment. It really is a paradise.
AID00117545	 There's no arguing with the truth, is there?
AID00117546	 But humans need to be aware that Black Mountain is no place for them. In fact, it's even dangerous for them here.
AID00117547	 Why is that?
AID00117548	 First of all, there's the radiation. That warm, peaceful glow that we all know and love doesn't have the same effect on humans.
AID00117549	 You see, humans are weak, and have an inherent defect that causes them to fall apart when exposed to radiation.
AID00117550	 That sounds terrible! How do they stand it? Radiation's, like, everywhere!
AID00117551	 I know. They truly have a hard lot in life. Which may explain why they're so irritable all the time.
AID00117552	 I don't know about you, Utobitha, but my eyes have really been opened. We'll be back after some music!
AID00117553	RadioBMSegment04
AID00117554	[Rhonda] Welcome back, Utobitha. It's time!
AID00117555	[Tabitha] Time for what, Rhonda?
AID00117556	[Rhonda] <sing-song> True Eye Seeing Time!
AID00117557	[Applause track.]
AID00117558	[Rhonda] I see that you're already wearing the True Eyes, Best Friend Tabitha, along with your head of True Hair. What do you see?
AID00117559	[Tabitha] Uh... I see Neil...
AID00117560	[Rhonda] First-generation Neil from down the mountain? And what is he up to?
AID00117561	[Tabitha] Standing outside his shack down there.
AID00117562	[Rhonda] In the same spot as before, or has he moved?
AID00117563	[Tabitha] A little.
AID00117564	[Rhonda] Wow! It must be so exciting to see and know all. What a powerful reminder of your ultimate authority and power for our listeners!
AID00117565	[Tabitha] I see Moe...
AID00117566	[Rhonda] Moe, the Centaur? Favorite Centaur Moe? What's he up to?
AID00117567	[Tabitha] Licking the gate. Wants out of the pen.
AID00117568	[Rhonda] Now, I'm almost afraid to ask, but do you see any - you know - threats out there?
AID00117569	[Tabitha] Threats all around us... converging... like a noose, tightening! Two-head-bear people astride battle cattles!
AID00117570	[Rhonda] <unnerved> Not the the dreaded battle cattle training to hunt mutants?
AID00117571	[Rhonda] <calmer> Would it be going too far to say that your gift of True Eyesight is the only thing saving our community from annihilation?
AID00117572	[Rhonda] Because I think it's so important for everyone - even the dumb-dumbs - how impossible it is to sneak up on us! More after this!
AID00117573	RadioBMSegment03
AID00117574	[Tabitha] Are you tired of getting chased because you're bigger than humans, and scaring them?
AID00117575	[Tabitha] Did you kill some and they overreacted? Are two-head-bear people shooting at you, and battle cattle mooing? Beware the battle cattle...
AID00117576	[Rhonda]<whispering a line prompt> "Leave the fear behind."
AID00117577	[Tabitha] Leave the Fear Behind. Meet at the Mountain Top! Enjoy life in a state of Utobitha - Free, Safe, Secure!
AID00117578	[Rhonda] <rushing sotto voce like disclaimers at the end of prescription ads> Freedom limited to following the commands of Best Friend Tabitha...
AID00117579	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Safety not guaranteed against siege or assault by two-head-bear people or battle cattles.
AID00117580	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Many infractions are punishable by death, no allowances for dumb-dumb "misunderstandings".
AID00117581	[Tabitha] Utobitha! Come feel the difference!
AID00117582	RadioBMSegment02
AID00117583	[Rhonda] You're listening to UNC - the Utobithian News Channel - with breaking news!
AID00117584	[Rhonda] The execution of master mechanic Raul Tajeda has again been commuted for a period of 24 hours to allow time for important repairs.
AID00117585	[Tabitha] <snarling> This time you will get it done, Raul!
AID00117586	[Rhonda] Joining us from his cell to comment on the situation is Raul Tejada. Raul?
AID00117587	[Raul] Hi, Tab - <catches himself> Rhonda.
AID00117588	[Rhonda] What's your take on the situation?
AID00117589	[Raul] All I want is to make that special robot work again, you know? I give it my best.
AID00117590	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor during which Raul will contemplate how lucky he is to be alive.
AID00117591	Not yet. Wait here.
AID00117592	Whatever you need to do, be quick about it.
AID00117593	You say Marcus smashed the radio. Not very well, apparently?
AID00117594	Heh. There's a sad story behind that. Marcus smashed it just fine, but while we were gone some Ghoul named Raul came along.
AID00117595	Tabitha turned him into her personal mechanic. A slave, really. See, if I'd been standing down here, I could've warned him before it was too late.
AID00117596	That's your plan? I *am* an intruder in the village!
AID00117597	Yes, so try to stay out of sight, because they'll be coming this way.
AID00117598	Okay, I can make that work.
AID00117599	Good luck. We're going to need it.
AID00117600	How did you end up selling weapons?
AID00117601	Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
AID00117602	And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
AID00117603	Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
AID00117604	What was your rank?
AID00117605	Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back.
AID00117606	That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
AID00117607	Administrative discharge? What does that mean?
AID00117608	It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
AID00117609	Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
AID00117610	I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
AID00117611	Just show me what you have for sale.
AID00117612	You do a lot of business with prospectors?
AID00117613	Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
AID00117614	Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
AID00117615	Something like that. Are you an NCR soldier?
AID00117616	Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
AID00117617	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
AID00117618	Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
AID00117619	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.

AID00117628	So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
AID00117629	Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
AID00117630	NCR doesn't have the caps to outfit their troops?
AID00117631	Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
AID00117632	This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty.
AID00117633	We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
AID00117634	188SamuelRepair
AID00117635	Let me see what I can do.

AID00117644	What will you do now?
AID00117645	I still have a job to do here. Some Mutants may have heard Tabitha's broadcasts and are headed here even as we speak.
AID00117646	I'll remain and direct any who show up toward Jacobstown, where they'll be much better off.
AID00117647	Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff.
AID00117648	[SUCCEEDED] Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
AID00117649	<Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff.>
AID00117650	[FAILED] Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
AID00117651	<Try to reprogram Primm Slim to act as Sheriff of Primm.>
AID00117652	188ClayThoughtsHow
AID00117653	So you convinced those NCR sons of bitches to take an interest, did you? Well, we need the help. I'll sign.
AID00117654	Will you sign this formal letter asking the NCR to take control of Primm?
AID00117655	Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
AID00117656	How do you know these things?
AID00117657	Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
AID00117658	How do you know these things?
AID00117659	Punk?  Thats my line.
AID00117660	Heh, you've got moxy, buddy, but we don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. 100 caps should cover this trip into our territory.
AID00117661	Are you deserters?
AID00117662	I like to think that we are Prisoners Of War that managed to escape before capture.
AID00117663	I don't know how long it'll be before the Legion crosses the river, but sure as fuck I don't want to be wearing a NCR inform when they get here.
AID00117664	I guess I can understand that.
AID00117665	We figured we'd make some money in New Vegas and then beat feet.
AID00117666	Then we'd head north or something and take our caps to start up a ranch or something.
AID00117667	<Attack> Well then. It sounds like there might be a bounty on your heads.
AID00117668	Perhaps, but you won't be the one to collect!
AID00117669	So that's it? You've resorted to robbing and raiding to solve your problems?
AID00117670	Our luck has gone south since we lost all of our money gambling in Vegas. We didn't go AWOL from duty to become raiders.
AID00117671	But we've seen what the Legion does to people that survive their battles. We wanted to be gone before the fighting starts.
AID00117672	And we heard there may be some safety up in New Canaan.
AID00117673	<Attack> Well, I think your luck just ran out.
AID00117674	Looks like we've got a wannabe hero on our hands, boys.
AID00117675	Why not just turn yourselves in?
AID00117676	No fucking way. We're deserters now, the NCR isn't going to throw us a ticker-tape parade for going home.
AID00117677	You're right.  You're totally screwed.
AID00117678	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over 100 caps, or we start using you for target practice.
AID00117679	<Speech>
AID00117680	[SUCCEEDED] Fuck, we lose again.
AID00117681	We heard Primm was ripe for the picking, so figured we could come here and shakedown some of the suckers. We weren't expecting a sheriff here.
AID00117682	We're just trying to put as many miles from NCR as we can, we don't want to be anywhere near New Vegas when the Legion crosses the river.
AID00117683	Your turf? I guess the news hasn't reached you yet, Primm has law again.
AID00117684	[FAILED] I seriously doubt that. You've got about as much personality as a baked potato.
AID00117685	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over the caps, or we start using you for target practice.
AID00117686	I can help if you'll let me!
AID00117687	<Attack> Well, in that case, maybe I'll do the town a favor and take you down.
AID00117688	So be it. Perhaps your corpse will be better at coughing up the caps...
AID00117689	That's some impressive weaponry. Where did it all come from?
AID00117690	All Gun Runner merchandise is constructed on-site.
AID00117691	How did you get inside there?
AID00117692	This kiosk was specially constructed around me to deter theft and assault.
AID00117693	What is this place?
AID00117694	This is the New Vegas branch of the Gun Runners, supplying the wasteland with only the finest armaments since 2155.
AID00117695	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00117696	I am ready to process our transaction.
AID00117697	I'm here to provide support. Is there anything I might be able to help with?
AID00117698	Hmm... you don't cook by any chance, do you? Farber's doing his best, but it's hard to manage an army with half my staff in line for the latrine.
AID00117699	Honestly, we're fighting a lot of fires right now. The Fiends keep pressing their position from Vault 3.
AID00117700	We've got the Legion breathing down our necks across the river. We actually took an officer alive last week, but so far he hasn't spoken a word.
AID00117701	I'm up for hire if you need some extra manpower around the base.
AID00117702	There are a lot of things I can't spare troops for right now.  If you can help us, we can definitely pay you for your work.
AID00117703	How are things going for the NCR around here?
AID00117704	Could be better, I'll say that much.
AID00117705	We set up here with our sights set on annexing New Vegas. That's a lot of resources that could do a lot of good for us. But that hasn't happened.
AID00117706	If anything, they annexed us. They rake in the profits from our soldiers and we're stuck protecting them from the Legion. Not exactly the plan.
AID00117707	Goodbye.
AID00117708	Come back and see us again soon.
AID00117709	Let's talk about something else.
AID00117710	Sure. I'm all ears.
AID00117711	I could look into who's leaking NCR intelligence.
AID00117712	You? I think you've done enough.
AID00117713	Hmm... Well, why not? Given your recent arrival, at least I can safely rule you out as the leak.
AID00117714	I'd like to have absolute trust in my men, but that's just not practical right now. Go ahead and look into it. See what you find.
AID00117715	I bet I could make the Legion prisoner talk.
AID00117716	I have Lieutenant Boyd on that already, and she's excellent. But I think she's hit a wall.
AID00117717	Talk to her, if you like. See if she has any use for you.
AID00117718	Her office is right above mine, but I think she might be interrogating right now. So she'd be upstairs on the other side of the building.
AID00117719	The Fiends?
AID00117720	As in chem fiends. Biggest gang of raiders I've ever seen. Nothing like addiction to swell your numbers. Psychotic, and completely unpredictable.
AID00117721	They've set up shop in Vault 3 to the west. Every day they attack our positions and my men repel them.
AID00117722	But every day there's more of them and less of us. I sent one of my rangers after their leader to try and destabilize them. He didn't return.
AID00117723	Hell of a thing, losing a ranger. You come to depend on them. And they come through for you so often, you forget it can happen.
AID00117724	Goodbye.
AID00117725	Wrong turn? Happens all the time. Do they give me a secretary? Of course not.
AID00117726	No, this is the first I've heard about Vault 22.
AID00117727	No, they wouldn't have briefed you, would they? Probably better that our junior fellows stay within the bounds of their pay grade, anyway.
AID00117728	<Lie> Yes, that's right.
AID00117729	Wonderful! Straight to it, then. Have you signed the release forms? No? Doesn't matter - we'll keep that to ourselves.
AID00117730	Vault 22... where to begin...
AID00117731	You seem calm given that things are as bad as they are.
AID00117732	Calm is what you have to be when people look to you. And it's all you can be when things are out of your hands.
AID00117733	How much do you know about what happened with the NCR at Bitter Springs?
AID00117734	You won't be having problems with intelligence leaks anymore.
AID00117735	No? What happened?
AID00117736	I know who bombed the monorail.
AID00117737	What? Who?
AID00117738	What do you need me to do?
AID00117739	I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
AID00117740	Scientific discovery is never so simple as that.
AID00117741	Isn't it? One directs one's efforts - or the efforts of others - toward a goal, and progress is made. It's a matter of incentives, nothing more.
AID00117742	Tell me more.
AID00117743	Good! I thought I sensed a kindred soul in you, beneath the wasteland veneer.
AID00117744	I had some other questions.
AID00117745	Actually, I had some other questions.
AID00117746	Oh? What might those be?
AID00117747	Anything else I should know?
AID00117748	I thought it was a fairly straightforward assignment. It's a simple question of retrieving the data, which shouldn't prove overly challenging.
AID00117749	Downloading the data will be handled by your Pip-Boy. You might think of yourself as a mere means of conveyance. No insult intended, of course.
AID00117750	I'll think about it.
AID00117751	Very well. I hope you'll consider this an open offer from the OSI. Now, I'm sure your time is valuable, so unless there was anything else...
AID00117752	All right. I'll do it.
AID00117753	Good. No need to check in with the NCR authorities, I can authorize your payment from OSI accounts.
AID00117754	Vaults typically contain a server room on a lower level, where they would have backed up their research data. A computer room, you understand?
AID00117755	Download all the information on the central server to your Pip-Boy. And you'll be certain to bring me any notes or samples that you find, won't you?
AID00117756	Get to the point.
AID00117757	Fair enough. My point is this. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
AID00117758	Nothing is impossible.
AID00117759	Precisely. Science has proven that truth a thousand times over, but how many wasteland savages believe it? Present company excepted, of course.
AID00117760	The bounty I described to you is no idle fantasy. It exists, in primitive form, only a few miles from where we stand.
AID00117761	We need only reach out and unlock its secret. For that, the OSI needs you.
AID00117762	Yes, I'd say so.
AID00117763	A realist. We have that in common. A year ago, I'd have said the same.
AID00117764	But what if I was to tell you that the wasteland can yield an endless bounty, and that the secret may lie a mere few miles from where we stand...
AID00117765	We need only reach out and take it. And for that, I need you.
AID00117766	Save the sales pitch. Just tell me what you want me to do.
AID00117767	All right. Straight to the point. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
AID00117768	Plants are spilling from their gate. No one tends them. No one waters them. Yet they multiply and spread in all directions.
AID00117769	Find the reason for this miraculous growth, and I promise you, the OSI will see that you are generously compensated.
AID00117770	I'm listening.
AID00117771	Imagine, if you will, the wasteland in bloom... vast fields of corn that grow from seeds and produce their bounty in the space of a month...
AID00117772	...orchards of trees, their branches weighed halfway to the ground, hung with fat, ripe oranges. A harvest that could feed a city... or a nation.
AID00117773	And all this... all this... requiring no more than a few of drops of precious water, and the efforts of only a handful of human farmers. Impossible?
AID00117774	Forget it. I don't have time for this.
AID00117775	Of course not! You're obviously a busy man. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
AID00117776	Of course not! I can see you're a woman of consequence. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
AID00117777	I'll think about it, and maybe I'll be back.
AID00117778	Naturally! Take all the time you need.
AID00117779	I assure you, the OSI places considerable value upon our contractors. We will take good care of you, should you decide to accept our offer.
AID00117780	Depends. How much are you paying?
AID00117781	Ha ha! A mercenary, is that it? You won't be disappointed, I promise you. The Office of Science and Industry provides highly competitive benefits.
AID00117782	And as an external contractor, your pay would be... rather more competitive than those of our regular employees.
AID00117783	But we should keep that to ourselves, don't you think?
AID00117784	So... how about I tell you what we need, and then you can tell me whether you're up to it? No pressure, of course.
AID00117785	Where do you get your water?
AID00117786	The NCR fixed up the pipe network pretty good, and water merchants like me are allowed to have some of it to sell.
AID00117787	If we have a water license, of course. Still, it beats the inconvenience of having to trek all the way to the lake to resupply.
AID00117788	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00117789	Glad to do it.
AID00117790	Goodbye.
AID00117791	Until next time!
AID00117792	I'll be right back - there's something I need to double-check.
AID00117793	I'll be waiting.
AID00117794	You'd be surprised what some people are capable of.
AID00117795	That doesn't implicate Crenshaw any more than it does anyone else.
AID00117796	This isn't the resolution I was looking for when I assigned you to this.
AID00117797	Given the dubious circumstances under which the confession took place, the NCR can't compensate you.
AID00117798	Ordinarily I'd have to arrest you for this. But we can hardly afford to waste resources in the wake of all that's happened.
AID00117799	I think your freedom is compensation enough for whatever it is you've done here, don't you?
AID00117800	[Speech] He confessed it to me. Right before he died.
AID00117801	[FAILED] That's not exactly airtight.
AID00117802	[Speech] He confessed it to me before he died. He used the word "frumentarius."
AID00117803	[SUCCEEDED] That's what the Legion calls their spies. I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
AID00117804	If only we'd caught this sooner, before he got to the monorail...
AID00117805	Still, this investigation has been valuable to us, and you deserve to be compensated for it.
AID00117806	The NCR appreciates the work you've done. Will there be anything else?
AID00117807	He had explosives and plans for the operation bearing Caesar's emblem.
AID00117808	He had explosives and plans for the operation bearing Caesar's emblem.
AID00117809	I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
AID00117810	Private Crenshaw. He's dead now.
AID00117811	Crenshaw... I've met Crenshaw. At his disciplinary hearing. Still, this is hard to imagine - he was just a prankster.
AID00117812	Who are the Fiends?
AID00117813	[Speech] I've been fighting for the wrong side. Let me prove myself to you.
AID00117814	[SUCCEEDED] I'll believe it when I see it. You've got one shot, and you're on a tight leash. I'll be watching.
AID00117815	[FAILED] Forget it. We have no use for you here.
AID00117816	We don't have much to go on right now. Lately every raiding party in New Vegas seems to have a map of our troop movements.
AID00117817	It derails everything. Supplies, reinforcements. And it'll only get worse, the longer we let it go on.
AID00117818	Captain Curtis is heading up the investigation right now. He can fill you in.
AID00117819	I'll go to Vault 3 and see if I can find your ranger.
AID00117820	That Vault is a hornet's nest. If you have second thoughts, no one would think less of you for it. But if you can get him home, it'd mean a lot.
AID00117821	Watch for civilians, too. The Fiends have been kidnapping locals. They just walk right into people's homes in the middle of the day and take them.
AID00117822	But the man you're looking for is Bryce Anders. Anders was trying to find the leader, Motor-runner.
AID00117823	You hear something like a chainsaw, you've found Motor-runner. Put a bullet in his head, and you'll have some new friends around here.
AID00117824	Then it wouldn't matter if I mentioned our deal to the colonel?
AID00117825	All right. Fair enough. No need to bring the military into this matter - it's between the two of us, after all.
AID00117826	...and make sure you have some healthy competition.
AID00117827	There's... there's no need to do anything rash. Naturally, OSI would be willing to negotiate for exclusive rights to that data.
AID00117828	Here. Take these caps. That's all of my contracting budget, and it's yours.
AID00117829	Now, I've... got to get back to work. I'm sure you understand. Exit's over there, you can show yourself out.
AID00117830	What contract? You cut an under-the-table deal with me.
AID00117831	[SUCCEEDED] You're saying that I didn't file the proper paperwork, is that it? I suppose you're an expert on NCR procedures?
AID00117832	All right. Then I'll sell this data to some other interested party...
AID00117833	[SUCCEEDED] Now... wait a minute...
AID00117834	I'd be careful with that data. You didn't see those plants in the Vault.
AID00117835	Your concerns are perfectly understandable, but I assure you, they're entirely misplaced. We would never use a technology that wasn't fully tested.
AID00117836	We aren't some motley band of Vault alchemists. We're with the government, for goodness sake. Have a little faith in us!
AID00117837	I agree, I've more than done my part. You owe me more caps.
AID00117838	You want to renegotiate your contract. Mm. This is a very serious matter, you do understand that, don't you?
AID00117839	I realize that one's word counts for little in the wasteland, but amongst civilized people, one doesn't just... demand more than one has agreed to.
AID00117840	Glad to be of service.
AID00117841	A pleasure working with you, really! I'll make certain that you're mentioned in the final report, you have my word on it.
AID00117842	Fine. Just give me my reward.
AID00117843	I knew you were a reasonable person. Here you are... our agreed-upon sum.
AID00117844	By the way... you never warned me about the dangers in that place.
AID00117845	Didn't I? Did you encounter undue difficulties? Clearly not, or you wouldn't be standing here, would you?
AID00117846	All that matters is whether the data is intact...
AID00117847	No problem. I can wait.
AID00117848	I think...  Williams' decryption algorithms seem to be working...
AID00117849	Yes... here it is! The data is mostly uncorrupted. This will make the board of directors finally sit up and take notice...
AID00117850	Here, then... as promised. An agreeable sum, payable upon delivery of the data. You've more than done your part.
AID00117851	Never mind. I'll be back later.
AID00117852	You won't keep me in suspense for long, I hope? Of course I can't authorize any payments until I have the data in hand...
AID00117853	I've brought the data from Vault 22.
AID00117854	Wonderful! Excellent work! Let me see it... it'll take a moment to decode on my terminal...
AID00117855	You said you were the Director of OSI?
AID00117856	Director of the entire OSI? Me? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to plant seditious ideas in my head. Ha ha ha.
AID00117857	No, I direct our eastern operations. I've been responsible for squeezing unprecedented levels of power from the Dam.
AID00117858	I'm also confronting the problem of food production, in what little spare time I have. But I've found some promising leads.
AID00117859	Tell me more about the OSI.
AID00117860	The Office of Science and Industry. That's a rather expansive topic. I could talk for hours, but I'm sure I'd bore you.
AID00117861	Suffice to say, we are the leading edge of the NCR. Our work focuses on practical matters. Medicine, engineering, biology.
AID00117862	The Dam, for instance. OSI routes its energy supply to our cities in the west. That's only one responsibility of this office.
AID00117863	Goodbye.
AID00117864	Yes... goodbye.
AID00117865	This doesn't sound like my kind of job.
AID00117866	I'm very sorry to hear that. If you should change your mind, the offer will stand. As will the substantial reward...
AID00117867	This all sounds a little hard to believe.
AID00117868	Skepticism can be forgiven. But I think you'll come around... if the reports I've heard are true.
AID00117869	Well... consider it a down payment on future service.
AID00117870	[FAILED] No, I'm sure I won't require your services in the future. The OSI does not enter into long-term arrangements with its contractors.
AID00117871	Of course, we're all very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
AID00117872	BUGGED LINE BELOW
AID00117873	[FAILED] If you are unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
AID00117874	In the future, I'm sure you'll consider your agreements and contracts more carefully. Now, here is the sum we agreed to.
AID00117875	Of course, we're very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
AID00117876	VSenLinAgree
AID00117877	PrimmTyroneNeverMind
AID00117878	What am I doing here? What are you doing here?
AID00117879	Why I'm here is my business. If you don't have a question for me then get lost.
AID00117880	Never mind, I'm leaving now.
AID00117881	Make yourself scarce. If you get yourself in trouble, I'm not going to cover your back.
AID00117882	What can you tell me about this place?
AID00117883	What are you looking to find out?
AID00117884	I was sent here by Colonel Hsu.
AID00117885	Hsu sent you? This was my mission!
AID00117886	He sent you? Why?
AID00117887	<Lie> Colonel Hsu sent me here to find you.
AID00117888	The monorail is destroyed.
AID00117889	Goddamn it! How could I have let this happen?
AID00117890	I caught Curtis radioing intel to Caesar's Legion. I had to take him down.
AID00117891	Curtis? Something's not right. He came to me today saying he was worried about the monorail. Had me put him in charge of the inspection crew.
AID00117892	Listen, you've got to get to the monorail. If it's been sabotaged, we're completely crippled here. Go!
AID00117893	It was Curtis. He's in the Legion. I can prove he tried to blow up the monorail.
AID00117894	Curtis? He's been in the NCR long before our conflict with the Legion. There's just no way...
AID00117895	I hope you're mistaken, but somehow I don't think so. It'd explain a lot. This is much worse than anyone expected. There could be others, too.
AID00117896	You've done everything that was asked of you. You have my personal thanks for this, and I'll make sure you receive the credit you deserve.
AID00117897	I'll have Curtis taken into custody. If he lets himself be taken alive, that is.
AID00117898	[Attack] I did. Right before I assassinated the colonel.
AID00117899	You're getting ahead of yourself.
AID00117900	VSenLinNoEggs
AID00117901	VSenLinHaveEggs
AID00117902	VGrigorskyAgree
AID00117903	I've got connections.  Maybe we could make an arrangement?
AID00117904	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
AID00117905	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
AID00117906	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
AID00117907	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
AID00117908	I've got caps.  Name your price.
AID00117909	I can be pretty resourceful.  Perhaps we could work out a deal?
AID00117910	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
AID00117911	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
AID00117912	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
AID00117913	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
AID00117914	Come on, man.  Hook me up.
AID00117915	[50 caps] Maybe some caps will clarify things.
AID00117916	Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
AID00117917	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
AID00117918	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
AID00117919	Nevermind.
AID00117920	What do you need then?
AID00117921	What kind of supplies did you have in mind?
AID00117922	For you? Just the basics. Come back when you're a little more seasoned and maybe we could talk about other options.
AID00117923	Bad business if someone hurts themselves using your products, you know? Gets all kinds of unwanted attention.
AID00117924	Are you implying I have some kind of secret under-the-table stash I only offer to certain clients? Because that could get a man in trouble.
AID00117925	What's the hold-up - if you don't mind my asking?
AID00117926	What's it look like? I caught one in the leg. I killed a dozen of those degenerates sneaking my way in... but one got a drop on me.
AID00117927	I holed up in here after I killed that one. They're too stupid to unlock the doors, so I knew they'd figure whoever attacked had just taken off.
AID00117928	I just need day or two and then I'll take out Motor-Runner myself. I even got the key to his Maintenance Wing. Situation's under control.
AID00117929	I'll leave you to it then.
AID00117930	Let me take out Motor-Runner for you.
AID00117931	Bad idea on all sorts of levels. Leave it to the professionals, kid.
AID00117932	SPEECH attempt to convince Bryce to help take out Motor-Runner
AID00117933	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight. Here, take the key...
AID00117934	Here, take this key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner a whole easier. I'll follow you down.
AID00117935	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
AID00117936	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight.
AID00117937	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
AID00117938	Well, this whole thing's improvised, and now we'll have to improvise some more and find another way through. I'll follow you down.
AID00117939	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
AID00117940	[FAILED] Thanks for the offer - but the answer is no. Once my leg is healed up, I'll take care of Motor-Runner easily enough.
AID00117941	Let's you and me take out Motor-Runner together!
AID00117942	I want to help you rescue the hostages.
AID00117943	Yeah? Nice thought, but that's not my primary mission. If you want to go it solo, more power to you.
AID00117944	I'm sure you can handle it alone. I'll leave you to it.
AID00117945	Good idea. Try not to get hurt out there.
AID00117946	Colonel Hsu thinks you need additional support.
AID00117947	Is that right? And what sort of support, exactly, is it that you have to offer?
AID00117948	The Colonel was concerned. You missed your check-in.
AID00117949	You can go back to old Hsu and tell him that the mission will be completed. I just need a couple more days.
AID00117950	Who are the Fiends?
AID00117951	The Fiends are degenerate drug addicts who kill and rape for fun, basically. They're human garbage - though I'm not sure about the human part.
AID00117952	What is this place?
AID00117953	This was Vault 3, but I'm sure you can tell that by all the 3s all over the damn place. Now it is a drug den for the goddamn Fiends.
AID00117954	What can you tell me about what happened here?
AID00117955	The Fiends killed everyone living here, and now they are squatting in their home.
AID00117956	Have you noticed anything suspicious lately?
AID00117957	Now what kind of MP would I be if I didn't notice anything suspicious?
AID00117958	I've had soldiers go AWOL, break-ins, thefts, you name it.
AID00117959	Do you need any help?
AID00117960	No, I've got this one. I don't think he's going to have much information of value, so I'm just tormenting him for fun. Thanks, though.
AID00117961	Yeah, so far this has gone exactly as expected - poorly. But with the work you've done for NCR already, you might be just what I've been looking for.
AID00117962	We captured an honest-to-God centurion of Caesar's Legion recently.
AID00117963	Sorry, this is state business, what I'm working on. You'd have to do a lot more NCR ass-kissing before they'd let you help me with this one.
AID00117964	Who are you?
AID00117965	Not big on reading nametags, huh? That's okay, my name is long and difficult to pronounce. Ready for it?
AID00117966	It's Boyd. Lieutenant Boyd to my friends. Colonel Hsu has me handling the policing duties for the base.
AID00117967	I've told him he could make my job a whole lot easier if he would just let me shoot anyone who talks back to me, but you know how colonels can be.
AID00117968	Let me take another look at that leg.
AID00117969	How's it look, doc?
AID00117970	I don't have a spare doctor's bag I can spare.
AID00117971	Yeah? Well, there's a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Maybe you can find one and bring it back to me. It'd be a great help...
AID00117972	I'll check in with you and Colonel Hsu when it's done.
AID00117973	All right. Let me give you the key to the Maintenance Wing...
AID00117974	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
AID00117975	I don't know what to say. You'll have to find your own way to get at that sick bastard. Hope to see you back at McCarran.
AID00117976	Here, take this. It's the key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner that much easier. Good luck.
AID00117977	I have a doctor's bag right here. It should be enough to get you on your feet.
AID00117978	What are we waiting for? I've got a high-value target to kill!
AID00117979	Thanks, doc. The Fiends have got a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Here's hoping a doctor's bag is in the mix.
AID00117980	You need a doctor's bag. I'll find one and come back.
AID00117981	If you head for McCarran now, I think you'll make it in time - even at a limp.
AID00117982	Goddammit. Fine. I'll head back. Are you saying you'll handle Motor-Runner yourself?
AID00117983	MEDICINE attempt to convince Bryce
AID00117984	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit. I know. Was just hoping that, uh...
AID00117985	Are you trained as a doctor? Can you fix my leg?
AID00117986	I'm afraid your leg looks - and smells - like it's on the verge of infection.
AID00117987	[FAILED] The slug went straight through. I'm a goddamned NCR ranger, all right? I'm trained in first aid!
AID00117988	A day or two of resting up isn't going to heal that leg.
AID00117989	Then you broke our agreement. I want double the caps.
AID00117990	[FAILED] No. Our agreement was very specific. You bring me the data, I give you a reward.
AID00117991	We never discussed the dangers. That's your business, not mine. If you can't provide the data, I'm sure I'll find someone who can.
AID00117992	It doesn't trouble you that you sent eight or ten people to their deaths?
AID00117993	I have no evidence that they're dead. A thousand things could have happened between here and the Vault.
AID00117994	They could have changed their minds and walked away. I wouldn't be much of a scientist if I leapt to conclusions without proof.
AID00117995	Goodbye.
AID00117996	I want double the caps. Or I spread the word that you're full of shit.
AID00117997	[SUCCEEDED] All right. I'll admit that it's been difficult to find anyone willing to enter the Vault. And I'd rather get the data sooner than later.
AID00117998	You have a deal. I'll double your reward, if you bring me the data. But this is as high as my budget will allow.
AID00117999	Maybe I should cancel our deal.
AID00118000	Do whatever you think is best. You're under no obligations. If you want the caps, you'll complete the job. Simple.
AID00118001	Take my advice. Forget about Williams. She's a talented researcher, but she doesn't understand people, and she can't see the big picture.
AID00118002	Now, I know your time is valuable, so I won't waste any more of it. Feel free to show yourself out...
AID00118003	I prefer to know what I'm getting myself into.
AID00118004	You want certainty? You'll never find it... especially not in the pursuit of science.
AID00118005	How many others have you sent to the Vault?
AID00118006	I'd have to consult my records. Eight? Ten? Your point is what?
AID00118007	No, that was me. I fixed HELIOS One.
AID00118008	I... see. Of course you did.
AID00118009	Fantastic.
AID00118010	Yes! That was it, exactly.
AID00118011	Do you control the Dam from here?
AID00118012	Directly? No. But we attempt to maximize its output. You have no idea how difficult it is to provide power to an entire nation.
AID00118013	Fortunately, we also have the HELIOS One facility. One of our external contractors recently got the station up and running.
AID00118014	Fortunately, we also have the HELIOS One facility. One of our external contractors recently got the station up and running.
AID00118015	We were starting to bring the HELIOS One facility online, as well. That might have increased our power output by half.
AID00118016	But some wasteland scum managed to sabotage the array. Probably got quite a laugh at our expense. Very funny indeed.
AID00118017	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that he'd ever show his face in a place like this.
AID00118018	We were starting to bring the HELIOS One facility online, as well. That might have increased our power output by half.
AID00118019	But some wasteland scum managed to sabotage the array. Probably got quite a laugh at our expense. Very funny indeed.
AID00118020	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that she'd ever show her face in a place like this.
AID00118021	Our efforts at HELIOS One held a great deal of promise, until some drifter blew in from the waste and managed to reroute the power.
AID00118022	As to where the power is going... who knows. Can you imagine? A drifter outsmarting professional scientists? Only in New Vegas.
AID00118023	We'd hoped that HELIOS One would boost power to McCarran and Vegas. Then some damned crusader routed all the power to Freeside.
AID00118024	I also have high hopes for our HELIOS One facility. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the two "scientists" who are working there.
AID00118025	So far, they've only managed to achieve one percent power output. I'd send help, if I could spare the personnel.
AID00118026	His name was something like... "Exceptional" or "Marvelous" or...
AID00118027	That's the trouble with this wasteland - too many damned variables. No one can account for them all.
AID00118028	NCR has a food shortage?
AID00118029	Not yet. But our government understands the value of proactive thought. Our studies project an imbalance between production and consumption.
AID00118030	Or, for a layman such as yourself - not enough food, too many mouths to feed. Mass starvation. In a decade or so.
AID00118031	You're doing all these things yourself?
AID00118032	Yes. With the assistance of my team, of course.
AID00118033	Yes, I have. What difference does it make?
AID00118034	None at all. Informed speculation on my part. Williams is very good at her job, so it remains secure... despite her best efforts.
AID00118035	No, you aren't the first person I've sent to the Vault. I'm sorry that I neglected to tell you, but I don't see how it makes any difference.
AID00118036	<Lie> No, Williams didn't tell me anything.
AID00118037	All right. I'll take you at your word. Williams didn't say anything at all, you just came to this conclusion on your own.
AID00118038	I'm the one asking the questions, Dr. Hildern.
AID00118039	Fair enough. Begging your pardon, but this is beginning to feel like an interrogation.
AID00118040	Goodbye.
AID00118041	I'm not the first person you've sent to Vault 22... am I?
AID00118042	I never said you were. You've been speaking to Williams, haven't you?
AID00118043	I have some questions.
AID00118044	BMRhondaBadReunion
AID00118045	Oh no! Miss Tabitha is hurt! Someone, get a doctor!
AID00118046	There, there Miss Tabitha. It's going to be all right.
AID00118047	Miss Tabitha, your distinct lack of respiration is quite worrisome.
AID00118048	That's good, Miss Tabitha. It's important that you don't move. You might aggravate your injury.
AID00118049	Where is that doctor?
AID00118050	Don't worry, Miss Tabitha, I'll keep you warm with my exhaust.
AID00118051	I do hope the doctor doesn't get lost on the way up here.
AID00118052	<Lie>I'm an independent contractor with the NCR.
AID00118053	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my apologies sir. I was sent here by Colonel Hsu to exterminate Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
AID00118054	[FAILED] Your curiosity and a few caps will get you a rat on a stick, but it won't get you fuck all from me.
AID00118055	I'm just curious.
AID00118056	Tell me what an NCR ranger is doing here.
AID00118057	Tell me why I should tell you anything. I don't know you.
AID00118058	Let's talk about something else.
AID00118059	Okay, but make it quick.
AID00118060	By the way, that Vault was just as dangerous as Williams thought.
AID00118061	I don't see how that's relevant. The dangers of the Vault were your business, not mine. The only question is whether the data is still intact.
AID00118062	Was it? I'm sure I made it very clear... the hazards of the job were your business, not mine. The important question is whether this data is intact.
AID00118063	Damn right. No thanks to you.
AID00118064	I'm sorry you feel that way. But we both came out ahead, so... no harm done, I hope.
AID00118065	Make it fast. I want my caps.
AID00118066	If the data's intact, you'll get your reward. I gave my word. I'm not the kind of wasteland savage you're used to dealing with.
AID00118067	All right. I'll investigate Vault 22.
AID00118068	Goodbye.
AID00118069	I just have some questions.
AID00118070	What else can you tell me about Anders?
AID00118071	I don't know him very well, myself. I seem to remember that he was the man to call on if you needed someone to get in and get out quietly.
AID00118072	Colonel Hsu would really be the person to talk to.
AID00118073	Let's talk about something else.
AID00118074	Suit yourself.
AID00118075	I'll see what I can find out about Cpl. White for you.
AID00118076	Word around the base is he'd been going regularly to visit a hooker named Dazzle at Gomorrah. That's a casino on the Strip. Classy place.
AID00118077	His belongings are up in the barracks in the concourse building. First bunk on your left if you're facing in from the center.
AID00118078	I haven't had a chance to look through his things yet, so that might be a good place to begin.
AID00118079	You said there have been thefts?
AID00118080	Yeah. We keep coming up short on our weekly supply inventory checks. Guns and ammo, mostly. Not the kind of things you like to see go missing.
AID00118081	No witnesses yet. I've got my money on Sergeant Contreras, who's supposed to be in charge of distribution, the little weasel.
AID00118082	But he's too slick to let anyone catch him doing it. We've searched his possessions a dozen times. Nothing.
AID00118083	Tell me about the break-ins.
AID00118084	Maybe break-in isn't the right word. We didn't find signs of forced entry. But I've had reports of someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
AID00118085	It's probably just a meeting spot for a steamy military base love affair. <Sighs> Kids today.
AID00118086	But it bothers me that they didn't break in. It means they have an access code. Most soldiers around the base don't have that.
AID00118087	Who's missing?
AID00118088	Well, there's Anders. He's a Ranger. That one's not suspicious so much as worrisome - he left on a dangerous assignment.
AID00118089	Colonel Hsu sent him out. Now I think he feels guilty not having any way to check up on him.
AID00118090	Goodbye.
AID00118091	See you later!
AID00118092	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00118093	Sure thing!
AID00118094	Anything else I can do for you?
AID00118095	Why is this water so special?
AID00118096	'Cause it's clean. The crops taste funny if you don't use clean water, but the NCR won't give us any and it's too expensive to buy.
AID00118097	I didn't come here to do your job for you.
AID00118098	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing. Maybe you'll brave up and do the right thing. Good luck.
AID00118099	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing.
AID00118100	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
AID00118101	That's it. I'm heading for McCarran. Good luck to you.
AID00118102	I'm not interested in doing that right now.
AID00118103	You sure? You're missing out. Well, you're always welcome, if you should change your mind.
AID00118104	Okay. Let's get started.
AID00118105	That's the spirit. Okay, I'll go in and have a word with him. Then I'll call you in.
AID00118106	Have you tried calling him hurtful names?
AID00118107	Yes, and one time I thought I saw a tear when I told him his uniform was unflattering. But I think he just got some dust in his eye.
AID00118108	What about a truth drug?
AID00118109	Don't have anything like that. Sounds nice. Like the kind of thing I'd want to take home and use on my husband.
AID00118110	But even if we did, I don't know that I'd be comfortable using it. If there's any risk of overdose, it's not worth it. Asshole's too valuable.
AID00118111	Why don't you just beat your prisoner senseless?
AID00118112	I like the way you think. Have I said that yet?
AID00118113	Problem is that the NCR frowns on using that sort of tactic. There are some restrictions still in place from President Tandi's administration.
AID00118114	But here's my favorite thing about you - you're not in the NCR. Plus, for all this guy knows, you're completely insane. That's a winning combination.
AID00118115	I'll keep an eye out for your missing supplies.
AID00118116	Good. The more guns you can recover, the more I'll be able to use to shoot Contreras for being inept.
AID00118117	I've got the whiskey.
AID00118118	The Vault 22 data is gone. Destroyed.
AID00118119	Destroyed. Really. I find that hard to believe. More likely, you failed to locate the proper server.
AID00118120	You're researching all these problems yourself?
AID00118121	So... you wanted something more?
AID00118122	[FAILED] That was years ago. No point in discussing it. We have more practical concerns... and more important things to talk about.
AID00118123	Doesn't sound like a good place for a person of ambition.
AID00118124	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly right. Imagine what the Followers could have accomplished if they were properly motivated... if they had a unified purpose!
AID00118125	Those of us who founded the OSI... we wanted to put our knowledge to work. And we have, to some degree.
AID00118126	But the execs at OSI Central... they're still bound to the old ideas. Society of equals, and all that. There's still too little direction.
AID00118127	If I can make real breakthroughs here... show the President what can be done when junior researchers are kept in line... kept focused on task...
AID00118128	Who knows. Maybe I'll be sitting in OSI Central, in a few years time. And there'll be no more coddling of "free spirits" like our friend, Williams.
AID00118129	And what do the Followers believe?
AID00118130	Knowledge for knowledge sake. A society of equals. They purport to be intelligent people, and then they spout this old-world dogma.
AID00118131	So who *did* train you?
AID00118132	Before the bombs, I might have studied at any number of colleges, universities. They gave a man a chance to advance himself... or so I've heard.
AID00118133	But after the bombs - until a few years ago - anyone with half a brain had one choice. The Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00118134	Didn't matter if you agreed with them or not. You either played along or you were turned away.
AID00118135	You didn't always work for the OSI?
AID00118136	No, I... no. The OSI hasn't been around for very long. I received my training elsewhere.
AID00118137	Why terminate her contract?
AID00118138	Williams has a tendency to feel before she thinks. Not in the lab. But everywhere else.
AID00118139	That might be forgivable if she kept her concerns to herself. But she doesn't. Not in front of her peers, not even with contractors like yourself.
AID00118140	That kind of behavior can undermine morale. She convinced my last contractor to quit. Same way she tried with you.
AID00118141	Probably didn't tell you that, did she?
AID00118142	Goodbye.
AID00118143	Best of luck to you. Not that you'll need it. You seem like a reasonably competent person...
AID00118144	No. "Civilized" people stack the deck in their own favor, don't they?
AID00118145	If you're unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
AID00118146	In the future, I'm sure you'll consider your agreements and contracts more carefully. Now, here is the sum we agreed to.
AID00118147	I just have some questions.
AID00118148	Yes. Tell me about it.
AID00118149	What do you think of NCR's chances against the Legion?
AID00118150	To be frank, I have no idea. I leave the fighting to Colonel Hsu, and I expect him to leave the science to me.
AID00118151	Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have.
AID00118152	Never mind. Goodbye.
AID00118153	Never mind. Goodbye.
AID00118154	I had some other questions.
AID00118155	What's your opinion of Williams?
AID00118156	Williams is an admirable researcher. If she wasn't, I'd have terminated her contract, and she'd be begging for work from my former employers.
AID00118157	Believe whatever you want. It's the truth.
AID00118158	Keely. It was Keely, wasn't it? Who else would fail to give a fuck that thousands of people are going to starve, without that data?
AID00118159	And for what? So Keely can wage her selfish little war against me and the OSI.
AID00118160	The plants in that vault were dangerous. We destroyed the data.
AID00118161	We? We?! You were a part of this? After we made an explicit agreement, you have the fucking gall to destroy priceless scientific data?
AID00118162	The authorities are going to hear about this. They're going to know your name, they're going to know your goddamn face.
AID00118163	Keely wiped the data. It's gone.
AID00118164	Keely. Again. Do you... do you understand what that rotting old bitch has done?! Thousands of people, mass starvation. We had a chance to avoid that.
AID00118165	And I had a chance to prove that scientists could be more than a bunch of useless idealists. But Keely doesn't give a goddamn about that, does she?
AID00118166	You're an accomplice in this. Keely is one old woman - you could have easily stopped her. You're either incompetent, or you were on her side.
AID00118167	Now get out of this office. Get out!
AID00118168	Right...  Well, I'll keep that in mind.
AID00118169	Be sure you do.
AID00118170	If you get this last job done, full access to my stash. At a discount, even. Just because I like you.
AID00118171	Get moving, watch out for raiders, and do not lose that package. Good Luck.
AID00118172	I'm ready for the next task.
AID00118173	Well, I'm not. Come back tomorrow and the stuff will be ready to transport.
AID00118174	All right, I need you to pass something off to a merchant. The guy's name is Price. The exchange goes down at Miguel's Pawn Shop in Westside.
AID00118175	This next bit is very important. He's paranoid. Maybe a little schizo. You have to identify yourself with a passcode or he'll shoot you right there.
AID00118176	Just tell him you're looking for some betting advice. Then he'll say the surest move is to bet on the house.
AID00118177	Here are the medical supplies from Blake.
AID00118178	See, you're practically stealing caps from me, this work is so easy.
AID00118179	There's one more job. It's a little more complicated, but I think you're up to it.
AID00118180	I need to get some stuff sorted around. Gonna take me a day or two, so just stop back in a few days.
AID00118181	[Attack] Uh oh. Now you've made me angry.
AID00118182	I can take anything you've got.
AID00118183	You're about to tell me everything you know, Silus.
AID00118184	Of course, of course. All you had to do was ask. I'll tell you everything I know.
AID00118185	Let's see. I know that you're a brainless cretin. I know that you're wasting your time. I know the lieutenant is going to be disappointed in you.
AID00118186	And I know that by this time next month the streets of New Vegas will be decorated with the decaying heads of NCR soldiers.
AID00118187	Is there anything else you wanted to know?
AID00118188	[Speech] You... *smell* like excrement. So there.
AID00118189	[FAILED] I must admit that a conversation with an imbecile may be far worse than the kind of torture I was anticipating.
AID00118190	But somehow I think I'll manage.
AID00118191	[Speech] I think you're confused. I'm with the excrement right now.
AID00118192	[?] You must have some reason to be in your line of work. Tell me, what did the Legion do to you?
AID00118193	Did we enslave your children? Slaughter your family before your eyes to teach you a lesson?
AID00118194	Whatever it was, I hope I was there to give the order.
AID00118195	<Lie> I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
AID00118196	[?] You're nothing. You're some inept mercenary the NCR is paying to supplement its own incompetent soldiers.
AID00118197	[?] What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
AID00118198	I'm a friend of the Legion. I'm here to help.
AID00118199	Caesar's eyes truly are everywhere. And here I thought they'd send assassins instead. Did the officer send you?
AID00118200	What officer?
AID00118201	I don't know what name he goes by here. But I saw him when they brought me in, and I recognized him.
AID00118202	When I saw him last it was ages ago. He was training to be an agent of Caesar's frumentarii. Apparently he passed the trials.
AID00118203	And what a job he's done, to achieve such a rank. I have no doubt he'll deliver a crippling blow to the NCR while he's here. Perhaps many.
AID00118204	I have heard that he has been radioing high-level NCR intelligence back to Caesar's camp virtually every night.
AID00118205	But never mind that now. We don't have much time. If you can get me a weapon, the rest will be easy.
AID00118206	In the hall outside, they still have my possessions in a locker. There's a gun in there that should be small enough to get past the lieutenant.
AID00118207	When she comes back, I want you to go and get it for me. Simple enough?
AID00118208	REPCONHQAlarm
AID00118209	Intruder Alert! Activating Defenses!
AID00118210	Goodbye.
AID00118211	Right. Good luck.
AID00118212	I have some questions.
AID00118213	Of course. Anything.
AID00118214	Not my problem. Keely is on her own.
AID00118215	I know it's not your business to fend for anyone but yourself. If not for her, do it for the caps. That's all I'm asking.
AID00118216	I'll try, but no promises.
AID00118217	That's all I ask. She might even be able to help you. As long as you don't speak too well of Dr. Hildern.
AID00118218	It never came up. Doesn't bother me.
AID00118219	No, I knew the danger wouldn't. I'm not trying to scare you off the job.
AID00118220	Maybe Hildern and I need to have another talk.
AID00118221	No, wait! I don't mean to see any harm come to Dr. Hildern. Unless by "talk" you just mean... talk.
AID00118222	All right. I'll look for her.
AID00118223	I had a good feeling about you. Moment you walked in. I mean it.
AID00118224	No. Hildern didn't mention anyone else.
AID00118225	But now he's hired you. Which means one of two things. Either he heard back from Keely, and she failed, or he's given up on her.
AID00118226	Listen. I make a fair wage, but I'm not rich, not by any means. Maybe my kind of money wouldn't appeal to your average merc.
AID00118227	But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Isn't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
AID00118228	You're right. It's none of your business.
AID00118229	We shouldn't even be talking about this, I know. But I think someone should tell you. You're not the first one he's sent to Vault 22.
AID00118230	Why so interested?
AID00118231	Not interested. More concerned. It's just... you're not the first person he's sent to Vault 22. And I know he'd never tell you.
AID00118232	Yes. He asked me to get some data from Vault 22.
AID00118233	I shouldn抰 say anything, I know that. But you抮e not the first person Hildern's sent out to the vault.
AID00118234	There were a lot of mercs. One after another. None of them came back.
AID00118235	Then, about a week ago, there was a scientist. Keely. She's unusual, not the sort of person you'd expect, but she's an absolute genius, and...
AID00118236	And he didn't mention her? Not even her name? Or any of the other mercs?
AID00118237	Goodbye.
AID00118238	Nice to meet you. If you need anything, I'm almost always in the lab.
AID00118239	Mercenaries? What for?
AID00118240	I can't say. We're not supposed to talk about the research. Not the details. If you're interested, I'm sure he'd see you.
AID00118241	Need help with anything?
AID00118242	You mean... give you work? No, that'd be up to the administrator. Hildern. He's back there in his office.
AID00118243	Between you and me, I don't think he ever leaves. Plenty of mercs go in to see him, though.
AID00118244	What's your role here?
AID00118245	Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
AID00118246	Are you a scientist?
AID00118247	I know I don't sound the part. Get raised by brahmin ranchers, and you never lose the twang. Drives Hildern crazy.
AID00118248	But I know every inch of the power grid from Hoover Dam to Shady Sands. That's what we do here - try to optimize the power output from the Dam.
AID00118249	Some of the others are working on an agricultural project, but... truth be told, they aren't making much progress. Not yet, anyway.
AID00118250	What is this place?
AID00118251	This? The OSI lab. We don't get many visitors. The smell puts people off, I think.
AID00118252	Nobody ever said science would smell clean and fresh. Anyway, you get used to it, if you give it some time.
AID00118253	What was that about salvage and traps?
AID00118254	That's right, the H&H Tools factory on the main drag. It's been sealed for ages, and it's lousy with traps. Still, might be something valuable to you.
AID00118255	What is there to do here?
AID00118256	Keep your nose to the ground, stranger, that's what. Mind your own business and let us mind our own, are we clear?
AID00118257	If you've got a mind to loot the old H&H Tools factory, don't even bother. That place is sealed tighter than a Radscorpion's bunghole.
AID00118258	Every salvager who tries gets blown up, flattened, or gutted by traps. Then he starts to stink up the town and we're the ones to clean up the mess.
AID00118259	If you've got the caps, I'll back any claim you want.
AID00118260	[FAILED] Hmm. Honesty's a good trait, stranger, but I don't deal with mercenaries unless I'm damn sure they can be trusted.
AID00118261	[SUCCEEDED] Spoken like a true mercenary. Well, you seem like you can handle yourself, stranger, and we can use people like that.
AID00118262	We may not squander our wealth like those fools in the Strip, but we take care of our own business. Consider this a token of good faith.
AID00118263	I've got the skills, the will and the firepower. All I expect is a decent reward for my work.
AID00118264	I'm not interested in this, right now.
AID00118265	Suit yourself.
AID00118266	You need somebody with real firepower, and mine's yours for a small fee.
AID00118267	I'm a friend, trust me.
AID00118268	[FAILED] Really? You'll forgive me if I ask you to back that claim up, won't you?
AID00118269	[SUCCEEDED] That's the kind of stuff I like to hear, stranger. All right, we could use someone like you.
AID00118270	I respect your independence, and I'm good at taking care of troubles.
AID00118271	Doesn't the NCR keep order around here?
AID00118272	NCR... did you just crawl out from under a rock? Those folks only care about their business, their people and their pockets.
AID00118273	NCR's order? Don't make me laugh, stranger. We work this land, we own these streets, and we yank up the bad weeds ourselves, got it?
AID00118274	What kind of trouble?
AID00118275	Folks that don't belong. Murderers, rapists, extortionists, and everything in between.
AID00118276	You know, business as usual in North Vegas, stranger.
AID00118277	Need a hand with any trouble?
AID00118278	You want to help us out? What makes you think we want you around here, huh?
AID00118279	Who are you?
AID00118280	Name's Crandon, stranger. I keep an eye out for trouble around here.
AID00118281	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00118282	We've been here for a few years, just looking for a place we can call our own.
AID00118283	Life's harsh, but still, it beats the hell out of the desert. We've got numbers, we've got food, and we've got trade. That's progress, stranger.
AID00118284	Tell me more about your role here.
AID00118285	Jules, myself, and a few others patrol the streets and sewers. Any punks come up out of the rest of the city, we give 'em the run off.
AID00118286	Like I told you, we look out for each other here. Me, Jules, and a few others make sure any trouble stays the hell out of our streets.
AID00118287	Don't worry.  I paid him off.  He won't be a problem.
AID00118288	You bribed a Ranger? Ha! That's gotta be some kind of special talent.
AID00118289	Sounds simple enough. I'll get right on it.
AID00118290	Thanks. Don't come back until you have it. Crimson Caravan is just northeast of the Gun Runners. Blake's usually in the main office.
AID00118291	All right, what's the job?
AID00118292	Great. The Crimson Caravan has something ready for me.
AID00118293	Look for Blake and let him know you're picking up Contreras' medical supplies.
AID00118294	Don't worry.  He won't be telling anyone anything ever again.
AID00118295	Good to hear.
AID00118296	<Hand Contreras the package> Nah, but he is definitely looking for you.
AID00118297	Thank God. You're going to need to take him out.
AID00118298	If McCarran hears I've been selling contraband, we're both dead.
AID00118299	I didn't really have a choice.
AID00118300	Now you're just going to have to take him out. I can't afford having NCR knowing about my side business...
AID00118301	...and I don't think you want to go in front of a firing squad either. You take care of this, my entire stock is available to you.
AID00118302	Hell, I might even throw in something extra to sweeten the deal.
AID00118303	Price is being held by the NCR.  A Ranger replaced him.
AID00118304	Ah shit. Well, please tell me you didn't hand him the package.
AID00118305	Just some supplies for McCarran from the Crimson Caravan.
AID00118306	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
AID00118307	[FAILED] <Takes Contreras' package> Bullshit, lets see what you've got here...
AID00118308	Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make chems. You're under arrest unless you've got a damn good explanation.
AID00118309	<cover package> Oh this?  Nothing important.
AID00118310	He said he would help you.
AID00118311	Great. Let him know we'll be keeping an eye on him. He is free to do business...
AID00118312	But, if he isn't regularly reporting on illegal transactions, he's a dead man.
AID00118313	<Draw Weapon> We agreed you should die.
AID00118314	Contreras will still get his. Killing you will just save me some paperwork.
AID00118315	Nothing. I was just told he was a local merchant I should check out.
AID00118316	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
AID00118317	[FAILED] What's that you're carrying? Looks like some kind of delivery to me...
AID00118318	Oh, just delivering packages.  No clue whats in em, but its really important.
AID00118319	Well, I was given this package to deliver to him.
AID00118320	Let's see... Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make full-blown chems.
AID00118321	Here.  Take this package Contreras gave me.  I don't want any trouble.
AID00118322	I was just told he was a local merchant and to find him to buy some supplies.
AID00118323	<Draw Weapon> Well, I can't just let him be killed. Word of this stops here.
AID00118324	I have Contreras. No one is going to miss you.
AID00118325	Ok. I'll just be on my way then.
AID00118326	Stay out of trouble.
AID00118327	What's going to happen to him?
AID00118328	He'll be shot. We have no tolerance for chem dealers in the military.
AID00118329	
AID00118330	[SUCCEEDED] It might work since he's acting as a major hub for this activity. It's not like he has much choice now that we have evidence.
AID00118331	If you can convince Contreras to work with the Rangers to break up the drug ring, I'll call off the firing squad.
AID00118332	Just report back to me when he's agreed to make the deal.  Otherwise, he's dead.
AID00118333	I'm sure Contreras could work with you.
AID00118334	The way you stand, your weapon, even your armor is fitted in a military fashion.
AID00118335	Hell. Thought I'd done a better job than that. Well, if that's how it is, you can call me Ranger Keller.
AID00118336	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying drug ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
AID00118337	What is your business with Price?
AID00118338	C'mon guy.  You're no merchant.  You've got Ranger all over you.
AID00118339	[SUCCEEDED] What?! How the hell did you figure that out?
AID00118340	[FAILED] Password? That little bastard said nothing about a password.
AID00118341	Price is in NCR custody and you're going to join him, unless you've got a damn good explanation for why you're looking for him.
AID00118342	Hand over your weapons. You're under arrest.
AID00118343	[INT/PER] Hey, that wasn't the right response for the password!
AID00118344	Hey, I'm just the messenger. I didn't know anything about this.
AID00118345	You know what? I believe you.
AID00118346	You're free to go. Contreras, however, won't be moving drugs ever again.
AID00118347	<Draw Weapon> You won't be telling anyone about this.
AID00118348	Heh, an accomplice afterall. Well, it'll save me some paperwork just killing you.
AID00118349	Who the hell are you?
AID00118350	Ranger Keller. I've been undercover for months tracking chems in this area.
AID00118351	This has to be the easiest catch yet.
AID00118352	<Draw Weapon> You'll never take me alive, pig!
AID00118353	Good. Saves me paperwork.
AID00118354	I had no idea that package had chems! Contreras gave it to me!
AID00118355	Contreras, eh? We suspected he was involved somehow.
AID00118356	It looks like you just gave me the evidence I've been looking for.
AID00118357	Close enough.  Yeah, Contreras told me to give Price this package.
AID00118358	Lets see here...
AID00118359	Congratulations, you're under arrest for chem trafficking. Hand over your weapons and come with me.
AID00118360	Um, well...  Nevermind.
AID00118361	Crazy wastelander.
AID00118362	Uh... do you like... gambling?
AID00118363	I'm looking for some betting advice.
AID00118364	Brahmin tipping is a cherished pastime.
AID00118365	What? Look, do you have something to drop off or not?
AID00118366	Have you seen a guy named Price around?
AID00118367	We work together. I'm handling his deliveries for the moment while he handles a business opportunity that came up.
AID00118368	Where's your boss? He'll want to know you were hitting me up for freebies.
AID00118369	Hey! No need, no need! I was just kidding!
AID00118370	Motor-Runner's down in the Maintenance Wing. Straight through the door behind me, down the hall, down the stairs to the right.
AID00118371	I was just kidding about tossing me some Psycho. So you don't got to say anything about that.
AID00118372	Speech Attempt to Gain Entrance
AID00118373	[FAILED] Who the fuck you trying to kid? You're lucky if I let you walk away from this, asshole.
AID00118374	Your boss, um... He summoned me here.
AID00118375	[SUCCEEDED] If you're fucking carrying, just fucking say so. Yeah, deliver to the boss, business as usual.
AID00118376	Motor-Runner's down in the Maintenance Wing. Straight through the door behind me, down the hall, down the stairs to the right.
AID00118377	I'm carrying Jet, Psycho, and other favors. And I don't deliver to the help.
AID00118378	Let's see how tough you are.
AID00118379	All right, asshole, you just fucked yourself!
AID00118380	Isn't this Vault 3, home of the Fiends?
AID00118381	Final warning, asshole. Get the fuck out of here or we are going to waste your ass.
AID00118382	No need to get worked up. I'll leave.
AID00118383	Yeah - fuck off, and be grateful you're still breathing!
AID00118384	VMS07Greeting
AID00118385	This is what I been waiting to see! A big bad Khan bringing in the medicine! How about you toss some psycho my way?
AID00118386	What the fuck are you doing here? You got some kind of fucking death wish, asshole?
AID00118387	I wasn't expecting a resupply so soon, so you have anything from Red Rock Canyon to sell me?
AID00118388	NCR? Here? Not for long.
AID00118389	How the hell did you get in here? Where the fuck are my guards?
AID00118390	Take down this password, it'll get you into the Overseer's area upstairs I think.
AID00118391	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
AID00118392	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
AID00118393	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
AID00118394	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
AID00118395	Thanks for the assistance taking out Motor-Runner. I'll be heading back to McCarran. I'll put in a good word for you.
AID00118396	<Draw Weapon> I think I'll just take my caps back from your corpse.
AID00118397	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, girlie.
AID00118398	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, boy.
AID00118399	<Give 250 caps> Okay, make that 500 caps. I'm sure Contreras can skim for you.
AID00118400	I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
AID00118401	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
AID00118402	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates.  Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
AID00118403	Otherwise, he'll be reported as a traitor selling contraband to the enemy and go in front of a firing squad.
AID00118404	<Give 250 caps> I'm sure Contreras would be willing to work with you...
AID00118405	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
AID00118406	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
AID00118407	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates. Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
AID00118408	[FAILED] You don't bribe a Ranger. You had better have something compelling to say, or you can join Contreras in hell.
AID00118409	He seemed focused on results. Maybe not so much on people.
AID00118410	[SUCCEEDED] He's not what you'd call... warm. Unless he wants something from you. And even then, it's kind of a cold warm.
AID00118411	Most of the time, I focus on the science and try to forget him. He doesn't get mixed up in any actual work. Though he tells people that he does.
AID00118412	That's not much of an endorsement. What do you *really* think?
AID00118413	[FAILED] Wouldn't be right for me to say. He's my boss... and he took a chance, bringing me out here as lead researcher.
AID00118414	Exactly how old is Keely?
AID00118415	I couldn't get her to say. But she talked about the war - the great war, when the bombs fell - like she'd been there.
AID00118416	So I'm guessing... pretty old. Two hundred years? Maybe more.
AID00118417	Goodbye.
AID00118418	Right. Stay safe.
AID00118419	What's your role here?
AID00118420	Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
AID00118421	Hildern mentioned the Followers of the Apocalypse...
AID00118422	My father used say good things about them, but that was years ago... back when they'd teach farmers and ranchers about crop rotation and the like.
AID00118423	Nowadays... they've changed. They're doing what they can to discredit the NCR, give us a bad name with the locals.
AID00118424	Dr. Hildern trained with them, years ago. Not me, though. I'm an OSI girl.
AID00118425	What do you think of Dr. Hildern?
AID00118426	The Director? He's... very well-spoken. And... knowledgeable.
AID00118427	I hear the food around here is pretty bad.
AID00118428	It's foul, to tell the truth. Most people try to get what they can from the outside... even if it's just a smuggled candy bar, now and then.
AID00118429	Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free.
AID00118430	Can you tell me anything else about Keely?
AID00118431	Keely's brilliant... an absolute genius. She plays at being mean, but it's all a front.
AID00118432	When you've lived as long as she has, you get defensive around new people. Who wants to make a friend when you know you'll outlive them?
AID00118433	Goodbye.
AID00118434	Dammit. Now you've made me forget what I was doing...
AID00118435	Then you don't want this invoice from Alice McLafferty?
AID00118436	Fine. I'll see that she's paid. Crimson Caravan always fulfils their contractual obligations to the letter.
AID00118437	Now I assume there's nothing more, so I trust you can see yourself to the door.
AID00118438	I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
AID00118439	From Alice? I'll see that she's paid right away.
AID00118440	Crimson Caravan runs a tight operation, even out here in the waste. Wouldn't do to keep them waiting.
AID00118441	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
AID00118442	I have a few questions.
AID00118443	You mentioned Vault 22. I might be willing to help.
AID00118444	Actually, I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
AID00118445	From Alice? I'll see that she's paid right away.
AID00118446	Crimson Caravan runs a tight operation, even out here in the waste. Wouldn't do to keep them waiting.
AID00118447	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
AID00118448	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
AID00118449	Keely's dead.
AID00118450	Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
AID00118451	No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
AID00118452	Keely was brilliant... she'd seen so much. What a horrible waste...
AID00118453	How do Keely and Hildern get along?
AID00118454	Like a brahmin and a deathclaw. Though I'm not sure which would be which. Bad analogy, maybe - they're both deathclaws, in their way.
AID00118455	Keely hates Hildern. She says he's more politician than scientist, and gets in the way of true discovery.
AID00118456	And Hildern hates Keely because... well, because every time they meet, she makes him look like an ass. In front of important people, usually.
AID00118457	Keely's dead. But I found her research notes.
AID00118458	Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
AID00118459	No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
AID00118460	The notes count for something. I'll keep them safe. Keely's work in the vault won't be lost, and it won't be forgotten.
AID00118461	So Dr. Hildern takes credit for your work?
AID00118462	He sure does. Everyone knows it. I've just got to endure this job until the project is finished.
AID00118463	But abandoning Keely... he crossed a line. Taking credit for other people's work is one thing. Sending people to die in the waste is another.
AID00118464	If Hildern tries to recruit any more mercs, I'm going to warn them. What can he do to me? I'm the only one who can run this lab.
AID00118465	That's it? A few caps and another errand?
AID00118466	You're right. I'm just an under-the-table arms dealer. What could I possibly offer you, a drifting mercenary? Sorry for wasting your time.
AID00118467	Isaac said they'll have the extra guns and ammo in the next shipment.
AID00118468	Very professional. I like that. Maybe you can handle something bigger.
AID00118469	Got anything for sale?
AID00118470	Take your pick.
AID00118471	You need to clean up your reputation or you're going to get me in trouble - I'll have to charge you more to keep from arousing suspicion.
AID00118472	I took care of the Ranger.
AID00118473	Good to hear.
AID00118474	I convinced the Ranger to work with you.  You're safe, but be careful.
AID00118475	No problem.  Consider it done.
AID00118476	Don't come back until his corpse is rotting in the sunlight. The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
AID00118477	He's looking to break up trafficking.  Maybe there is money to be made here...
AID00118478	That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
AID00118479	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
AID00118480	No way. I'm making too much money to just hand him the entire contraband operation. Just kill the bastard.
AID00118481	Killing a Ranger brings big risks.  Killing gets expensive.
AID00118482	[SUCCEEDED] All right, here's a little something in advance. Now get the job done.
AID00118483	[FAILED] You've got brass balls, but no deal. I'm already offering you access to my stash if you take care of this.
AID00118484	Hey man, you never said anything about killing.  Cough up some caps.
AID00118485	We don't have to kill him.  You could work with him and make caps.
AID00118486	[SUCCEEDED] That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
AID00118487	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
AID00118488	[FAILED] No deals. I want that son of a bitch dead.
AID00118489	Kill him?  Can't we just cut a deal or something?
AID00118490	[Attack] Lucky you. You can borrow my dentures when I knock all your teeth out.
AID00118491	It'll take more than that to get me to talk, worm.
AID00118492	[Attack] Then you won't mind if I keep going.
AID00118493	Oh, but I do, Silus. Unlike you, I follow Caesar's orders.
AID00118494	[SUCCEEDED] I've done everything Caesar ever asked of me, and this is how I am repaid? With assassination?
AID00118495	I ambushed countless NCR patrols and wiped them out so that our operatives could move freely.
AID00118496	I waited for him to dispatch us for three days, never questioning why the "headaches" he complained of would hinder his ability to command.
AID00118497	Did you honestly believe you could escape death?
AID00118498	[?] If I had killed myself then I would've been murdering one of Caesar's greatest soldiers. Either choice is a betrayal of the Legion, as I see it.
AID00118499	You shouldn't have done that. I'm the only friend you have right now.
AID00118500	[?] You've made your intentions clear. The Legion has abandoned me.
AID00118501	I'll be right back.
AID00118502	Take your time.
AID00118503	But I want to know how a coward can attain the rank of centurion.
AID00118504	[?] Coward? I've faced odds that would make your NCR soldiers wet themselves.
AID00118505	I've led charges against men with guns carrying only my knife, and I can tell you, it was they who feared me.
AID00118506	But suicide is a weak death on a battlefield. It says to your enemy that you fear capture. It says if you're caught you can be broken.
AID00118507	You sure talk tough for someone who's afraid to die.
AID00118508	[?] You think I could get where I was in the Legion army if I feared death?
AID00118509	[Speech] You must've really screwed up to be caught by the NCR.
AID00118510	So in addition to treason, you're also a deserter.
AID00118511	[SUCCEEDED] No! That's not what I meant! I-
AID00118512	Lieutenant! This man is trying to kill me! He's not who you think he is!
AID00118513	[SUCCEEDED] No! That's not what I meant! I-
AID00118514	Lieutenant! This woman is trying to kill me! She's not who you think she is!
AID00118515	Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
AID00118516	[?] You have to let this go. I'll disappear. No one will ever see me again. That was always the plan in the first place.
AID00118517	You're a danger to him alive. Your knowledge threatens him.
AID00118518	[?] I've told them nothing. They've gotten nowhere. I'm a centurion, for Christ's sake. I deserve his trust.
AID00118519	[Speech] Yes. I want to *know* how such a big talker got caught so easily.
AID00118520	[Speech] Sounds to me like you were too gutless to follow Caesar's orders.
AID00118521	[SUCCEEDED] I'll show you gutless, you sniveling bastard. I'll spill your guts all over this room!
AID00118522	[Speech] You must miss giving orders, now that all your men are dead.
AID00118523	[?] Foot soldiers of the Legion are trained to not have to think for themselves - to have conflict removed from their minds.
AID00118524	They kill themselves to evade capture because they are not trusted to make such a decision rationally in the heat of battle.
AID00118525	But I'm no foot soldier. I knew I could escape captivity on my own, without revealing the tiniest iota of information to my captors.
AID00118526	Go over that one more time.
AID00118527	Very well.
AID00118528	I don't know why I'm taking this chance on an invalid... I'll explain again.
AID00118529	I understand.
AID00118530	Good. But for her to trust you to re-enter the room, she'll need to believe you've been doing what she expects of you.
AID00118531	You'll need to punch me until I'm bleeding and weak. Go on. This is nothing compared to the Legion's training.
AID00118532	How many agents of the Legion *are* there here?
AID00118533	I know of only the one other. Though I wouldn't be surprised if there were a great many.
AID00118534	I work independently.
AID00118535	Hmm... perhaps not, then.
AID00118536	What?
AID00118537	You were warned! Time to die.
AID00118538	I'm not a Khan. I'm just dressed like one.
AID00118539	Then what the fuck are you doing here? You looking to get killed? What the fuck?
AID00118540	Are there many water merchants around here?
AID00118541	There's a few independent ones like me, but it's mostly the big trading outfits that deal in water, like the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00118542	<Lie> Yes, Keely's fine. We escaped the Vault together.
AID00118543	[FAILED] No. That can't be right. Keely would've called in.
AID00118544	Maybe you think you helped her... I don't know. But I need to hear from Keely. Personally.
AID00118545	Otherwise... no reward. Not a cap.
AID00118546	Goodbye.
AID00118547	Thanks again. Really. I owe you.
AID00118548	<Lie> Keely is safe. She's just finishing up some research in the vault.
AID00118549	[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern.
AID00118550	But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten.
AID00118551	Sorry. I shouldn't question your word. If you say Keely's safe, I owe you these caps.
AID00118552	I don't believe you. You're lying.
AID00118553	Then you're a fool. That man reports to Caesar on what I do here. The Legion isn't going to take me back.
AID00118554	My only hope is to escape and disappear. But if I escape and he reports it, they'll hunt me down as long as I live.
AID00118555	It'd serve me to report him as much as it'd serve you.
AID00118556	Who's the operative?
AID00118557	I don't know. I know he sends intelligence by radio in the middle of the night. Sometimes that intelligence would find its way to my century.
AID00118558	I think I've heard all I need to. You've been very helpful.
AID00118559	I hope the Legion burns your wretched body at the stake when they conquer this place.
AID00118560	Nothing I could tell you would do anything to stop that.
AID00118561	See? Don't you feel better now that you've divulged all those state secrets?
AID00118562	So you were unafraid to cut any throat but your own.
AID00118563	And if you can't go through with it, you look even weaker.
AID00118564	[SUCCEEDED] You think I'm going to slit my throat for some megalomaniacal self-appointed dictator?
AID00118565	I didn't work my way up to have it all be taken from me out of some irrational paranoia. Caesar's losing it. I believe that.
AID00118566	He's been shutting himself in his tent. Privately, he complains of headaches. Whatever it is, it's affecting his ability to lead.
AID00118567	You've been tricked, Silus. I'm working with the NCR. I just got you to talk.
AID00118568	No! You slimy bastard!
AID00118569	No! You cursed bitch!
AID00118570	Nothing I've said will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion. This camp and everyone in it will burn.
AID00118571	[Attack] If you've got any last words, you'd better say them now, Legion scum.
AID00118572	Cedo nulli.
AID00118573	Your loyalty is commendable, but I don't work for Caesar's Legion.
AID00118574	If his empire falls, it'll probably be because his centurions are so gullible.
AID00118575	What? What do you mean?
AID00118576	I can deliver them your cold, dead skull.
AID00118577	I could just tell them you are dead. For a price.
AID00118578	Well now, I guess that depends on who's paying.
AID00118579	I was thinking we could make an arrangement.
AID00118580	What kind of arrangement did you have in mind?
AID00118581	Let's talk about something else.
AID00118582	I'm not here to talk. I'm here for business. Either do some or get the fuck out.
AID00118583	I'll give you exclusive rights to my personal stash, for a slight markup.
AID00118584	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, 22 caps each, but that's it.
AID00118585	[FAILED] These are my prices. I don't negotiate.
AID00118586	I don't suppose you can pay a little better?
AID00118587	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 20 caps.
AID00118588	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118589	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 22 caps.
AID00118590	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118591	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 20 caps.
AID00118592	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118593	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 22 caps.
AID00118594	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118595	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 20 caps.
AID00118596	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118597	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 22 caps.
AID00118598	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118599	Appearances can be deceiving. Shall we?
AID00118600	Cool. I haven't had a good fight in a while, and it's been ages since Donnie and Marie had something they could sink their teeth into!
AID00118601	Sounds good to me, and to the dogs, too! Dinnertime, boys!
AID00118602	I was actually just leaving.
AID00118603	Then get the fuck out. I'm a busy man.
AID00118604	The NCR sent me here to take care of you.
AID00118605	You? Take care of me? Ha! You don't look half-tough enough.
AID00118606	I'll be leaving now.
AID00118607	Nice doing business with you.
AID00118608	I'm just here looking around.
AID00118609	[FAILED] Then I think you'd better find your way out before you get yourself hurt.
AID00118610	[SUCCEEDED] I guess it isn't a secret. Yeah, the residents of the Vault are all dead. We killed them.
AID00118611	Funny thing is, they just let us in. We didn't have to force the doors or anything.
AID00118612	Can you tell me what happened to the residents here?
AID00118613	I have some chems that I can sell.
AID00118614	I'm paying 20 caps each for Jet, Psycho, or Buffout.
AID00118615	Deal is still the same, 20 caps each for jet, psycho, or buffout.
AID00118616	I'm here to do some business with chems.
AID00118617	Okay, our deal was Jet, Psycho, or Buffout for 22 caps a pop.
AID00118618	You want to buy some chems from my personal stash?
AID00118619	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00118620	All right, then.
AID00118621	Is there any place to buy weapons and armor?
AID00118622	I think there a few places, but I've heard that the Gun Runners sell the best.
AID00118623	Where can I find a doctor around here?
AID00118624	Doctor Usanagi runs a medical clinic up the road.
AID00118625	May I ask you some questions?
AID00118626	Sure. Fire away.
AID00118627	No, not yet.
AID00118628	Hurry!
AID00118629	Yes, I have it here.
AID00118630	Good! Give it to me.
AID00118631	I'm going to pretend to be unconscious. Let them send you out so no one suspects you.
AID00118632	When I'm alone with a guard, I'll shoot him and leave in his uniform.
AID00118633	There must be more you can tell me.
AID00118634	There is one other thing that may interest you. I know that Caesar has planted a spy here.
AID00118635	Every night details of NCR troop movements are broadcast from a radio on this base to Caesar's camp.
AID00118636	The spy has been here a long time - since before the entire conflict began. He's an officer.
AID00118637	If I knew who he was, I would tell you. If I escape and he's alive to report it, the Legion would hunt me down.
AID00118638	But like I said, none of this information will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion.
AID00118639	Maybe I'll beat some more useful information out of you.
AID00118640	Beat me all you like, but it won't make my information any more useful. You can take what I have or leave it.
AID00118641	I'll be the judge of that. Let's hear what you've got to say.
AID00118642	Something is wrong with Caesar. Something he is attempting to hide from his men. But it was obvious before we set out on this last mission.
AID00118643	For three days, we awaited his order to dispatch us. Three days. But he hid in his tent, refusing to give orders. Complaining of headaches.
AID00118644	He looks different now than he used to. His face is sunken, sickly. But any questioning of his health enrages him.
AID00118645	Crandon says you're not allowed to stay here. You'll have to go somewhere else.
AID00118646	Oh really? And how are you gonna make us?
AID00118647	<Attack> Easy, I'm just going to kill you.
AID00118648	Fuck you, asshole! You're gonna regret it!
AID00118649	I'm asking nicely. I only do that *once.*
AID00118650	[SUCCEEDED] H-Hey... hey, don't worry, I was just kidding. We're going, right boys?
AID00118651	[FAILED] I ain't moving my stuff just 'cause you ask, nicely or not. Get the fuck out of my sight, punk.
AID00118652	I'm asking nicely. Maybe you should go before I get angry at you.
AID00118653	I'd rather not have any trouble. Here's 50 caps, just keep yourself off the streets.
AID00118654	[SUCCEEDED] Sure. You got a deal.
AID00118655	[FAILED] That don't buy much these days. Double it and you've got a deal.
AID00118656	I've got other things in mind, right now.
AID00118657	Okay, I'll go see her.
AID00118658	I like your enthusiasm, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
AID00118659	I've got other things in mind, right now.
AID00118660	I'll deal with them.
AID00118661	Glad to hear it. Let me know when they're gone.
AID00118662	I've got other things in mind, right now.
AID00118663	Mercs with a brain are no good to me, stranger. Let me know when you start behaving like a real gun.
AID00118664	I'm on it.
AID00118665	I like your speed, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
AID00118666	Got any more work for me?
AID00118667	Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
AID00118668	There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
AID00118669	Anything else you'd like me to do?
AID00118670	You know, this time I may actually need a gun with a brain.
AID00118671	Talk to Mrs. Hostetler. She's near the Crimson Caravan. I think her daughter's making bad "friends," the kind that'll slit your throat in the dark.
AID00118672	What would you like me to do?
AID00118673	Some squatters decided to take space where they don't belong, over by the playground. We'd prefer to keep 'em off the streets and out of sight.
AID00118674	Maybe you could go and talk to them... convince them to see things our way.
AID00118675	Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
AID00118676	There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
AID00118677	Sorry for your loss. I hope the Colonel reconsiders.
AID00118678	So do I. But I know he won't. Ain't important enough in the scheme of things, you know? Still... thanks for listening.
AID00118679	I'll recover your husband's body.
AID00118680	Mister, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
AID00118681	Ma'am, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
AID00118682	Esteban's body is laid out between some buildings, east of the REPCONN headquarters. At least, that's what his squadmates said.
AID00118683	There's an NCR position just north of there. It's on the way. They should be able to tell you what the situation is.
AID00118684	How did he die?
AID00118685	He was out on patrol. Bunch of drugged-up Fiends attacked them.
AID00118686	Esteban laid down cover fire while the others fell back. One of the men saw him get shot. He didn't die, though, not then.
AID00118687	They tried to go back for him, but there were too many Fiends, and they had to pull out. Damn savages chased them halfway to McCarran.
AID00118688	I brought his body to an NCR position. He's on his way back to McCarran.
AID00118689	They put him in a box? With a flag and all? I hope so. He'd have been proud.
AID00118690	You're too good for this rotten town. First kind thing anybody ever did for me and Esteban.
AID00118691	You ever need anything, all you need to do is ask. Thank you so much.
AID00118692	You did what you said you would, and I owe you. Just like I promised, this is Esteban's back pay. Every cap.
AID00118693	Maybe the caps are all that matter to you, but... you still did more for Esteban than his own country did. Thank you.
AID00118694	I haven't found him yet.
AID00118695	No... I didn't expect nothing so soon. You're doing me a favor - I don't mean to be a pest.
AID00118696	You said you wanted the caps. If you're thinking I'm not good for the money... please, you've got to take my word.
AID00118697	It seems strange the NCR wouldn't do their best to retrieve a fallen comrade.
AID00118698	Colonel says he can't spare the men to bring Esteban back home. And the Fiends, they put all kinds of mines and traps around his body. Snipers, too.
AID00118699	If your husband is dead, what does it matter if you get the corpse back?
AID00118700	You never lost anybody, have you? Not like this. Never had to think about that person you love all alone out there, cooking in the sun like meat...
AID00118701	NCR never leaves a soldier behind. That's what the recruiters told us. Promised us. We believed them.
AID00118702	You look upset.  What's wrong?
AID00118703	I know... I've been crying. Stupid. I'm supposed to be a soldier.
AID00118704	My husband... he's a Ranger, and he... he got murdered by a pack of Fiends. Goddamn savages laid his body out to rot.
AID00118705	The brass won't say it to me straight, but they mean to leave Esteban out there. I can see that plain.
AID00118706	Some other guy replaced Price, and he definitely didn't know the password.
AID00118707	Ah shit, I'm guessing he got caught by the NCR. You need to kill that guy now that he's seen you.
AID00118708	Last thing we need is some investigator tracking you down. Get it done, and I think we can settle accounts, so to speak.
AID00118709	<Draw Weapon> Special delivery!
AID00118710	Ah, hell!
AID00118711	<Draw Weapon> Nothing now. I think I'll end your little investigation here.
AID00118712	<Draw Weapon> And now I'm going to kill you, you lying son of a bitch.
AID00118713	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, buddy...
AID00118714	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, honey...
AID00118715	Son of a...  Sir, I didn't know anything about this.
AID00118716	You know what? I believe you.
AID00118717	You're free to go. Contreras, however, won't be moving drugs ever again.
AID00118718	I'd like to buy some supplies.
AID00118719	The brass are pissed about the trouble you've been causing. Your caps are no good here.
AID00118720	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
AID00118721	Hey, I heard you were able to recover Morales' corpse.  In thanks, you get a discount on supplies.
AID00118722	That was a real honorable thing you done there, kid.  Much appreciated.
AID00118723	Here is what is currently available.
AID00118724	With your reputation? Well, I won't say your caps are no good here... let's just say that they're... less good.
AID00118725	VFreeformMcCarranCorpseGuard2
AID00118726	VFreeformMcCarranCorpseGuard1
AID00118727	Come on, you can tell me.
AID00118728	[FAILED] Not my place to talk. Sorry.
AID00118729	Anything you tell me stays with me.
AID00118730	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Some of the farmers, especially Trent Bascom, claim the NCR isn't giving them the water they need to meet their crop quotas.
AID00118731	Personally, I think they're just incompetent and making excuses. The NCR ought to send them all crying back to California.
AID00118732	Who's ungrateful?
AID00118733	I shouldn't have brought it up. It's not my place to spread gossip.
AID00118734	Tell me about the farms.
AID00118735	It's NCR-owned farmland. It produces a lot of the crops that supply McCarran and the Dam. The farmers are all civilians, though.
AID00118736	They work the farms, and in return they get a safe place to stay and clean food and water. Some of 'em aren't all that grateful, though.
AID00118737	What do you do around here?
AID00118738	I'm a private in the NCR army, and I've been proudly serving for two years now.
AID00118739	Although, if you were asking what I'm doing right this instant, I'm patrolling the farms. It's a safe post, but a little boring.
AID00118740	I do get to take shots at marauding Molerats once in awhile, and that's always fun.
AID00118741	Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
AID00118742	I do get to take shots at Molerats once in awhile, so that's always fun.
AID00118743	I'm looking to buy and sell things.
AID00118744	The Crimson Caravan Company is north of here. They have just about everything you need.
AID00118745	But, if you're in the market for guns, go see the Gun Runners. They're expensive, but they have stuff no one else carries.
AID00118746	I need a doctor.
AID00118747	There's the medic at Camp McCarran, but I've also heard there's a civilian doctor in the northeast part of New Vegas. I don't know for sure.
AID00118748	I could use some directions.
AID00118749	I'll help you if I can. What are you looking for?
AID00118750	Goodbye.
AID00118751	Bye.
AID00118752	If the Fiends are so dangerous, why hasn't the NCR wiped them out?
AID00118753	Current orders are to hold the line and nothing more. That's all we seem to do these days - hold the line.
AID00118754	I guess it's a tricky situation since there's a vault in Fiend territory. If the NCR went after them, they'd just hole up.
AID00118755	Are there more dangerous posts?
AID00118756	Oh, you'd better believe it. I feel sorry for the troops who are charged with keeping the Fiends from overrunning everything.
AID00118757	The Fiends are scary because they're unpredictable. One day, they'll be taking potshots at you and then running off before you can shoot back.
AID00118758	And the next day, they'll come rushing at you pumped full of drugs and not stopping until you or they are dead.
AID00118759	Ok, 200 is a deal.
AID00118760	Alright then, take my helmet and bring it to the NCR. That should be proof enough. This doesn't make us friends though.
AID00118761	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AID00118762	Actually, I can just bring them your head for free.
AID00118763	I was thinking closer to 150.
AID00118764	Sorry, no deal.
AID00118765	Okay, I don't need the money that bad. 150 it is. This doesn't make us friends though.
AID00118766	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AID00118767	The NCR is leaving you alone, 150 seems like a small price to pay.
AID00118768	You should pay me, I'm providing you the service.
AID00118769	I'm not going to pay you squat. Now get outta my face.
AID00118770	Yeah, that sounds like an alright deal. Here take my helmet back to the NCR. This doesn't make us friends though.
AID00118771	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AID00118772	How about you give me 75 caps, it'll keep the hit squads away for a bit.
AID00118773	I'll pay you, I'm sure I can make up the difference from NCR.
AID00118774	Okay, we got a deal. Now let's talk a price, it'll cost you 200 caps for proof of my death.
AID00118775	Nevermind, I'll just show myself out.
AID00118776	Nothing left to sell, time for me to leave.
AID00118777	Thanks for doing business.
AID00118778	That is all I can spare.
AID00118779	Okay then. What's your business now?
AID00118780	I'll sell you all my Buffout for 20 caps each.
AID00118781	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118782	I'll sell you all of my Buffout for 22 caps each.
AID00118783	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118784	I'll sell you all my Psycho for 20 caps each.
AID00118785	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118786	I'll sell you all of my Psycho for 22 caps each.
AID00118787	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118788	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 20 caps each.
AID00118789	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118790	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 22 caps each.
AID00118791	Okay, got anything else?
AID00118792	[Attack] Then I may as well beat you to death for personal satisfaction.
AID00118793	Let's see you try.
AID00118794	Fine. Tell me what you know.
AID00118795	You're out of your mind.
AID00118796	I'd love to debate you on this, but there's no time. Now do it or don't, but stop wasting my time.
AID00118797	Sounds dangerous, but I'll do it.
AID00118798	Good. Return to me when it's done.
AID00118799	I told you. I'm not helping you.
AID00118800	I don't think you understand the situation. Listen up.
AID00118801	This place is now locked down under quarantine, so neither of us is leaving until the situation at hand is dealt with.
AID00118802	The hell I am. The door to the entrance is locked!
AID00118803	Of course it is. This place is under quarantine until I finish what I started. Now listen up.
AID00118804	Just as long as I'm getting paid for this.
AID00118805	You really have a one track mind, you know that? Anyway, listen up.
AID00118806	Sure, how can I help?
AID00118807	Time is of the essence, so I'll be brief. This place is filled with spores that are toxic to humans, and we need to get rid of them.
AID00118808	I've pumped the vault full of a highly flammable gas that, once ignited, should destroy the vast majority of the spores. There's one problem, though.
AID00118809	The gas becomes semi-inert on exposure to oxygen, meaning the gas will have to be ignited close to where it's being introduced.
AID00118810	I need you to find the vents where the gas is being pumped and ignite it. Oh, and survive the resulting blast.
AID00118811	No deal. You'll have to do it without me.
AID00118812	Have it your way. When you change your mind, I'll be on the second level. Meet me there and I'll explain what needs to be done.
AID00118813	How much are you paying?
AID00118814	So you're one of those, huh? Fine, I'll give you all the money I have once we're done. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain more.
AID00118815	Of course. I'd be glad to help.
AID00118816	Good. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain what needs to be done.
AID00118817	I was sent to fetch some research data. No one said anything about a rescue.
AID00118818	Looks like you got sent on the same fool's errand I did, then.
AID00118819	No, I was just exploring the vault when I stumbled on this place.
AID00118820	Well that's a hell of a bit of luck on my part, then.
AID00118821	We can talk later. Right now we need to get out of here.
AID00118822	All right, all right. Just trying to make a little conversation. Shoulda known a youngin like you would be in a hurry.
AID00118823	But that's neither here nor there. These plants have gotten completely out of control. I've got a plan to deal with them, but I'll need your help.
AID00118824	<Give 100 caps> 200 seems a bit steep.  How about 100?
AID00118825	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain, but 100 caps will do until we can get a regular deal worked out with McCarran.
AID00118826	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
AID00118827	<Give 200 caps> Alright.  200 caps it is.
AID00118828	Great. I'll just pick up future payments from McCarran directly when I drop off my snacks.
AID00118829	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
AID00118830	I'll do it.
AID00118831	Great. Let me know what he says. They're almost a straight shot north from here, up past the sharecroppers.
AID00118832	Maybe later.
AID00118833	All right, well just find me when you want to get started.
AID00118834	You said you have some legwork needing done?
AID00118835	Well, I can't exactly go wandering off the base whenever I want, you know? They're already suspicious.
AID00118836	I can hear the MP's now. "Gee, Contreras, I didn't know you had so many friends in the Gun Runners." Speaking of which, guess your first stop.
AID00118837	You're just passing a little note to a man named Isaac for me. I want to know which girl he likes.
AID00118838	McCarran's mess hall needs more variety.  Could we work out a deal?
AID00118839	Well, business is pretty light and I'd welcome the income, but I'll need a lot of caps to buy the necessary supplies.
AID00118840	200 caps would get me started.
AID00118841	Can anything be done to improve your supplies?
AID00118842	Well, we haven't had any quality meat in months. Everyone in the camp just eating beans for protein... It isn't pretty.
AID00118843	Some of my kitchen machinery is broken down, too, so we've been eating mostly raw vegetables.
AID00118844	And I'm desperate for spices or seasonings. Anything. Just something to the general mood around here.
AID00118845	I can bring his body back, but it'll cost you.
AID00118846	Caps. This whole rotten town wants caps. Nobody does anything just because it's right.
AID00118847	Fine. You want caps? You can have all of Esteban's back pay. NCR owes me, and I don't even want the damn money.
AID00118848	I'd like to buy some food.
AID00118849	Chow down.
AID00118850	Sorry, but the brass ordered me to not serve enemies of NCR.
AID00118851	I don't like your kind taking food from my men, so I'm going to charge you a little extra. Don't like it? Tough.
AID00118852	Got anything to eat?
AID00118853	Oh yeah. You can order up anything you want... as long as it's corn or beans!<Laughs>
AID00118854	Just kidding. Haven't you heard? With few shipments from home and little variety, the troops are getting restless for some quality grub.
AID00118855	You can only do so much as a chef with just corn, beans, onions, and peppers.
AID00118856	Goodbye.
AID00118857	Then you're not from the colonel's office? Sorry... I shouldn't have bothered you.
AID00118858	Changed his mind about what?
AID00118859	Sorry, I don't have time to help you out.
AID00118860	We are going to die in here. Please, if you find the key let us out. We'll find our own way to safety.
AID00118861	Can you tell me about the Fiends?
AID00118862	They are a bunch of junkies that do whatever they can to get money for chems.
AID00118863	I hear they are lead by a guy calling himself Motor-Runner. I think he is in one of the other wings, although I haven't seen him myself.
AID00118864	I need to know a little more about Vault 3.
AID00118865	I don't know much, only that the people who lived in here originally were killed by the Fiends. Carter there escaped and managed to explore for a bit.
AID00118866	He hacked a password off of the computer, and found the location of some guns. He was on his way to get them when the Fiends caught him again.
AID00118867	Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
AID00118868	Thanks partner. I think the Fiend with the key is back in one of the bedrooms somewhere, someone called him Daniel. If that helps.
AID00118869	What are you doing here?
AID00118870	We were part of a caravan heading into New Vegas from down south. They are holding us hostage, trying to get some ransom.
AID00118871	Anyone willing to pay for us died in the attack. Once the Fiends figure that out, we are as good as dead.
AID00118872	Can you set us free now?
AID00118873	SquatterResult
AID00118874	That's good to hear. Can't ever be too careful with strangers around here.
AID00118875	I've dealt with those newcomers.
AID00118876	I'm starting to think you're as undesirable around here as those strangers. Do something to change my mind, merc.
AID00118877	Not yet. I'll get on it.
AID00118878	That's good to hear. Can't ever keep too many eyes on strangers around here.
AID00118879	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
AID00118880	I've dealt with those newcomers.
AID00118881	FiendResult
AID00118882	I thought you'd be made of stronger stuff, merc. Don't prove me wrong or I'll have to find someone else with the guts to do what's right.
AID00118883	I haven't sent them to the sewers, yet.
AID00118884	Great work. I gotta make sure this place doesn't eat itself from the inside.
AID00118885	I've taken care of those troublemakers.
AID00118886	Great work. I gotta make sure this place doesn't eat itself from the inside.
AID00118887	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
AID00118888	I've taken care of those troublemakers.
AID00118889	I don't have that much.
AID00118890	A hundred caps? Forget it.
AID00118891	Then we ain't going nowhere.
AID00118892	Fine, take it.
AID00118893	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00118894	Give me the directions again.
AID00118895	Not my problem. Goodbye.
AID00118896	Not your problem. Right. That's the motto in this town. Rotten people, rotten place.
AID00118897	McCarran has more vegetables and water than they know what to do with...
AID00118898	[SUCCEEDED] Fresh food and water is worth it's weight in gold... You've got yourself a deal.
AID00118899	Let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days. I'll pick up the produce at that time as well.
AID00118900	Maybe we could work something out later.
AID00118901	Suit yourself.  I'm always open to more business.
AID00118902	The scientists here must have made some useful discoveries.
AID00118903	Oh, they did. I've taken extensive notes of all their successful experiments. Their research won't go to waste. As for the file erasure...
AID00118904	Never mind. Go ahead and delete the files.
AID00118905	You're pretty highstrung for a youngster. In any case, just a few more moments and...
AID00118906	<Lie> No, I've been too busy rescuing you. Could someone else have done it?
AID00118907	It's possible. I have spent the last few days in a cave, after all.
AID00118908	For all we know, that man sent someone immediately after you to swipe the data while you posed as mantis bait.
AID00118909	Nothing to be done about it, I suppose. All we can do is delete what's here, and that's done.
AID00118910	Good riddance. Those files have caused enough trouble.
AID00118911	Indeed. This should only take a minute. Just a few more moments and...
AID00118912	On second thought, go ahead and erase the data.
AID00118913	Glad you're thinking clearly. I was afraid to blink there for a second.
AID00118914	There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
AID00118915	Positive.
AID00118916	Then you give me no choice.
AID00118917	I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
AID00118918	So you're going to be stubborn about it, eh? You're sure I can't change your mind about this?
AID00118919	Actually, I copied the files. Hildern sent me here to get them.
AID00118920	Yes, that sounds like something he'd do. Well, there's nothing for it, then.
AID00118921	Those files need to be erased. Hold out your arm and I'll have it done in a flash.
AID00118922	Will it take long?
AID00118923	No, it shouldn't take all that long. Just a few more moments and...
AID00118924	...it's done. We can rest easy.
AID00118925	...that's strange. The system says that the files were accessed recently, and copied to an external source.
AID00118926	You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
AID00118927	I've unlocked the door so you're free to run along now. Although it pains me to say it, I wouldn't have made it out of here without your help.
AID00118928	If you're heading back toward McCarran, tell Dr. Williams that she has my thanks as well.
AID00118929	If you're in the neighborhood of Camp McCarran anytime soon, look for a Dr. Williams. She was one of the few people there I could tolerate.
AID00118930	She seemed genuinely worried when I agreed to come out here, so if you could be a dear and let her know I'm okay, I'd be most grateful.
AID00118931	Exactly. Without that knowledge, something similar is bound to occur.
AID00118932	All right. You convinced me. Take the files back to that buffoon. You make a good point, but I still honestly hope you know what you're doing.
AID00118933	Science isn't just about success. Failures are just as important to learn from.
AID00118934	I suppose the data here could serve as a warning to other scientists. Tell them what paths of research not to follow.
AID00118935	
AID00118936	How do you figure that?
AID00118937	Deleting those files makes it more likely that this will happen again.
AID00118938	If we destroy the files, all of these people will have died in vain.
AID00118939	No, these people died trying to stop a monster of their own creation. Failing to complete their work would mean they died in vain.
AID00118940	And that's what I intend to do. And...
AID00118941	I need those files. Dr. Hildern specifically sent me here to find them.
AID00118942	Don't you realize what those files represent? If they get into the wrong hands, this could happen all over again.
AID00118943	Only this time, the madness won't just be confined to a musty vault. Do you really want that on your conscience? I sure as hell don't.
AID00118944	Wait! Don't delete the files!
AID00118945	What's got you so flustered? You just about scared me to death shouting like that.
AID00118946	What needs to be done?
AID00118947	I've managed to create a connection to the vault's backup system from here. I just have to remotely delete all the files, and we're done here.
AID00118948	Any idea where these vents are that I'm looking for?
AID00118949	I set the gas to pump into the fifth level since that's where the concentration of spores was highest. I'd start looking there.
AID00118950	Typically, these vaults use circular vents in their air circulation systems. Look for a wall with two of them almost side by side.
AID00118951	There's one just around the corner outside this lab if you need an example.
AID00118952	Know where I can find a doctor?
AID00118953	I'm pretty sure they've got a doc over at Camp McCarran, but I don't know if he'll treat just anybody.
AID00118954	Who sells equipment around here?
AID00118955	The Crimson Caravan Company's the big dog around here. Keep following the road north and you'll eventually come across their camp.
AID00118956	That's all I want to know right now.
AID00118957	All right.
AID00118958	I have some general questions for you.
AID00118959	Shoot.
AID00118960	What do you know about the NCR?
AID00118961	Their main base is right over there by the old airport - it's called Camp McCarran now. Some people like to paint 'em all as a bunch of bullies.
AID00118962	Me, I'm glad they're around. They do what they can to keep things safe and orderly.
AID00118963	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00118964	They're a bunch of crazies hopped up on all kind of drugs. Apparently, they're using one of the old vaults as a hideout.
AID00118965	The army should really get in there and wipe 'em all out, but I guess they've got more than enough trouble to deal with right now.
AID00118966	Anything I should know about New Vegas?
AID00118967	They won't just let anybody into the Strip, but you should be able to have a good time in Freeside itself. Just, uh, keep a close eye on your caps.
AID00118968	No, should they have?
AID00118969	Well, if they had any manners they would. In my day, if an old lady went missing for a spell, people cared.
AID00118970	Hsu is dead.
AID00118971	What? You idiot! I spent years earning his trust. The whole point of your heading up this operation was to preserve that trust!
AID00118972	Now they'll replace him in a week with some other colonel and I'll be back to square one. You've set me back years today. Years!
AID00118973	Get the hell out of my sight.
AID00118974	Hsu bought it. You should be in the clear.
AID00118975	Perfect. This has turned out better than I'd ever imagined.
AID00118976	This will pay dividends for the Legion for a long time to come. I was with Hsu when the bomb went off. He'll never think to investigate me for it.
AID00118977	I'll make sure Caesar himself hears about your success today. And take this, courtesy of the NCR. I'm sure they won't miss it.
AID00118978	Who should I be talking to about the intelligence leaks again?
AID00118979	Well, I'll leave that to you. But I would recommend Lieutenant Boyd and Sergeant Contreras as two people who usually know what's going on around here.
AID00118980	I don't. I was just trying to get myself out of trouble.
AID00118981	I can't let you leave.
AID00118982	I heard someone's been breaking in here at night. Looks like it's you.
AID00118983	I'm positive.
AID00118984	Very well. Let me know if you should change your mind.
AID00118985	You're right. I'll help.
AID00118986	I'm not interested in helping you. You're on your own.
AID00118987	Are you sure? Because I think the Legion would frown upon that decision.
AID00118988	If you're going to blow it up, what do you need my help for?
AID00118989	Could you go over that again?
AID00118990	Yeah, let's make sure you have it down pat.
AID00118991	Understood. I'll go and pick up the explosives.
AID00118992	Good. Try to plant the explosives quietly if you can - you'll make both our lives easier.
AID00118993	But first things first. Go offer your services to Colonel Hsu. Tell him you'll work independently to find the leak.
AID00118994	He's running out of options. He'll accept as long as you don't give him a reason not to.
AID00118995	If he doesn't, then don't be surprised if you're the new scapegoat. So don't fuck this up.
AID00118996	The scapegoat isn't me, is it?
AID00118997	No, no. I wouldn't do that. Not unless I didn't have better options, anyway. And I do.
AID00118998	Tell me what I need to do.
AID00118999	I have the explosives stashed in a trash can next to the ticketing counter along with some incriminating documents.
AID00119000	You'll pick them up and make your way upstairs to the monorail terminal.
AID00119001	They change the guard there at 0900 and 1800 hours. There'll be a small window where there's no one guarding the train.
AID00119002	And you have something in mind for me?
AID00119003	I told you I think they're starting to suspect me. You're going to help me cast away those suspicions.
AID00119004	You're going to put the bomb on that train.
AID00119005	I'll be sure to be in the presence of several reliable eyewitnesses when it happens. Then we're going to pin this on a scapegoat.
AID00119006	I'd planned on disappearing after this operation. It'd be a matter of time before they traced it to me. Figured out I was a frumentarius.
AID00119007	But with your help, maybe I can stay on after all. Make plans for something... grander.
AID00119008	What next part?
AID00119009	If you haven't noticed, the NCR bolsters its presence on the Strip from here. Sends troopers on the monorail in shifts.
AID00119010	The monorail lets them occupy two positions for the price of one. It's a supply line that's immune to raiders and other hindrances on the ground.
AID00119011	If someone were to cut that line, both positions would be much weaker. Fragile. They know this, and they watch it like hawks.
AID00119012	But I've been here a long time, and I've learned everything there is to know about it. And I'm going to blow up that train.
AID00119013	How many years have you been on this assignment?
AID00119014	Took me three-and-a-half years, just to make Captain. Usually takes four, but I made sure there was an early vacancy.
AID00119015	Caesar sees threats before they're even aware of him. He sent me long before we moved to occupy the eastern riverbank.
AID00119016	And now all my work, all the waiting, is about to pay off.
AID00119017	I have a lead. There's been someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
AID00119018	Is that right? No one has any business being in there after dusk. I wonder...
AID00119019	There's a lot of communications equipment up there. He could be using it to touch base with whoever sent him.
AID00119020	You've already done us a lot of good, but I'm afraid to move on this myself. We've tried catching this guy before and he can always smell a trap.
AID00119021	But he may not know about you. I need you to follow him into the tower. See if you can discover his identity. Report back and I'll have him arrested.
AID00119022	Report back when you've got it and I'll have him arrested.
AID00119023	It's done. The evidence is in Crenshaw's locker and Crenshaw is dead.
AID00119024	Poor Crenshaw. He's pulled his last prank.
AID00119025	Go and tell Colonel Hsu you found the bomber. Once Hsu's convinced, we can breathe easy.
AID00119026	Is there a bathroom in here?
AID00119027	You don't seem like you're supposed to be here, either.
AID00119028	Really? And how would you know where I'm supposed to be?
AID00119029	I have clearance for catching spies.
AID00119030	I don't know what you mean.
AID00119031	Goodbye.
AID00119032	Bye.
AID00119033	What do you do here?
AID00119034	Officially I'm in charge of Bravo Company. But since General Oliver has Bravo and most of our forces here garrisoned, I'm free to do other things.
AID00119035	So I work with Colonel Hsu on logistics. Patrols, supply lines, reinforcements, that sort of thing.
AID00119036	Hell of a position to be in when you're working for the other side. But I have to sabotage with a light touch, or else my guilt would be obvious.
AID00119037	Lately it's been less about that and more about figuring out how that information is getting leaked to raiders.
AID00119038	It's a big base with a lot of unhappy soldiers. They get stir-crazy. Hard to separate the malcontents from the actual culprit.
AID00119039	I know who you are. I'm working for the Legion, too.
AID00119040	Christ, keep it down! You want to blow the whole thing? We've worked years for this.
AID00119041	But maybe it's good you're here. Hsu knows about the leaks, and I'm supposed to find the spy for him.
AID00119042	At first I couldn't believe my luck. But since I haven't produced results - for obvious reasons - I feel him looking at me differently now.
AID00119043	Maybe he's just thinking about putting someone else in charge, maybe he's starting to suspect. Either way it's bad for me.
AID00119044	Especially once this next part goes down.
AID00119045	Colonel Hsu wanted me to help you look into the recent intelligence leaks.
AID00119046	Smart man. I could use somebody who can operate under the radar around here.
AID00119047	Whoever our mole is, he's been slippery. Whenever one of the MP's gets too close, he changes his habits. Our last lead went cold weeks ago.
AID00119048	I'm not interested in this right now.
AID00119049	Suit yourself.
AID00119050	You mentioned your husband works for the caravans?
AID00119051	Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long ours to provide for our daughter and me.
AID00119052	You should speak to him if you get the chance - he's always saying how badly understaffed they are.
AID00119053	Crandon said you might have a problem I could help with. Something delicate.
AID00119054	What parts are needed to fix the food processor?
AID00119055	Here is the list. We've been scrapping together quick-fixes to keep it running for months. I think it finally crapped out and needs a full overhaul.
AID00119056	It's the goofy machine behind the counter in the corner next to the stove. I'd be much obliged if you could take a look at it and get it fixed up.
AID00119057	Where might I find these parts?
AID00119058	I don't know. Try the various traders around the wastes, or the pawn shop in Westside might have some parts.
AID00119059	Oh, I've heard of a place called House Tools you could check out! Its an old factory on the north side of Vegas.
AID00119060	Just a word of warning, though. I hear no one who goes in there comes back out. Could be traps, crazy robots, or who knows what in that place.
AID00119061	Where should I look for spices?
AID00119062	The Crimson Caravan would probably be able to arrange a regular shipment, but I don't know of any spices known to improve mood.
AID00119063	Hell, we have a whole research department. One guy's even set up in the main terminal building. They're the ones who oughtta be looking into it.
AID00119064	Yes, Angela Williams asked me to come find you.
AID00119065	Ah, she's such a dear. Not like that pompous little pedant she works for.
AID00119066	Goodbye.
AID00119067	Sorry... I'm not fit for proper conversation, not now.
AID00119068	Goodbye.
AID00119069	If you find him... or if you hear any news... I'll be right here.
AID00119070	VMS08CurtisRadio11
AID00119071	Ten-four.
AID00119072	VMS08CurtisRadio10
AID00119073	Ten-four. Keep us updated.
AID00119074	VMS08CurtisRadio9
AID00119075	Couple of minutes. Over.
AID00119076	VMS08CurtisRadio8
AID00119077	How long?
AID00119078	VMS08CurtisRadio7
AID00119079	Charges are set. Detonation will occur as the train leaves the station. Over.
AID00119080	VMS08CurtisRadio6
AID00119081	What's the status of your primary mission, Picus?
AID00119082	VMS08CurtisRadio3.5
AID00119083	That would leave them the morning to bury mines along that stretch. Over.
AID00119084	VMS08CurtisRadio5
AID00119085	Roger Lupa.
AID00119086	VMS08CurtisRadio4
AID00119087	Ten-four, Picus. Fiends will be alerted.
AID00119088	VMS08CurtisRadio3
AID00119089	Afternoon patrol enters Fiend territory at 1300. Have them mine that stretch.
AID00119090	VMS08CurtisRadio02
AID00119091	Go ahead, Picus.
AID00119092	VMS08CurtisRadio1
AID00119093	Lupa, this is Frumentarius Picus, over.
AID00119094	I have another couple of questions for you.
AID00119095	Be quick about it.
AID00119096	Alright, I don't want to cause you any trouble.
AID00119097	See that you don't.
AID00119098	I can handle myself pretty well. I found you didn't I?
AID00119099	I guess you probably can. You look tough enough at least. I'm not sure how long it'll take this leg to heal up.
AID00119100	Sorry, no dice. I have a job to do, and it doesn't involve cleaning up after your mess.
AID00119101	Trust me. I can be quiet.
AID00119102	Wait here.
AID00119103	Okay, I'll wait.
AID00119104	Come on. It's time for us to go take care of Motor-Runner.
AID00119105	Roger that shit. Let's go.
AID00119106	Let's talk about something else.
AID00119107	Like what?
AID00119108	What was your mission again?
AID00119109	I was sent here to kill Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
AID00119110	The NCR hopes that killing Motor-Runner will slow down the Fiends raiding in the area, at least until a new leader comes around.
AID00119111	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
AID00119112	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves before they were all killed by the fiends.
AID00119113	What can you tell me about the Fiends?
AID00119114	They're a bunch of degenerate, drug-addicted killers and rapists who've turned the west side of Vegas into a war zone.
AID00119115	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner. He seems to be the only one who can still rub two brain cells together.
AID00119116	Just making sure you're okay. I'll be back.
AID00119117	Thanks for the concern, doc.
AID00119118	Roger that.
AID00119119	That's all for now, soldier.
AID00119120	<Lie> I think your leg's in good enough shape. You're all set.
AID00119121	Really? It doesn't feel any better... but I'll take your word on it. Motor-Runner, here I come.
AID00119122	I think you should head back to McCarran to have that leg looked at.
AID00119123	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
AID00119124	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AID00119125	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AID00119126	Crap, it looks like I may have lost it. I sure hope you have some way to get us through that door.
AID00119127	I just have a couple questions.
AID00119128	Okay, what do you need?
AID00119129	Why don't both of you get out of here? I'll make sure you have time to get away.
AID00119130	Okay, I'll do it.
AID00119131	I just have a couple questions.
AID00119132	Okay, what do you need?
AID00119133	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
AID00119134	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AID00119135	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AID00119136	Crap, it looks like I may have lost it. I sure hope you have some way to get us through that door.
AID00119137	I think you should head back to base to have that leg looked at.
AID00119138	<Lie> I think you are healthy enough to take care of Motor-Runner yourself.
AID00119139	Really? I didn't think my leg was up to full speed yet, but I'll take your word on it.
AID00119140	I'll go take care of Motor-Runner.
AID00119141	Not right now, just making sure you are ok. I'll be back later.
AID00119142	Okay, thanks again for the medical care doc.
AID00119143	Roger.
AID00119144	That's it for now soldier.
AID00119145	What can you tell me about the Fiends?
AID00119146	The Fiends are a bunch of raider junkie fucks who have been causing a lot of trouble in the area outside of Vegas.
AID00119147	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner, and he seems to be the only one with a brain that isn't fully burnt out on chems.
AID00119148	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
AID00119149	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves for a couple weeks.
AID00119150	Then they caught the Fiends attention. I don't think they set up any kind of security, stupid fucks. They all got themselves killed.
AID00119151	What was your mission again?
AID00119152	I was sent here to kill Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
AID00119153	The NCR hopes that killing Motor-Runner will slow down the Fiends raiding in the area, at least until a new leader comes around.
AID00119154	Let's talk about something else.
AID00119155	Okay, tell me what's on your mind.
AID00119156	Follow me, let's go take care of Motor-Runner.
AID00119157	Okay, let's get him.
AID00119158	Wait here.
AID00119159	Okay, I'll wait.
AID00119160	SPEECH attempt for Bryce to let you take out Motor Runner
AID00119161	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you have a point. And I don't know how long it'll be before I'm on both feet...
AID00119162	I can handle myself just fine. I found you, didn't I?
AID00119163	[FAILED] It's not a matter of toughness, it's a matter of smarts. You'll just make a mess of things.
AID00119164	But if you must get yourself killed, I heard a Fiend named Daniel saying he carries keys. Maybe he has a spare to the Maintenance Wing.
AID00119165	Trust me, I'm tougher than I look!
AID00119166	All right, fine. I don't want to cause you any trouble.
AID00119167	First sensible thing I've heard you say.
AID00119168	Let me ask you some questions.
AID00119169	Be quick about it.
AID00119170	VMS07PlaceholderGreeting
AID00119171	Never mind. No more bounties, for now.
AID00119172	Got any more open bounties?
AID00119173	Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
AID00119174	Already done. Here's the head.
AID00119175	Actually, I have another head here.
AID00119176	No. I've had enough.
AID00119177	Well... we're still better off than we were. Maybe one of my snipers will get lucky. If not, and you change your mind... you know where I'll be.
AID00119178	Never mind. No more bounties, for now.
AID00119179	Sorry to hear that. You had my hopes up. If you change your mind, the bounties still stand... unless somebody else claims them.
AID00119180	All right. I'll do it.
AID00119181	That's the best damn thing I've heard all day. Finally somebody around here with some goddamn ambition.
AID00119182	There's two psycho-bastards left. Which one will it be?
AID00119183	No, I've had enough for now.
AID00119184	Fair enough. You've done your part. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
AID00119185	All right. I'll go after Cook-cook.
AID00119186	All right. I'll go after Driver Nephi.
AID00119187	All right. I'll go after Violet.
AID00119188	I want to claim a bounty.
AID00119189	That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
AID00119190	You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
AID00119191	If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
AID00119192	Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
AID00119193	Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
AID00119194	Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
AID00119195	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
AID00119196	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
AID00119197	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
AID00119198	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
AID00119199	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
AID00119200	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
AID00119201	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
AID00119202	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
AID00119203	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
AID00119204	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
AID00119205	Yeah... that's Cook-cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
AID00119206	Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
AID00119207	This is Cook-cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
AID00119208	It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
AID00119209	Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
AID00119210	That's two psychopaths dead. If you can bring down the third, there's a bonus in it for you.
AID00119211	You've been one hell of a stroke of good luck, you know that? Those three scumbags probably killed twenty NCR troopers. And you bring them down alone.
AID00119212	Wish I had a few grunts as good as you. Damn good working with you.
AID00119213	Who is Little Buster?
AID00119214	Bounty hunter. Talks big. But he's still alive, so he can't be completely full of shit.
AID00119215	I think he's out in the yard, waiting to claim a couple bounties.
AID00119216	Where is Lt. Gorobets?
AID00119217	Out in the yard. Gorobets coordinates our sniper teams. He's been gunning for Nephi for weeks now.
AID00119218	Only thing he hasn't had is willing bait. Don't have enough troops to order anyone beyond the fence. Not anymore, anyway.
AID00119219	Anything else I need to know?
AID00119220	One more thing. If you want the full reward, you need to bring me a recognizable head. My superiors need proof they're gone.
AID00119221	That means no headshots. No decapitations 'til after they're dead. And no damage to the face. If you want to be safe, aim for the chest.
AID00119222	You bring me a head that looks like a rotten tomato, people will be doubting, and I won't be authorized to pay the entire bounty.
AID00119223	Good luck to you. And don't get careless.
AID00119224	You've gone after the Fiends before - I don't have to tell you to keep alert. Good luck.
AID00119225	Just bring me back that last head. And don't lose your own.
AID00119226	I've changed my mind. I want to choose a different bounty.
AID00119227	Makes no difference to me. I'd be happy to see any one of them dead. Who will it be?
AID00119228	Where can I find her?
AID00119229	Good question. Fiend territory is southeast of here, but they range all over the area. None of them stays in any one place for long.
AID00119230	None of them.
AID00119231	Can't say I blame you. If I wasn't in this fight for my country, you couldn't pay me enough to screw with those maniacs.
AID00119232	If you change your mind, I'll be happy to see you again. Otherwise... best to stay out of the way.
AID00119233	Cook-Cook.
AID00119234	One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal.
AID00119235	Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he can get his hands on.
AID00119236	Only one man's gotten close to killing him, and that's Little Buster. So he says, anyway. Maybe it's bullshit, but I'd still ask him about it.
AID00119237	Driver Nephi.
AID00119238	You've got some guts, I'll give you that. Nephi is one tough son of a bitch. You let him get close, and he'll take your head off.
AID00119239	My advice is this. Talk to Lieutenant Gorobets. He's in charge of Alpha Team, 1st Recon. Snipers.
AID00119240	If you're lucky, you can lure Nephi into the open, and the sharpshooters can bring him down. You bring me the head, you'll still get the bounty.
AID00119241	It's a better bet than trying to take Nephi one-on-one, but it's your call.
AID00119242	Violet.
AID00119243	Violet it is. Wish I could give you more advice on how to bring her down, but we know less about her than the other two.
AID00119244	Just watch out for the dogs. She raises them herself. Might as well be their mother - they never leave her side.
AID00119245	No. I don't think so.
AID00119246	Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Only one thing concerns me right now, and that's killing the bastards that are murdering my men.
AID00119247	You want to talk to somebody in charge, I'd start with Colonel Hsu and work my way down. You'll find him in the Main Concourse.
AID00119248	But if you want to take down some psycho-crazy bastards... I'm happy to talk caps.
AID00119249	Might be. Give me their names.
AID00119250	First one calls herself Violet. God knows why - the name is the prettiest thing about her. Spends most of her time with a pack of vicious dogs.
AID00119251	Then there's Driver Nephi. He's fast and he's brutal. Killed about a dozen of my men with a goddamn driver iron. Hence his name.
AID00119252	And finally... Cook-cook. Rapist. Pyromaniac. And damn good chef, if you believe the Fiends we've captured. Probably the craziest of the lot.
AID00119253	I'm not going to feed you any bullshit. These aren't your common Vegas trash. They've all killed good NCR men, and plenty of mercs, too.
AID00119254	You go after them - any of them - you're in for a hell of a fight. So... which one is it going to be?
AID00119255	Yes, it does.
AID00119256	Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
AID00119257	Goodbye.
AID00119258	Right.
AID00119259	You're having trouble with the Fiends?
AID00119260	Damn right I am. And I'm paying bounties.
AID00119261	What do you know about the Fiends?
AID00119262	Pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every stim, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up earth.
AID00119263	I've got three Fiends I want dead, and I don't give a goddamn how it gets done. That sound like something that interests you?
AID00119264	McCarran could work out a regular exchange of fresh vegetables and clean water.
AID00119265	Rations do get tight from time-to-time and it would be nice to keep a regular stock of goods.
AID00119266	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AID00119267	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AID00119268	They have an tons of vegetables and water.  How about expanding your business?
AID00119269	Expanding isn't a bad idea.  Maybe I could open up a small cafe restaurant with the more diverse inventory...
AID00119270	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AID00119271	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AID00119272	Corporal Farber said they can pay you the going market price in caps.
AID00119273	Hey, that sounds good to me.  No more wasted meat just laying around to rot.  I can keep my stock fresh and keep the caps flowing.
AID00119274	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AID00119275	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AID00119276	McCarran is looking for a regular delivery of meat from local merchants.
AID00119277	Really?  Well, I obviously couldn't supply enough to feed the entire camp, but I'm game.  What kind of caps are we talking here?
AID00119278	No one else will help you?
AID00119279	His best friend, Jackson, tried. Didn't even get permission from his CO, so it could have cost him a lot. But he never came back.
AID00119280	This spore pod extract from Keely should help with morale.
AID00119281	No shit? The stuff actually does all that, huh?
AID00119282	I'll have to start testing this out immediately. This will really help keep the guys focused.
AID00119283	I fixed the food processor.
AID00119284	Amazing. I thought that thing was done for. That'll help me transform what I can offer the troops.
AID00119285	I'll give you a little extra discount the next time you buy food from me. Thanks again.
AID00119286	I found a merchant named Fitz who agreed to sell meat to McCarran.
AID00119287	Good, that should help diversify things. It may be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
AID00119288	Great! What he sells might be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
AID00119289	Blake at the Crimson Caravan agreed to sell meat and spices.
AID00119290	Good to hear. That should cover the majority of the supply.
AID00119291	That should help balance out our stock of food more reasonably and save us a ton of caps. Good work!
AID00119292	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices for vegetables and water.
AID00119293	You managed to swing us a discount and cover the majority of the meat supply we need? Good work!
AID00119294	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices at a generous discount.
AID00119295	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade with McCarran.
AID00119296	Great! Small price to pay in caps for a little variety in our weekly menu.
AID00119297	Excellent! That'll save us some caps and help offload a bit of our overstock.
AID00119298	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade snacks for vegetables and water.
AID00119299	What can you tell me about Driver Nephi?
AID00119300	Not enough. We've been trying to put a bullet in him for a few weeks. He's strong as a brahmin bull, and he's fast.
AID00119301	Seems like he usually runs with a gang of Fiends. Uses them for cover. We haven't been able to get a clean shot at him.
AID00119302	Betsy swears she's hit him. Twice. But if she's right, it didn't seem to slow him down.
AID00119303	Is there any work to do here?
AID00119304	I've got proof of what I've said.
AID00119305	I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before we run you off the hard way.
AID00119306	Have time to tell me about any work you need done?
AID00119307	Alice's "friends" plan to use her to steal your Crimson Caravan earnings.
AID00119308	Nonsense! Alice's a good girl. She may be going through a hard time, but...
AID00119309	What the hell? It's none of your business. Don't bother me with this any longer.
AID00119310	What the hell? It's none of your business. Don't bother me with this any longer.
AID00119311	So, about Alice...
AID00119312	I've got to talk to you about Alice.
AID00119313	I really don't have time for this right now.
AID00119314	Is there any work to be had here?
AID00119315	You know, hiring isn't really my department. You should talk to Ms. McLafferty about work for hire.
AID00119316	Like I said, talk to Alice McLafferty, she's in charge here.
AID00119317	Who did you say I should ask about work?
AID00119318	Who are you?
AID00119319	The name's Hostetler - Don Hostetler. Can I help you with something?
AID00119320	I've already told you... I'm Don Hostetler.
AID00119321	Forget it. I don't like the odds.
AID00119322	Your call. Even if you were one of my troopers, I wouldn't force you to take a risk like that.
AID00119323	But the offer stands. Give me the word, and I'll put my snipers in position. Otherwise, they'll stay inside the fence.
AID00119324	I'll see what I can do. No promises, though.
AID00119325	All right. I'll do it.
AID00119326	Listen. My team has a debt to settle with Nephi. We've seen too many of our boys get brained by that golf club of his.
AID00119327	You lure him out for us, and if we can score some payback... we'll all pitch in caps for a reward.
AID00119328	My team will take up positions around the old rock crushing plant. They'll wait until they see Nephi, and then they'll start shooting.
AID00119329	At that point, just keep your head down, and stay out of range of his golf club. We'll take care of the rest.
AID00119330	I'd rather just bring your people with me.
AID00119331	No, I won't risk my team in the open. They're deadly at range, but they've got no advantage hand-to-hand.
AID00119332	But if you can draw him out... get us a clean shot... we can bring him down. No problem.
AID00119333	It's a lot to ask, I know. You'd be taking most of the risk.
AID00119334	Do you think that will work?
AID00119335	Can we hit him? Damn straight, we can. Question is whether he kills you before we get a clear shot.
AID00119336	Exactly. I'll be the bait.
AID00119337	It's one hell of a risk you'd be taking. But if you're willing... we'll do everything we can to keep you alive.
AID00119338	I need your help to kill him.
AID00119339	What did you have in mind? You thinking of luring him into range of my snipers?
AID00119340	How good is your squad?
AID00119341	I've been sniping since I was old enough to walk. Lot of us sharpshooters get recruited off the farms and ranches out west. Comes natural to us.
AID00119342	As for my squad - they're the best we have. My word on that. They're all hand-picked, and I won't work with anybody who isn't up to snuff.
AID00119343	10 of Spades is the greenest of the bunch, but he's a farmboy, like me. Shooting's in his blood.
AID00119344	I'm going to need your help.
AID00119345	You've got it.
AID00119346	Hsu won't trust me enough to let me investigate.
AID00119347	Yeah, you haven't exactly kept a low profile. That narrows our options somewhat. They're not gonna believe your accusations.
AID00119348	But you can still create an alibi for me. I could make sure people know I haven't been near the monorail all day while you're busy blowing it up.
AID00119349	It'd be better with a scapegoat, but it'll at least deflect some suspicion.
AID00119350	FiendCookCookGrief
AID00119351	No! Queenie! Hahahaha! I'm going to burn the world for you, Queenie!
AID00119352	Goodbye.
AID00119353	Later.
AID00119354	That sounds good to me.  What do you need done?
AID00119355	Where do you get all this meat?
AID00119356	Heh heh. Good meat, huh? Cat meat, rat meat, dog meat - maybe even *you* meat!
AID00119357	What exactly are you on?
AID00119358	Heh. Good shit. Psycho. Top quality. You want? Might know a guy who knows a guy.
AID00119359	What do you know about Driver Nephi and Cook-Cook?
AID00119360	Don't fuck with Fiends. Driver Nephi'll brain your skull in! Cook-Cook... don't even want to know what he'll do.
AID00119361	What's the deal with all the dogs?
AID00119362	Dogs? Good dogs! My dogs! Fiend dogs. Tear you up, arf arf arf! Ha ha!
AID00119363	Who are you?
AID00119364	Who wants to know? You here for my dogs? Can't have my dogs. Here for meat? Can't have my meat. Meat's for dogs.
AID00119365	I'm Violet. Dogs are mine. Meat is mine.
AID00119366	<Draw Weapon> Nevermind.  I think killing you will keep things simple.
AID00119367	Don't charge him and he'll help you take down the local dealers.
AID00119368	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
AID00119369	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
AID00119370	Leave him alone and he'll share contact information.
AID00119371	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
AID00119372	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
AID00119373	Contreras would like to work with you.
AID00119374	Really now? We had our suspicions about that man, but he's got so many shipments going so many different directions it's been hard to track
AID00119375	What exactly is his offer? Does he realize bribing a Ranger is a hanging offense?
AID00119376	Just perceptive, and I assume you have nothing for sale so I'll be on my way.
AID00119377	You said you were handling Price's goods while he's away?
AID00119378	Yeah. You need something?
AID00119379	Oh... Well, I'll come back when he's around.
AID00119380	Whatever you say, buddy.
AID00119381	Whatever you say, lady.
AID00119382	Goodbye.
AID00119383	Goodbye.
AID00119384	Sorry, still not interested.
AID00119385	Sure. I'll do it.
AID00119386	I'll be back later.
AID00119387	Keep at it. I need to find out what happened.
AID00119388	Can you remember anything else?
AID00119389	Seem to recall a lot of them did business with those scavengers over on the West Side - Dermott and Saint James.
AID00119390	I'm not really interested in running your errands, sorry.
AID00119391	Well, you did ask if we needed help.
AID00119392	What can you tell me about the missing people?
AID00119393	They never seemed to have much in common - that's why I didn't notice it sooner. Young folks, old folks, men, women... all disappearing.
AID00119394	I remember a family with a little blonde girl. She... never talked much, but she always carried this little stuffed teddy bear.
AID00119395	Charming place. Let's talk about something else.
AID00119396	Yeah? Like what?
AID00119397	Sounds like a chaotic place. Is there any way I can help?
AID00119398	Well, I am a little short staffed. Maybe you could give me a hand.
AID00119399	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just up and vanished.
AID00119400	I've also got Keith and his gambling to deal with - I know that skunk's cheating folk out of their savings, I just can't prove it.
AID00119401	I found this teddy bear in Saint James' room. Look familiar?
AID00119402	That... I think that's her teddy bear! It's suspicious, but it doesn't tell us what happened to the refugees.
AID00119403	Damn. Combined with that ledger you found in Dermot's room, it's enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
AID00119404	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
AID00119405	Let me see that... I know these names. Nephi and Cook-Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
AID00119406	But, this just a list of names and not evidence of a direct connection with the missing people.
AID00119407	Damn. Combined with that girl's bear you found in Saint James' room, this is enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
AID00119408	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
AID00119409	What exactly is this place?
AID00119410	This here's where folks go when their luck runs out. Drifters up from the Republic, locals that can't turn a dime, drunken reprobates from all around.
AID00119411	If you don't have the caps to get onto the Strip, odds are you'll end up here.
AID00119412	Tell me about those disappearances again.
AID00119413	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just... up and left.
AID00119414	I remember hearing some of the missing folks were doing business with Dermot and Saint James - a couple of scavengers from Westside.
AID00119415	Who are you?
AID00119416	Captain Parker. I'm in charge of this camp.
AID00119417	Nice doggies. Want a treat?
AID00119418	Hey! No feeding my dogs!
AID00119419	I'm sure they would. I'll just stand over here.
AID00119420	Arf arf! Ha ha!
AID00119421	Would you sell me one?
AID00119422	Sell? Sell?! My dogs! What part don't you get? Mine! Lucky they don't eat you alive for that!
AID00119423	I'll pass, thanks.
AID00119424	Heh. Good. More for me.
AID00119425	Yeah, hook me up!
AID00119426	No! Ha ha! More for me!
AID00119427	I'm not a whore, you ugly bitch.
AID00119428	Then there's no problem here - and no need to get nasty. How can I help you?
AID00119429	Who's the merchandise?
AID00119430	Three flavors to choose from - Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy. Sweetie's the house favorite, for reasons that should be obvious.
AID00119431	Maude is what you might call the discount rack. She's what a customer wears if he doesn't have the caps to afford Sweetie - or just likes them old.
AID00119432	Jimmy's more of a "specialist." I only hear good things.
AID00119433	All right, then. Looks like I need to talk slow and use small words. There's Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy.
AID00119434	Fewer than I used to. Go see for yourself.
AID00119435	Who are you?
AID00119436	Never mind.
AID00119437	Yeah. The LT shouldn't have b-brought that shit up. Not with civvies, anyway. Ain't right.
AID00119438	Ain't right t-talking about this, anyway.
AID00119439	Tell me what happened.
AID00119440	It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
AID00119441	I heard about what happened to Corporal Betsy.
AID00119442	The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit.
AID00119443	Th-this again?
AID00119444	Goodbye.
AID00119445	Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
AID00119446	Whatever. Goodbye.
AID00119447	Yeah. You just walk away. No fool can trump the T-t-ten of Spades!
AID00119448	I shouldn't have insulted you. I'm sorry.
AID00119449	What do you do around here?
AID00119450	Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back.
AID00119451	When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
AID00119452	When did you enlist in the military?
AID00119453	Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass.
AID00119454	How long have you been a sharpshooter?
AID00119455	Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
AID00119456	Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too.
AID00119457	Ten of Spades. Where did you get that name?
AID00119458	The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead.
AID00119459	It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
AID00119460	I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
AID00119461	You're right. I'm sorry.
AID00119462	Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. Just shows they l-l-like me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
AID00119463	No cause for w-w-w-what?
AID00119464	Yeah, r-right. That's Brahmin shit. Lucky for you we're on b-b-base, and I can't start trouble with civvies. How 'bout you get l-l-lost?
AID00119465	Are you s-s-sure?
AID00119466	Hey. No cause for th-that.
AID00119467	Are you all right?
AID00119468	Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass.
AID00119469	I take it you're from Klamath?
AID00119470	Heh, yeah good old Klamath. Not a bad place if you like hunting, eating, and skinning geckos all day! Heh heh.
AID00119471	It's a pretty dull place, but I hear there was a bit of excitement when this tribal from Arroyo came to town years back. All before my time, though.
AID00119472	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00119473	All right, then. Hopefully I've got something to wet your whistle.
AID00119474	Come talk to me when I'm in my store and I'll be glad to do business with you.
AID00119475	VFreeformMcCarran2POW2Speech
AID00119476	Is something the matter, Silus? You look upset.
AID00119477	Here, maybe you'd better step out for a moment. You've upset him.
AID00119478	Your friend is a miserable fucking degenerate.
AID00119479	I don't know, I thought she seemed like a nice lady.
AID00119480	I don't know, I thought he seemed like a nice guy.
AID00119481	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have her torn apart by dogs.
AID00119482	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have him torn apart by dogs.
AID00119483	That's a long walk, Silus. I don't think it's gonna happen. You'd better just talk.
AID00119484	Your tactics are a joke.
AID00119485	If you don't like dealing with me, I can bring my friend back in.
AID00119486	Both of you can rot.
AID00119487	Have it your way.
AID00119488	Come on back in. I think he misses you.
AID00119489	VFreeformMcCarran2POW2Beating
AID00119490	Whoa, easy there! You're supposed to rough him up a little, not kill him.
AID00119491	Why don't you step outside a minute? Let off some steam.
AID00119492	Nice job.
AID00119493	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep her under control.
AID00119494	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep him under control.
AID00119495	You think this'll make me talk? A beating. This the best you can do?
AID00119496	Not just any beating, Silus. A savage beating. A beating that you'll be reminded of every time you feel pain from now on.
AID00119497	When my friend's done with you, you won't have any of your teeth left. You'll be drinking your food through a straw.
AID00119498	Your ribs will never heal properly and it will hurt every time you breathe.
AID00119499	It'll be like your collars, Silus. Impossible to forget.
AID00119500	Go to hell.
AID00119501	Huh. Not the sort of wit I've come to expect from you, Silus.
AID00119502	You're getting nothing from me.
AID00119503	I'm getting entertainment. That's something. So what's it gonna be?
AID00119504	Are you going to spill your guts to me, or am I going to let my friend the maniac back in here for some play time? Silus?
AID00119505	Silent treatment, huh? Have it your way.
AID00119506	Come on back in. I think he misses you. Oh, and let me check you for weapons, one more time. For your safety as well as his.
AID00119507	VFreeformMcCarran2POW2Int
AID00119508	All that shouting. Honestly, Silus, you get free room and board. The least you could do is be a good guest.
AID00119509	Lieutenant, this woman is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
AID00119510	Lieutenant, this man is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
AID00119511	My, we have an active imagination today, don't we?
AID00119512	Think about it! Is it worth the risk? You need what I know.
AID00119513	Well, it sounds like the two of you are becoming fast friends.
AID00119514	It'll be your head if I die, Lieutenant. You'll be disgraced.
AID00119515	You know what? I think you're right, Silus.
AID00119516	Of course I'm right.
AID00119517	Except I don't care, because it'll be worth it.
AID00119518	It'll be worth it to never have to hear you say another word, Silus.
AID00119519	Carry on.
AID00119520	Lieutenant!
AID00119521	VFreeformMcCarran2POW1
AID00119522	Long time, no see, Silus.
AID00119523	Lieutenant. I was just thinking about you.
AID00119524	That so?
AID00119525	I was. I was just thinking about that pretty neck of yours.
AID00119526	How sweet.
AID00119527	I was thinking about how it would look with a Legion slave collar on it.
AID00119528	I'll pass.
AID00119529	Do you know what I love about our slave collars, Lieutenant?
AID00119530	If you love them, maybe you should try one on.
AID00119531	I love how tightly they fit.
AID00119532	I train my men to make sure the slaves' flesh bulges a bit around the top and bottom. Know why?
AID00119533	It's all the rage in fashion circles.
AID00119534	Not quite. If you fit it just right, their body never gets used to the feeling of wearing it.
AID00119535	It cuts in just enough when they swallow or turn their head to remind them who they belong to.
AID00119536	And it's that constant reminder that keeps them docile.
AID00119537	In that case, maybe you'd better save the collar you were going to give me.
AID00119538	Oh? For whom?
AID00119539	For a friend of mine you're about to meet. My friend isn't very docile.
AID00119540	And who is this friend of yours?
AID00119541	You know all the rules the NCR instituted to protect enemy prisoners of war?
AID00119542	Of course.
AID00119543	My friend doesn't.
AID00119544	Oh, and Silus? If you resist at all, I'll personally blow your brains out.
AID00119545	Come on in. He's all yours. I'll be back in a bit to see how you're getting along.
AID00119546	And I'll need you to surrender your weapons before you go in. You can pick them up from the locker on your way out.
AID00119547	WestsidePeacekeeperTaunt
AID00119548	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
AID00119549	You got his book? Dermot, this bastard got your book! He got your book!
AID00119550	You got his book? Dermot, this bitch got your book! She got your book!
AID00119551	Look what I found in your room. <Show him the teddy bear.>
AID00119552	What you doing stealing my stuff? That ain't even mine. I mean it's mine, but it's private. Give it back!
AID00119553	Hell, don't give it back! I don't care. Just found it when we was working salvage and thought I'd save it to give to some kid if one came by.
AID00119554	VCasaStJames
AID00119555	Some people have gone missing, and they were last seen dealing with you.
AID00119556	I don't know a thing about no missing refugees from that Aerotech camp. Go cry to somebody else.
AID00119557	What do you do around here?
AID00119558	Me and Dermot work salvage around New Vegas.
AID00119559	VMS07FiendRadio
AID00119560	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at her.
AID00119561	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at him.
AID00119562	Okay, I'll tell him.
AID00119563	And get the fuck away from me before I cave in your skull!
AID00119564	It is? Really?
AID00119565	No, you fucking dolt! Why the hell would it be a pleasure?!
AID00119566	How many NCR citizens you figure you've killed with that club?
AID00119567	Huh? Oh, lots. More than any other Fiend - hundreds, maybe. Wham, bam, "oh god, my brains, you hit me in my brains." Easy as that.
AID00119568	I hear you came from Utah. A friend of yours asked me to check on you. Bert?
AID00119569	Bert? That scaly, corpse-looking fuck, you tell him I'm never going back to his little cult!
AID00119570	That's a nice club you've got there.
AID00119571	Fuckin' A right it is. This baby's my life, my love, my strong right arm. Killed a lot of fuckers with this hunk of iron, yessir.
AID00119572	Who are you?
AID00119573	Name's Nephi, friend. Driver Nephi. Pleasure to meet you.
AID00119574	Can you tell me about Cook-Cook and Violet?
AID00119575	I *could.* I'm not terribly inclined to, though. If you go talk to them, they might kill you and rob me of the fun.
AID00119576	Really? Listen... you don't want to mess with Cook-Cook. And you *really* don't want to let him get you alone. Trust me.
AID00119577	I've never been more disturbed in my entire life.
AID00119578	Oh. You've got a little pet. How sweet.
AID00119579	You are! Yes that's right!
AID00119580	I'll remember that.
AID00119581	Goddamn right.
AID00119582	Why do they call you Cook-Cook?
AID00119583	If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
AID00119584	What's a "Queenie?"
AID00119585	*That's* Queenie. She's the prettiest Brahmin in the Wastelands. Aren't you, Queenie, yes you are, who's a good girl?
AID00119586	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00119587	NCR? Bunch of soft little bitches, they've got no stomach for life in the wasteland. Got some choice strange, though, I'll give 'em that.
AID00119588	Heh heh... yeah. I'll give 'em *that* all right.
AID00119589	So, you cook all these animals around here?
AID00119590	That's right. Brahmin, mole rats, lizards... the occasional traveler lost in the wrong part of town.
AID00119591	Not Queenie though. I'd never cook my Queenie.
AID00119592	Do you know Violet and Driver Nephi?
AID00119593	Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
AID00119594	Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
AID00119595	And after they're done... I get to play with whatever's left.
AID00119596	Who are you?
AID00119597	Who am I? I'm the scariest motherfucker you're ever gonna meet. I'm Cook-Cook, bitch, better not forget it.
AID00119598	If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
AID00119599	So, why do they call you Cook-Cook, anyway?
AID00119600	Jet's not my drug of choice. I'll keep looking.
AID00119601	Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
AID00119602	I'll take it.
AID00119603	And here you go. Enjoy, my friend.
AID00119604	Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
AID00119605	I don't have that much on me.
AID00119606	Marked cards, huh? A little bit obvious, but not bad.
AID00119607	Hey, it's not like I use them all the time. Mostly I keep them in my shack until I see a really fat score roll into town.
AID00119608	I think I'll pass for now.
AID00119609	Your loss.
AID00119610	Boy... I sure could use some drugs. You know anybody that sells drugs?
AID00119611	[FAILED] What? Are you some kind of idiot? Why, uh... why would I know that?
AID00119612	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I getcha. Lookin for a slightly more chemical thrill?
AID00119613	Okay, I tell you what - I happen to keep some Jet around for emergencies. 35 caps and it's yours.
AID00119614	Gambling's not my scene. Maybe you could hook me up with something "medicinal?"
AID00119615	From what I hear, your players are pretty unlucky. What's your secret?
AID00119616	[FAILED] I guess Lady Luck just smiles on me, that's all. Nothing special about it.
AID00119617	[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
AID00119618	I've run some cons in my day - one clever bastard to another, what's your trick?
AID00119619	Who are you?
AID00119620	Name's Keith. You feeling lucky? I got games of chance, games of skill, games of you-name-it. Want to win a little cash?
AID00119621	I'll leave this one to the law.
AID00119622	Fair enough - you've done a lot already. I appreciate it.
AID00119623	Sure, I'm in. Why not?
AID00119624	Glad to have you. Let's go. Just stick close and follow my lead. Keith's a cowardly son of a bitch, but he might try something if he's desperate.
AID00119625	Tell me about Keith again.
AID00119626	Marked cards, huh? I suppose it's obvious, really. Here, you've earned this.
AID00119627	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
AID00119628	I've got evidence - Keith has a set of marked cards he uses to cheat.
AID00119629	Son of a bitch - I knew he was involved with drugs. Thanks - this gives me the evidence I need. Here - you've earned this.
AID00119630	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
AID00119631	I've got evidence - Keith is selling drugs to the locals.
AID00119632	Drugs and crooked gambling? Can't say I'm surprised. Here, you've earned this.
AID00119633	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
AID00119634	I've got proof that Keith is selling drugs and using marked cards.
AID00119635	Tell me about this "Keith."
AID00119636	Keith's a two-bit hustler, he runs a gambling operation out of his shack. Ask me, he wins way too often to be playing fair.
AID00119637	I suspect he's running drugs, too, I just can't prove it. Maybe you can find something - talk to him, poke around his shack, something.
AID00119638	Goodbye.
AID00119639	Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones...
AID00119640	You don't have to leave, girl. Better yet, come and find me when I'm off duty.
AID00119641	Yeah. Try not to get killed.
AID00119642	I've killed so many people, I don't even think about it.
AID00119643	Yeah, well, we can't all be heartless shitheads, right?
AID00119644	First I've heard about conscience in a while.
AID00119645	Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked-up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
AID00119646	Might just be sex, though. I see some cute little number, and I'd rather get in her pants. So maybe I'm a stone-cold bitch, after all.
AID00119647	Yeah, doesn't sound like me at all, right? But it happens.
AID00119648	What do you mean?
AID00119649	Legion fights to win. And they're smart... hell of a lot smarter than these crazy Fiends. But I don't feel bad about shooting Legion boys.
AID00119650	Fiends, on the other hand... sometimes I get some pangs of conscience. Not often. But sometimes.
AID00119651	Have you seen any serious combat here?
AID00119652	Not unless you count the Fiends as serious. Gorobets keeps us inside the fence, most of the time. Doesn't matter to me, I just shoot bad guys.
AID00119653	Sooner or later, they'll move us out to the Dam, though. That's when the shit gets nasty.
AID00119654	How about a date? I like tough women.
AID00119655	Yeah, right. You're sniffing up the wrong skirt. Try me again when you're tall, blonde, and female.
AID00119656	Thanks for your help with Usanagi and all, but I still like them tall, blonde, and female.
AID00119657	Actually, I didn't notice the attitude until just now.
AID00119658	Hah! See, we've even got the same sense of humor. I like a girl who doesn't piss me off after sex.
AID00119659	Hah! You're not as dumb as I thought you'd be. We got the same sense of humor.
AID00119660	Probably better to walk away while I still like you, though. All kinds of things piss me off. Like just about anything that anybody says.
AID00119661	So snipers work in pairs?
AID00119662	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
AID00119663	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. Now if they paired me up with somebody who looks like you...
AID00119664	Lot of downtime in the army. Nobody around but you and your partner. Plenty of time for... whatever we want.
AID00119665	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
AID00119666	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. I keep hoping they'll pair me up with some hot blonde, like you see on those old pinups.
AID00119667	Shit, I don't even care if she can shoot straight. Can't have everything.
AID00119668	Who's your partner?
AID00119669	The little guy. 10 of Spades. I like him because he listens. Doesn't shut up the rest of the time, but when I talk, he listens.
AID00119670	Also, he doesn't pull any stupid come-ons, like practically every other horn-dog alpha male on this base. Might be he's just scared of me, though.
AID00119671	I didn't know that all snipers wear shades.
AID00119672	They don't. Only the good ones do.
AID00119673	My partner's got some potential, so I let him wear those goofy glasses. I tell him they're his training shades. He totally buys it.
AID00119674	Truth is, his eyes just suck.
AID00119675	The big gun.
AID00119676	Don't take this the wrong way, but girl, it's a damn good thing you're hot. That sarcasm blew right over your head, didn't it?
AID00119677	Yup. Lot of people make that connection. Big gun. Sniper. Some people don't even need to ask.
AID00119678	You're a sniper?
AID00119679	What gave me away? The big gun, the shades, or the attitude?
AID00119680	I thought you should know. Cook-cook is dead.
AID00119681	You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy.
AID00119682	Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would.
AID00119683	Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment.
AID00119684	You were raped. That's not something you can just shrug off.
AID00119685	Never said it was. But I don't need to talk to any doctors. Especially not the pricks around here.
AID00119686	If I was smart, I'd fake a big old breakdown. That'd make everybody happy, and I'd get some leave time.
AID00119687	But then I'd be doing what everybody wants, and being the asshole that I am, it just wouldn't feel right. Got to have some integrity.
AID00119688	10 of Spades blames himself.
AID00119689	Yeah. Typical. Thing is, that fat pile of shit sneaked up on us from behind and kicked little 10 in the back of the head.
AID00119690	Knocked him out cold. Probably meant to kill him. The kid had no idea what happened until he woke up in the infirmary.
AID00119691	10 wants to blame himself, I can't stop him. He'll work it through on his own.
AID00119692	Don't you want some payback?
AID00119693	What kind of dumbass question is that? Of course I want payback.
AID00119694	If I get hold of that fat pile of shit, I'll shove my rifle up his ass a couple hundred times, see how he likes it.
AID00119695	Then I'll fire some shells up in there, make sure he doesn't ever forget me. He left me a bunch of souvenirs - I figure I can do the same.
AID00119696	So yeah. Payback would be good. Doesn't mean I need to have myself a big long cry.
AID00119697	I heard you were raped by Cook-cook.
AID00119698	Can't stop talking about that, can they? The Lieutenant actually sat me down and asked if I wanted to talk to a doctor.
AID00119699	Wouldn't believe me when I told him to forget it. I mean, if that slab of meat had gotten me pregnant, then maybe I'd want to talk to a doctor.
AID00119700	VFreeformMcCarran2POWCleanup
AID00119701	Mind cleaning up our mess, Corporal?
AID00119702	Not at all, ma'am. I'll get right on it.
AID00119703	Tell me about Maude.
AID00119704	Old Maude... Sometimes you can afford the creamy veal of a Sweetie, and sometimes you got just enough caps to buy a tough piece of jerky. 
AID00119705	GorobetsGetIntoPosition
AID00119706	We're here. First Recon, get into your positions and wait for the target.
AID00119707	Sorry, not interested.
AID00119708	Damn shame. I've got some leave time coming to me, and I booked a suite at the Gomorrah. The two of us, rolled up in those silk sheets...
AID00119709	That's a little forward, don't you think?
AID00119710	Yeah. So what? I could take a bullet in the skull tomorrow. I haven't got time to take it slow and subtle.
AID00119711	I see somebody I like, I go ahead and tell her. That's about the only thing that the horn-dog males get right.
AID00119712	Yes. But never a woman.
AID00119713	Trust me, the alpha males are overrated. Plenty of them in the army. All they're good for is killing each other and taking smelly shits.
AID00119714	I'm just saying... never know what you might like, if you don't give it a try.
AID00119715	That's too bad, but not my problem.
AID00119716	Hey, you asked, I answered.
AID00119717	Okay, I'll look into it.
AID00119718	Glad to hear it.
AID00119719	ParkerHelp
AID00119720	Well... that was a bit messier than I would have liked. Was there anything else?
AID00119721	You're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00119722	I surely am. Well, sort of. I came out from Utah about six months back, saw a need for my help here.
AID00119723	The Followers weren't too happy about that, of course. They haven't been too fond of the NCR for a while, but I go where I'm needed.
AID00119724	What do you do here?
AID00119725	I give what aid and comfort I can. I have medical knowledge thanks to my time with the Followers.
AID00119726	What happened to your friend Nephi?
AID00119727	I never was able to reach him. He has allowed drugs and hatred to consume him. He runs with the Fiends north of here, now. They call him Driver Nephi.
AID00119728	What was it that brought you out here from Utah?
AID00119729	Following a lost cause, I'm afraid. My old friend Nephi fell in with a bad crowd.
AID00119730	Drug runners, raiders, probably worse things it's better not to dwell on. When his gang headed west, I followed.
AID00119731	I thought perhaps I could turn him back to the Church.
AID00119732	Who are you?
AID00119733	Well, that's an interesting question. Among the Church, I'm called Elder Gunnarsson. The Followers call me "Doc."
AID00119734	You can call me Bert, though.
AID00119735	What's the deal with all these refugees?
AID00119736	Poor lost souls, most of them. They thought to come to New Vegas and find their fortunes on its shining Strip.
AID00119737	But the journey is often long, and the price to enter the city is steep. Those who could not pay ended up here, hoping to earn the caps they need.
AID00119738	Some find honest labor, but more fritter away what little they've saved on crooked gambling and cheap liquor. Still, I minister to them as I can.
AID00119739	NellisArgyllPatientHealed
AID00119740	Excellent treatment. I hadn't thought of that!
AID00119741	I thought that man was done for, but you brought him around.
AID00119742	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
AID00119743	FiendTalk1
AID00119744	You didn't have a choice. The Fiends were a growing threat.
AID00119745	You did the right thing. If you'd sent more, they'd have been killed.
AID00119746	That's probably true, but I wonder if I should've taken a different strategy entirely.
AID00119747	Although my options were certainly limited with most of our forces tied up garrisoning this place.
AID00119748	I don't understand how you could be so careless with the life of a ranger.
AID00119749	I'd hoped he'd be able to slip past their security and be out before anyone knew he was there.
AID00119750	But I underestimated the Fiends. Should've known better, given the hell they've caused for us.
AID00119751	Regardless, what you did for Anders isn't something he or any of us around here take lightly. We're all glad to have him back. Thank you.
AID00119752	Motor-runner is dead. I brought his helmet as proof.
AID00119753	Unbelievable. That man has given us so much grief since we set up here. This may be a major turning point for us.
AID00119754	I can't tell you how many times we thought we'd taken him out, only to have him show up again later, taking more heads off of fallen troopers.
AID00119755	This is for the bounty. And this is from a pool me and a lot of the soldiers around the base had going. You may not be NCR, but hey, it's only fair.
AID00119756	Timeo Danaos et dona ferentis. I posed as a mercenary to get inside the walls.
AID00119757	Legum servi sumus. We are both slaves to Caesar's law. And you are in violation.
AID00119758	How naive, Silus. Corruptio optimi pessima. Caesar sees you as a threat now.
AID00119759	What's going on in Westside?
AID00119760	I try to keep my people out of Westside. Apart from trying to stay on good terms with the Khans, who do business there. There's Mean Son of A Bitch.
AID00119761	That fucking mutant is more trouble to kill than to avoid. Having someplace for my people to sleep reduces the chances of drifting into Westside.
AID00119762	FiendRaid2
AID00119763	FiendRaid1
AID00119764	FiendMoreChems2
AID00119765	I gave my last hit of Psycho to this hot little chick last night.
AID00119766	Motor-Runner told me he was going to pick up some more when the Khans come back through.
AID00119767	FiendMoreChems1
AID00119768	I got some to last me a little bit I think.
AID00119769	Yeah, me too. Gonna have to go hit the boss for a fix soon.
AID00119770	FiendShakes2
AID00119771	I don't feel right. My head is fucking with me.
AID00119772	Shit. I gotta go find something to take the edge off.
AID00119773	FiendShakes1
AID00119774	Yeah, you don't look too good.
AID00119775	Me too. I think I need a fix.
AID00119776	FiendBadShit2
AID00119777	I don't know. If you can't trust dealers, who can you trust?
AID00119778	I got it from my buddy. I think he made it himself.
AID00119779	FiendBadShit1
AID00119780	Where'd you get it from?
AID00119781	Fuck! I did too. I'm not doing well.
AID00119782	FiendOuttaMyFace
AID00119783	Sorry. I'm moving.
AID00119784	I didn't say anything.
AID00119785	FiendWhatLooking2
AID00119786	Get the fuck out of may way.
AID00119787	Well keep moving.
AID00119788	FiendWhatLooking1
AID00119789	I'm not looking at anything.
AID00119790	I'm looking at you.
AID00119791	FiendNeedAFix2
AID00119792	Damn, I gotta find some shit.
AID00119793	FiendNeedAFix1
AID00119794	I can't help you.
AID00119795	You and me both.
AID00119796	FiendGotAnyJet2
AID00119797	Lying bitch.
AID00119798	Fuck, I need a fix.
AID00119799	FiendGotAnyJet1
AID00119800	All I have is Psycho.
AID00119801	Nope, not for you at least.
AID00119802	Why did you move the Fiends into this Vault?
AID00119803	We needed some place to put down some roots. I was having trouble keeping my people out of  Westside.
AID00119804	I'd hate to kill you over a misunderstanding, but if that's what you want...
AID00119805	[SUCCEEDED] No, no, it's all right. We're just looking out for our own, you understand. We're, uh, sorry to bother you.
AID00119806	All right, let's get this over with. I've got better things to do.
AID00119807	It'll be hard for you to do anything once we break your arms and legs.
AID00119808	Look, all I did was talk to him. It's no big deal.
AID00119809	[FAILED] Right. No big deal. We're going to beat the hell out of you now, but don't worry - we don't think it's a big deal, either.
AID00119810	What do you guys want?
AID00119811	We saw you follow the kid in there. Figured we'd teach you a lesson.
AID00119812	Goodbye.
AID00119813	Oh, no you don't. Time to teach you to mess with our people!
AID00119814	How long have you been stationed here?
AID00119815	Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
AID00119816	'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
AID00119817	Whole things smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps that he's stirring up the locals against us.
AID00119818	Thanks for the information.
AID00119819	No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up.
AID00119820	Then again... that light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
AID00119821	Have you seen anything suspicious around here?
AID00119822	As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
AID00119823	Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
AID00119824	Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
AID00119825	And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
AID00119826	Interesting rifle you have there. Lever-action, right?
AID00119827	I call her La Longue Carabine. Didn't always have the scope - I added that myself.
AID00119828	Been shooting with her so long... couldn't bring myself to toss her away. Would have felt guilty to part with the old girl.
AID00119829	The other snipers use bolt-action, but Gorobets reckoned it didn't matter none if I was different, so long as I can hit my targets.
AID00119830	How did you manage to escape Malpais?
AID00119831	Caesar's boys figured I wasn't going anywhere, after what they done to me. So they didn't bother tying me up.
AID00119832	I crawled out of there on my elbows and knees. Must have looked a sight. Then I rolled down an embankment into the Colorado.
AID00119833	Guess I had a mind to drown, rather than give Caesar's boys the satisfaction of killing me.
AID00119834	But a couple Rangers happened to be watching from across the river. They jumped on in and pulled me out of there. Lucky break, they said.
AID00119835	Why did you leave the Rangers?
AID00119836	Well... that wasn't really a matter of choice. Got myself caught by Legionnaires, up near Malpais.
AID00119837	They had themselves some fun with me... mangled my hands and feet pretty good.
AID00119838	Wasn't much good with a pistol after that. Wasn't gonna be trekking across the waste on any more long scouts, either.
AID00119839	Have you always been with the First Recon?
AID00119840	Used to be a Ranger... one of the first they sent out east, back before we took the Dam. Observation and reconnaissance.
AID00119841	We took the lay of the land, checked out the locals, and kept ourselves inconspicuous. Couple friends of mine were the first to scout the Dam.
AID00119842	That was back in '73, if I recall. Lot of those Rangers are dead now.
AID00119843	Vegas always chewed men up... it's just a little more literal, nowadays.
AID00119844	Goodbye.
AID00119845	Mighty pleased to meet you. Maybe I'll see you again, before we move out.
AID00119846	Always a pleasure. You keep yourself safe.
AID00119847	It's true. I've got a memorable face.
AID00119848	You're a fine-looking woman, no doubt about that. But I'm looking a little deeper than the skin, if you take my meaning.
AID00119849	Not so long ago, I spent more than my share of time lookin' for memorable folk like yourself. Did a lot of scoutin' around these parts.
AID00119850	You remember everyone who passes through here?
AID00119851	Got a good memory for faces. Landmarks and such, too. Comes with practice, that's all. And a lot of scoutin' from place to place.
AID00119852	I reckon I've walked every inch of ground between Shady Sands and the Colorado... or close enough to make a man's feet plenty sore.
AID00119853	Good for you.
AID00119854	That's noble of you.
AID00119855	I only do what I can to help.
AID00119856	Can you heal me?
AID00119857	I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
AID00119858	I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
AID00119859	I'm afraid I have exhausted my supplies. If you come back in a day or two, I may be able to do more for you.
AID00119860	Not yet.
AID00119861	Please, hurry!
AID00119862	Dead as a doornail. Shouldn't have left her in the desert, Frankie.
AID00119863	I'm sorry. She didn't make it.
AID00119864	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving my children, at least.
AID00119865	Where did they go?
AID00119866	<Honest Option>
AID00119867	Oh God no! I haven't been the best father, but I didn't deserve this!
AID00119868	Yes. They're all dead.
AID00119869	They are? Oh my God, thank you! Thank you so much!
AID00119870	But wait, where are they?
AID00119871	Yes. They're all alive.
AID00119872	Oh, thank you! Thank you!
AID00119873	But wait, what about my wife?
AID00119874	Your children are alive.
AID00119875	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving her, at least.
AID00119876	But wait, where is she?
AID00119877	Your children are dead, but your wife made it.
AID00119878	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving the rest, at least.
AID00119879	But wait, where are they?
AID00119880	Your wife and one of the children made it out alive.
AID00119881	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving one of them, at least.
AID00119882	But wait, where is my child?
AID00119883	Your wife and one of your children are dead.
AID00119884	They would have killed you if you fought. Maybe I can help you find them.
AID00119885	Wait a minute - why didn't they take you, too?
AID00119886	I... God help me, I ran! I abandoned my family to those butchers. Not a day goes by I don't hate myself for that.
AID00119887	I'm so sorry. Can I help?
AID00119888	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you, friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower - as if this city is more important.
AID00119889	From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
AID00119890	Wow, some protector you turned out to be.
AID00119891	Go ahead, mock me. Nothing you say can be worse than my own shame.
AID00119892	See you later.
AID00119893	Get it done.
AID00119894	The guy claiming to stand in for Price is dead.
AID00119895	Good to hear.
AID00119896	Well, I'd say you're officially invited to the big kids' table now. My stash is your stash.
AID00119897	Oh, and I think you might get more use out of this rifle than I ever will. Enjoy.
AID00119898	I convinced the Ranger to work with you.  You're safe, but be careful.
AID00119899	Price wasn't there.  I fought some guy claiming to be his replacement.
AID00119900	Well, it sounds like you screwed the pooch. Give me the package back.
AID00119901	Price works alone. If someone has replaced him, it's either some scumbag trying to hijack goods from his suppliers, or worse...
AID00119902	It could be someone more dangerous. You need to kill him, whoever he is.
AID00119903	Some guy is standing in for Price.  I didn't inquire further.
AID00119904	Huh. Not good. Price works alone. Chat him up and see what's going on.
AID00119905	Don't give him any details and do not give him the package. There's a chance he actually knows Price, but I doubt it.
AID00119906	VMS08MonorailGuardWarn2
AID00119907	You had your chance.
AID00119908	That's it.
AID00119909	VMS08MonorailGuardWarn1
AID00119910	Go on through, soldier.
AID00119911	Go right ahead, trooper.
AID00119912	Hold it. NCR only beyond this point. Keep your distance or I will fire.
AID00119913	Sorry. No civilians on the monorail. Any closer and I am authorized to use deadly force.
AID00119914	You sure know how to make a girl feel welcome.
AID00119915	Just needed to make the situation clear is all. How can I help you?
AID00119916	In the right hands, it could do a lot of good. I'll see it gets there.
AID00119917	I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
AID00119918	Do you know how many caps I can get for it?
AID00119919	Ah, I should have known. Well, in that case...
AID00119920	That data is valuable to me.
AID00119921	What do you mean?
AID00119922	Why is the door to the entrance locked?
AID00119923	Are you kidding me? This place is under quarantine! We can't let a single spore get out of this place if we can help it.
AID00119924	What were you doing down in that cave?
AID00119925	The mantises and spore plants virtually ignored me for most of the time that I've been here.
AID00119926	It was only once I began to investigate the fifth level that my presence began to agitate them. I guess I was a little too close to home for them.
AID00119927	A few days ago, I was attacked by a large number of mantises and was knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I was in that cave.
AID00119928	The mantises seem to feed some of their prey to the plants. Fortunately for me, it appears the plants are disinclined to eat ghoul meat.
AID00119929	What happened to the scientists, then?
AID00119930	Something prevented them from igniting the gas, obviously. I suppose it's possible that the gas triggered some kind of defensive reaction.
AID00119931	Hordes of previously slumbering creatures may have awoken and entered a killing frenzy, ripping the hapless scientists into quivering, bloody chunks.
AID00119932	You'll have to let me know when you get back from going downstairs.
AID00119933	How did you get this whole gas thing set up so quickly?
AID00119934	That's a very good question! Actually, I didn't come up with it. The systems were already set up to pump the gas when I first arrived here.
AID00119935	I believe the scientists were in the process of attempting to ignite the gas just as we're about to do. And by we, I mean you, of course.
AID00119936	Where did these plants come from?
AID00119937	From what I've been able to determine, the scientists here managed to breed them by combining traits from two distinct plant species.
AID00119938	The resulting hybrid proved more adaptable than expected, however, and soon became a threat to humans.
AID00119939	It's sad, really. All those wonderful minds, undone by their own irresponsibility.
AID00119940	No way. I'm not going to torch myself for your amusement.
AID00119941	It would be pretty funny, wouldn't it? Oh, don't look at me that way. I'm sure you'll be fine.
AID00119942	And?
AID00119943	What? Do I have to figure everything out for you? Fine, let me think for a second.
AID00119944	Blast?
AID00119945	Yes, there'll be an explosion when the gas is ignited. But I'm sure you'll be fine. Now leave me to my work.
AID00119946	How am I supposed to survive that?
AID00119947	That does pose a problem, doesn't it?
AID00119948	If you could seal yourself inside a room before the explosion went off, you might be protected from the blast.
AID00119949	Then again, the flames will probably blow into the rooms down there. Maybe if there were a room that was reinforced...
AID00119950	Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
AID00119951	Did you say there'd be a blast?
AID00119952	Oh yes, I imagine there'll be quite an explosion when the gas gets set off. Fire will probably expand throughout the entire level in mere moments.
AID00119953	How exactly should I ignite the gas?
AID00119954	In the area where the gas is active, any kind of fire or explosion should do the trick. Hell, even lasers would do the job.
AID00119955	If you don't have anything like that, I've got some grenades in my bag in the corner that you can use.
AID00119956	No questions right now. I'll be going.
AID00119957	Well in that case, leave me to my work.
AID00119958	GorobetsMoveOut
AID00119959	Get your rifles and move out, First Recon. We've got a Fiend to kill.
AID00119960	Fascinating. Let's talk about something else.
AID00119961	Sure thing. Careful, though. I'll talk your ear off.
AID00119962	Never mind, I was mistaken.
AID00119963	Aww.
AID00119964	[Attack] The bad news is I'm here to relieve you of your life.
AID00119965	What- What are you doing?
AID00119966	Good news, private. I'm here to relieve you.
AID00119967	Really? That's great. I was getting so sick of this.
AID00119968	[Attack] I'm going to get you in trouble for blowing up the monorail.
AID00119969	What? Like hell you are.
AID00119970	<Pull Pin>I just pulled the pin out of somebody's grenade.
AID00119971	Man, I can't wait to see the look on his face!
AID00119972	That's great because I'm in the middle of pulling a prank right now.
AID00119973	No kidding! What'd you cook up?
AID00119974	What kinds of pranks have you pulled?
AID00119975	Aw, usual stuff. Brought a brahmin upstairs in the terminal once. They can go upstairs but not down. Two heads and both of 'em dumb as stumps.
AID00119976	That got me some detention time, but it was worth it 'cause they couldn't get the brahmin back down, so it visited me a few times in my cell.
AID00119977	Dropped some firecrackers in the toilets too. That was the real bad one for me.
AID00119978	Turns out there's no way to replace the toilets now. Toilet company blew up in the War. I think they'd just have shot me if they weren't shorthanded.
AID00119979	I've heard you're kind of a prankster.
AID00119980	Heh. My reputation precedes me, I see. Yeah I pulled a few pranks in my time.
AID00119981	Where is Private Crenshaw's footlocker?
AID00119982	It's in the main concourse. That's the building just across the skybridge. There's a barracks area that'll be behind you on the left when you enter.
AID00119983	His stuff will be at the foot of one of the beds.
AID00119984	Where can I find Private Crenshaw again?
AID00119985	He's stationed just inside the south wall of the base. Should be on patrol, if he isn't screwing around.
AID00119986	VFreeformMcCarran2POWEnough
AID00119987	All right, you can stop for a sec.
AID00119988	You don't really mean what you said about your parents, do you?
AID00119989	Goodbye.
AID00119990	All right. Goodbye.
AID00119991	Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
AID00119992	Okay. I will. Guess that's something I'd rather not talk about, that's all.
AID00119993	I really don't know. Come on, Sergeant, you can tell me.
AID00119994	[FAILED] No. What's it matter to you? Why's everybody care so much about other people's business?
AID00119995	Just leave it lie. And leave me be.
AID00119996	You're not telling me something. You couldn't have forgotten the whole massacre.
AID00119997	It's like I tell Major Dhatri. Best not look under a rock, if you don't really want to know what's there.
AID00119998	Could be that NCR found some blood on me, and none of it mine. Could be that a few of those Khans didn't die from NCR bullets.
AID00119999	I had scores of my own to settle... deeper ones than NCR ever had. Don't bother asking who they were with.
AID00120000	How did you survive the massacre?
AID00120001	Guess I could tell a pretty good story, if I had a mind. But the truth is, I don't know. Just got lucky.
AID00120002	They brought me to Dhatri after the battle. He was just a Captain, back then. Guess he saw something in me... knew I didn't belong with the Khans.
AID00120003	Maybe he felt bad, too. About how his men killed my folks. I told him he did me a service, but he didn't believe me. Still doesn't.
AID00120004	He's a good man, Dhatri. Doesn't act like it sometimes, I know. But he didn't have to take me in.
AID00120005	So your name... it comes from Bitter Springs.
AID00120006	In the Khans, you're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
AID00120007	After that - if you haven't begged for mercy - you get to choose a new name. One you'll use for the rest of your life.
AID00120008	When NCR slaughtered the Khans at Bitter Springs, I hadn't got my beat-down yet. I was still too young.
AID00120009	Way I see it, Bitter Springs was my beat-down. So afterward... I gave myself a name. It's all I've got from the Khans, and it's all I ever want.
AID00120010	You don't really mean that, do you?
AID00120011	Don't I? Mister, you never met my parents.
AID00120012	Don't I? Beg pardon, ma'am, but you never met my parents.
AID00120013	My dad, he got himself fucked up, every chance he got. Always started with folk for no reason.
AID00120014	Hell, he was the one who taught me to shoot. You know how? By taking potshots at NCR. And not just soldiers. Civilians, too. Even kids.
AID00120015	Then he'd get high with his buddies and swap tales about the folk they killed. Bunch of animals.
AID00120016	And my mom... couple times she tried to sell me to some waster, just to score some Jet. Even the other Khans said she was useless.
AID00120017	Only reason they kept her around was because she was a... how'd my dad say it... "a smokin' piece of ass."
AID00120018	Losing your parents must have been hard for you. I'm sorry.
AID00120019	You're sorry? Well, that makes one of us. Bitter Springs was the best thing that ever happened to me.
AID00120020	Best thing that ever happened to my parents, too. They were as bad as the rest. Worse, maybe.
AID00120021	I've heard enough. Let's talk about something else.
AID00120022	Yeah. That's probably best.
AID00120023	Tell me about happened to them at Bitter Springs.
AID00120024	It was massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
AID00120025	But I was there. Saw it myself. I don't care what anybody says. The Khans asked for Bitter Springs. They wouldn't leave the NCR be.
AID00120026	My damn parents, too. They were just as bad as the rest.
AID00120027	What do you know about the Great Khans?
AID00120028	They're scum. Lazy, trumped-up Raiders. Most of the time, they're drunk or high, and when they're not shooting chems, they're selling them.
AID00120029	Used to have a settlement up at Bitter Springs, 'til they pissed off NCR and got slaughtered for their trouble.
AID00120030	Lot of us got killed at Bitter Springs. Lot of them, I mean. My parents died, too.
AID00120031	What happened to your parents?
AID00120032	They're dead. Got themselves killed at Bitter Springs. Served them right, if you ask me.
AID00120033	I didn't mean to offend. You don't have to tell me, if you'd rather not.
AID00120034	[SUCCEEDED] It's a Khan name. You know... the "Great Khans." That's what my parents were.
AID00120035	I figured I grew up around the bastards... they owed me a name, after all they put me through.
AID00120036	Bitter-Root. You have an unusual name.
AID00120037	You trying to start trouble? Or do you really not know where I got that name?
AID00120038	How long have you been with the First Recon?
AID00120039	A while, I guess. I don't keep too careful track of time.
AID00120040	I like to keep things simple. Just focus on now. That's why they made me a sniper.
AID00120041	You let your mind wander back a ways, and you lose sight of what's in front of your eyes. Good way to miss a mark.
AID00120042	Your father is your commanding officer? Is that allowed?
AID00120043	Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me, for a while.
AID00120044	It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
AID00120045	It's like I told you. Dhatri's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
AID00120046	Where can I find some work around here?
AID00120047	You a merc? Then I guess you'd want to talk to my, uh... father. Major Dhatri. He's our CO.
AID00120048	Not too friendly, are you?
AID00120049	Guess not. I don't mean nothing by it.
AID00120050	You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
AID00120051	Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
AID00120052	10 of Spades always had plenty to say, before he got himself killed. Me, I'm just here to do my job.
AID00120053	I don't really agree with you, but I'm not interested in moving drugs for you.
AID00120054	Fine, piss off then. I thought we had a good thing going here, but it looks like you're just a goody-goody.
AID00120055	Yeah, I agree about the alcohol.
AID00120056	The law is the law.  I'm done doing business with you.
AID00120057	Now see, that's just downright unfriendly of you. I can't just let you go shooting your mouth off to Boyd now can I?
AID00120058	Lying bastard.  I want cut in on this action.
AID00120059	You're one pushy son of a bitch, I'll give you that. Alright, here are some caps to keep your mouth shut.
AID00120060	There is a lot of money to be made, and I'm not afraid to share it with reliable folks. Just keep the busters out of this and we're good.
AID00120061	So you've got the package then? I need to get that sorted and then sent off in a few days.
AID00120062	Bullshit.  If you're moving drugs, I'm going to have to report you.
AID00120063	Whoa there, kiddo. No need to blow things out of proportion. I'm just selling certain ingredients on the side, not chems.
AID00120064	Besides, it's not like drugs are a big deal. Alcohol is just as bad yet it is perfectly legal in the NCR. I'm just a businessman doing business.
AID00120065	All right.  I guess I believe you.
AID00120066	Good. Does that mean you have those supplies?
AID00120067	Hey, these medical supplies look like chem ingredients.
AID00120068	Really? I never noticed that. I'm just following orders here, moving supplies as needed.
AID00120069	VMS08MonorailRecording
AID00120070	The tram is about to depart. Please keep clear of the doors, and restrain any young children.
AID00120071	VMS08CurtisAmbush
AID00120072	You're getting too close, shamus!
AID00120073	This is where your trail runs cold.
AID00120074	Goodbye.
AID00120075	Hey, yeah. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be rolling in a shitload of caps, right?
AID00120076	You've worked a lot of different trades?
AID00120077	Oh, yeah. A lot. Like, before I was a bounty hunter, I worked as a caravan guard. You'd think that was a cakewalk, right? Wrong.
AID00120078	Crazy bastards expected me to wake up at dawn. Forget it. That's about two hours after this guy hits the sack.
AID00120079	And I need at least ten, twelve hours of sleep to do my job. Price of excellence.
AID00120080	How long have you been a bounty hunter?
AID00120081	Oh, shit, I don't know.  Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
AID00120082	What are you going to do now?
AID00120083	Simple. I'm going to make myself some easy money. I got a plan.
AID00120084	Once I get my caps from Dhatri, I'm going to head on over to Gomorrah and win big at cards.
AID00120085	There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out.
AID00120086	No. Never heard of them.
AID00120087	'Course you didn't. 'Cause they crossed paths with Little Buster. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
AID00120088	I take it they were Fiends?
AID00120089	Damn right they were. And they were good, too. 'Til I popped a couple shells in their assholes. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
AID00120090	See, somebody gives me a job, I do it. Maybe I complain a little, here and there, but my shit gets done.
AID00120091	Why does Dhatri owe you caps?
AID00120092	Because I killed a couple marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
AID00120093	Major Dhatri said I should ask you about Cook-Cook.
AID00120094	The rapist with the flamethrower? Yeah, that's a combination I stay the fuck away from.
AID00120095	I was stalking him for a while. I'm real good at that. Watching people from where they can't see me, you know?
AID00120096	Only one thing I learned about that asshole. He keeps a bunch of Brahmins. Most of them he roasts whenever he feels like it, but there's one...
AID00120097	...must be his pet, or some shit. Doesn't let anybody near that Brahmin. Somebody puts a bullet in her, I bet that'd piss him off good.
AID00120098	Might make him careless, too.
AID00120099	Why did you quit the trade?
AID00120100	See, I thought the bounty hunting trade would be easy money, but it turns out it's hard work. So screw it.
AID00120101	Also - I ran into this mark who was a little too tough for me. I mean, I could've taken him.
AID00120102	But with this guy, it might have cost me some bad burns or an ass-rape. I'm all for risking my life, but I'm a little sensitive about my asshole.
AID00120103	I've been known to hunt a few bounties, myself.
AID00120104	Well hey, the field's wide open, now that I'm gone. Probably lots of people looking to get in, once they hear I quit.
AID00120105	Are you supposed to be famous or something?
AID00120106	Well shit, feel free to stick a knife in the old ego. I thought I'd made a name for myself around here.
AID00120107	Guess that's as good a reason as any to quit this stinkin' trade. No glory. No easy money, no women, and no glory.
AID00120108	Shit, I'd settle just for the women.
AID00120109	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
AID00120110	I'll take a look, just to see what sort of shit they were into.
AID00120111	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
AID00120112	I've seen enough. You did everyone a service. Take these. Might help if you get a jam.
AID00120113	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
AID00120114	We'll see how it goes.
AID00120115	That's right, we will. Anything I can help you with?
AID00120116	We'll see how it goes.
AID00120117	Fine by me.
AID00120118	So long as we understand each other.
AID00120119	Fine by me.
AID00120120	I'd like to hear about your open bounties.
AID00120121	Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
AID00120122	I got a little turned around. Where can I find your boss?
AID00120123	Let me ask you something else.
AID00120124	Do you ever quit? Go on.
AID00120125	I'm not sure how much I can help. But I have another question.
AID00120126	Your talking slows my healing process. Be snappy about it.
AID00120127	FiendMotorRunner3
AID00120128	Like anyone in their right mind would follow you.
AID00120129	Yeah, you do that.
AID00120130	FiendMotorRunner2
AID00120131	Yeah. Can't say I'm sad to hear he's gone. I should take over.
AID00120132	Must have been some NCR. I know they've been gunning for him.
AID00120133	FiendMotorRunner1
AID00120134	Damn, are you serious? He was one tough son of a bitch.
AID00120135	Good, I hated that fucker.
AID00120136	Can you make it worth my while?
AID00120137	I don't know. Carter told me about some password he hacked out of a computer. I could give it to you, if you help us out.
AID00120138	I have a couple more questions.
AID00120139	Okay, but be quiet. I don't want the Fiends to hear us.
AID00120140	Give me the password he found, and I'll help you escape.
AID00120141	[FAILED] Help us first, then we'll give you the password, and don't think about killing me. Its all in my head.
AID00120142	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, it isn't like it is doing me any good in here. You'd better come back though.
AID00120143	<Intimidate> Give me the password or you're all going to die in here.
AID00120144	If I help you escape, will you give me the password he found?
AID00120145	Yeah, it is yours if you help us out of here.
AID00120146	I object to the use of violence against prisoners of war.
AID00120147	Aw, tear my heart out, why don't you? Well, maybe you can find a way to play with his mind - get him out of his comfort zone.
AID00120148	People lose their heads and say things they regret. Especially if they underestimate you. This dickhead would underestimate a nuclear missile.
AID00120149	Plenty of ways to skin a cat, as they say. Hey, what if we skinned him? Bet he wouldn't be so smug then.
AID00120150	He admitted to manufacturing and selling chems.
AID00120151	He's trafficking chems? I don't know how he thought he could get away with that.
AID00120152	I hacked into his computer and found evidence that he's selling NCR guns.
AID00120153	Little bastard. I'm sure some of those find their way into the hands of our enemies, too.
AID00120154	I have proof that Sgt. Contreras is involved in criminal activity.
AID00120155	That may be the worst-kept secret on the base. I'd be more surprised if you had proof he wasn't involved in criminal activity.
AID00120156	But if you have proof, you're the envy of every MP stationed here. What'd you find?
AID00120157	All right. Thanks for telling me. I'm going to have him rounded up.
AID00120158	Pretty impressive work there. Wish I could keep you around.
AID00120159	But for helping me nail this guy, I think you should have a little keepsake.
AID00120160	Here. It's not contraband, but I confiscated it from Contreras last week because he was being smarmy and I was sick of his bullshit.
AID00120161	No, nothing else.
AID00120162	Well, that's a shame about Corporal White. He knew better than that.
AID00120163	He wants you to increase water flow to Freeside. Said it'd be lost otherwise.
AID00120164	Man, that guy's got water on the brain. Knows more about water pipes than any man should.
AID00120165	If he says we're losing water, I think the colonel would listen to that. I'll talk to him about it.
AID00120166	Never mind.
AID00120167	Okay, well let me know if you find out anything.
AID00120168	A gang called the Scorpions murdered him. A man named Anderson witnessed it.
AID00120169	Shit. That's why you don't go wandering off looking for some call girl on the Strip without telling somebody first.
AID00120170	Anderson. Is that Followers of the Apocalypse Anderson?
AID00120171	He was killed by a man named Anderson he caught stealing water from the NCR.
AID00120172	Anderson. I've heard of him, if it's the same guy. Water nerd from the Followers of the Apocalypse. Used to handle some of the operations for OSI.
AID00120173	I don't know what to think about the Followers. The things they do... hard to say if they're helping or hurting sometimes. Especially in Freeside.
AID00120174	I'll have to send some people out there to make sure we don't lose any more water. That stuff's like gold out here.
AID00120175	But you. I owe you for this. You saved me a lot of work. And I'm sure Corporal White's family will be grateful to at least get some closure.
AID00120176	The MPs keep a bunch of junk around that's confiscated off of people who decide to screw with us.
AID00120177	I haven't really sorted through it, but go ahead and see if there's anything you can use in there.
AID00120178	We keep it in a trunk across the hall, by the prison cells.
AID00120179	I have an update on Corporal White.
AID00120180	I've already talked to Anderson, actually. Came in, confessed, and gave you credit for the whole thing.
AID00120181	First time I've ever seen anything like that. Was like you'd done him some huge favor. I've gotta hand it to you.
AID00120182	This Dazzle must be some girl.
AID00120183	Don't tell me. He married the hooker.
AID00120184	Isaac has me out looking for metal so they can do the first shipment.
AID00120185	Well what the hell are you doing here? Get your ass out and find that metal.  Don't come back until the job is done!
AID00120186	No one works for Price, so who the hell are you?
AID00120187	Ah, shit. Well since you seem to have things figured out, the name's Keller. I'm an NCR Ranger investigating chem runners.
AID00120188	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
AID00120189	What's your business with him?
AID00120190	<Draw weapon> You're a dead man.
AID00120191	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, buddy...
AID00120192	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, lady...
AID00120193	Has your research here turned up anything interesting?
AID00120194	A few things here and there, but a lot of the data has been corrupted, and all of the live samples have been contaminated by the spore plants.
AID00120195	One interesting thing I found is that one of the chemicals secreted by the spore plants serves as a mild stimulant when ingested by humans.
AID00120196	As far as I can tell, it has no side effects or addictive properties, aside from the inherent psychological ones, of course.
AID00120197	Now that I think of it, there was a Cpl. Farber back at McCarran who'd probably be interested in it. There's a sample of it around here somewhere.

AID00120199	Move it!  Move it!  Move it!  Get those legs up you sorry bastards!
AID00120200	Move, you lazy bastards! Do you think the legion is going to slow down for your sorry asses?!
AID00120201	Quit dragging your feet, recruit. Pick it up!
AID00120202	You run like a feeble old man, private!
AID00120203	You can rest when you're dead, private! Move your ass!
AID00120204	How the hell did you make it through boot camp, private?!
AID00120205	You think it burns now, wait until I sit on your shoulders!
AID00120206	The road to hell is paved by the bleached bones of privates that fell by the wayside, boys.
AID00120207	Pathetic! My 80-year-old grandmother runs faster than you!
AID00120208	Good thing you're not a ranger. When a ranger quits he's dead!
AID00120209	Sound off like you've got a pair!
AID00120210	That's better, but you're still not winning the battle, boys.
AID00120211	I'm looking for work.
AID00120212	Well, I know Major Dhatri is offering bounties on some of the Fiends - that's the gang that controls the southeast part of the city.
AID00120213	You can find the major at the camp just outside of the old airport.
AID00120214	Not sure how to help you with that one. Major Dhatri was offering bounties on some of the Fiends, but I hear someone took care of that recently.
AID00120215	Are these files valuable?
AID00120216	To someone, I'm sure. But they constitute a threat to life as we know it. Now give me your arm already.
AID00120217	Fine, do it.
AID00120218	I did download some files earlier while exploring the vault.
AID00120219	Those files need to be erased. Hold out your arm and I'll have it done in a flash.
AID00120220	What was the name of the Fiend who was carrying keys?
AID00120221	Daniel. Probably find him back in the Residential Wing somewhere.

AID00120228	Warning! Primary defensive objective, designation Keely, taken by unknown hostile entities. Initiating full countermeasures.
AID00120229	What are you doing here?
AID00120230	I am assisting my master Keely with her research. We have been tasked with extracting as much of the research that was performed here as possible.
AID00120231	What can you tell me about this place?
AID00120232	Very little, I'm afraid. I've been stuck here calculating protein sequences for most of our sojourn here thus far.
AID00120233	Master Keely has done most of the exploring. She might be able to tell you more.
AID00120234	Why don't you go and look for her?
AID00120235	I have been given explicit instructions to stay here until the master returns.
AID00120236	Perhaps. I'll go down and look for her.
AID00120237	Oh, thank you! The master can really be a bother sometimes, but she has a good heart.
AID00120238	Now, I must get back to computing protein sequences. Please tell the master to hurry back if you see her.
AID00120239	Not really. Is your master around?
AID00120240	I've been sent to look for her. Where is she now?
AID00120241	Where is Keely now?
AID00120242	I couldn't say, exactly. She went down to the lower levels some time ago and hasn't been back since. Do you suppose something has happened to her?
AID00120243	I don't have time to talk, sorry.
AID00120244	Very well, I'll get back to computing these protein sequences, then. Farewell.
AID00120245	Have you seen a ghoul named Keely around here?
AID00120246	Why yes, the master was here some time ago. Do you have business with her?
AID00120247	Skip the introductions. Why are you here?
AID00120248	My, how rude. If you must know, I am here to assist my master Keely in her research.
AID00120249	Nice to meet you.
AID00120250	A pleasure to meet you, sir. What may I do for you?
AID00120251	A pleasure to meet you, madam. What may I do for you?
AID00120252	Goodbye.
AID00120253	Goobye!
AID00120254	Do you have trouble speaking?
AID00120255	Mmm-hm. [Points to stump of tongue in his mouth.]

AID00120267	Get your ass up.
AID00120268	What the-
AID00120269	Nothing today. Goodbye.
AID00120270	I could ask you the same question.
AID00120271	See those menacing looking troopers with guns standing on the walls up there? That's Bravo Company. My company.
AID00120272	Since Oliver stuck me in a desk job, I hardly ever get to see them during the day. So sometimes I like to check up on them when they have night duty.
AID00120273	But you still haven't answered my question.
AID00120274	I got lost. This place is so big.
AID00120275	[FAILED] Lost, huh? If you say so. If you head over to the front terminal building you should be able to get in through the garage doors in back.
AID00120276	I'm headed that way, myself, actually, so you can just follow me if you need to.
AID00120277	Nothing.
AID00120278	Be straight with me. If you're onto something, I want to know about it.
AID00120279	If you were to get caught or killed, we'd lose everything you've learned about this case.
AID00120280	I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
AID00120281	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I get insomnia pretty bad myself, out here. I think it's the heat. Weird how sometimes it's cooler out here than it is inside.
AID00120282	Well, I hope you manage to get some rest. Take it easy.
AID00120283	I'm here to buy out Cassidy Caravans for the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00120284	Okay! Sold!
AID00120285	Goodbye.
AID00120286	Bye.
AID00120287	
AID00120288	
AID00120289	
AID00120290	Yeah, yeah. This isn't rocket science. Watch and learn.
AID00120291	Understood. Thanks for the help.
AID00120292	Least we can do. Wish we could help more.
AID00120293	I'll take my chances.
AID00120294	Hey, it's your life.
AID00120295	Actually I'm supposed to be getting a body out of there.
AID00120296	Out of my way.
AID00120297	I'm going to take this basket of cakes to my grandmother's house.
AID00120298	All right, smartass, I get it. You don't answer to us. But get this straight. You will get eaten alive if you go up that way.
AID00120299	And that's not a figure of speech, either. Bunch of sick, messed-up junkies control the road up there. Got a thing for desecrating corpses.
AID00120300	You've been warned.
AID00120301	Just passing through.
AID00120302	I wouldn't do that if I were you. Those buildings up ahead are crawling with psychos. This is as far up as we've been able to safely set up a position.
AID00120303	You go any further, we can't protect you, understand?
AID00120304	I'm going to retrieve the body of Ranger Morales.
AID00120305	Christina hired you, huh? Well, if you're going to go up there, there's a couple things you should know.
AID00120306	Esteban's body is in the middle of those buildings up the hill there. Look carefully, and you can see the Fiends patrolling the rooftops.
AID00120307	But they laid traps, too. There's mines all over. So for godsakes, watch your feet. Get him back here. We'll get him home.
AID00120308	NVTempMusic
AID00120309	How might I be of assistance?
AID00120310	Oh, so many ways! Small ones to begin with, so we can get used to what it's like to have a sav- outsider around and about.
AID00120311	Should that go well, it may be you can help in big ways, too. We'll have to see.
AID00120312	<Science check to get emitter>
AID00120313	[SUCCEEDED] Hot damn, you're right! It's a matter of boosting across those thresholds, not exact amplitude. You're smarter than you look.
AID00120314	Just so happens I was testing it at 24,000 hertz, so it should be good to go. Place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
AID00120315	Signal's too high for people to hear, so no harm done, but it might make you feel sick to your stomach.
AID00120316	Any signal over 22,000 hertz at 150 or more decibels should do the trick.
AID00120317	[FAILED] No, it doesn't have a dial! It has to be stabilized for an exact frequency or it could shake itself apart!
AID00120318	Oh. Does it have a dial or something? Turn it up to 11!
AID00120319	Raquel said you were working on some kind of weapon to fight the giant ants?
AID00120320	I started building a sonic emitter that might do the trick, but it's useless without knowing the exact frequency that would kill the ants.
AID00120321	I'd like to know all about your people.
AID00120322	Wonderful! I'm sure you've noticed the mural on the wall of this hut. Shall I tell you what it all means?
AID00120323	Ask away.
AID00120324	I have some questions about your people's history.
AID00120325	Anything else you want to know?
AID00120326	Other questions you want to ask?
AID00120327	What else I can tell you?
AID00120328	I wish everyone were just as interested in our story as you are! Maybe I should act out the battles or learn how to throw my voice...
AID00120329	Who are you?
AID00120330	Me? I'm Pete, Keeper of the Story.
AID00120331	I know I seem kind of young. I was the apprentice Keeper of the Story until a couple months ago, but ol' Keeper Don, well...
AID00120332	Whiskey and land mines don't go together. So it's up to me. I bet you want to know everything about us!
AID00120333	I'm looking for ways to make myself useful.
AID00120334	If that's so, how about you look into repairing the solar arrays on the roof of the generator building?
AID00120335	Nothing too complicated about it, but it's a long ways to walk my old bones, and there's been that ant problem over near there.
AID00120336	You can't miss the array. It's on top of the generator building smack dab in the middle of Nellis between the two runways.
AID00120337	Thanks for the warning, but I'm leaving.
AID00120338	Is there a way to get past?
AID00120339	There is a way, and I'll tell you... for a little wager?
AID00120340	300 caps? Nah, I've got better things to spend my caps on.
AID00120341	Suit yourself. Come back and see me when you get tired of picking shrapnel out of your backside.
AID00120342	Thanks for the warning. What's going on past those signs?
AID00120343	Oh lordy lordy, you haven't heard of the Boomers? What rock have you been living under?
AID00120344	They're a bunch of artillery-slingin' grenade lobbin' odd-jobs camping out in Nellis. Wander into their territory and you're as good as mincemeat!
AID00120345	Simple enough. Run, hide, run. It's all in the timing.
AID00120346	But I had you zeroed in the whole time! Nobody's that fast!
AID00120347	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
AID00120348	I'm still trying to figure out who to help and how.
AID00120349	Each of the elders would appreciate assistance with various issues here in Nellis.
AID00120350	Seek out Jack, Loyal, Raquel, and Argyll. They will guide you.
AID00120351	Loyal still needs help getting the plane back to Nellis, and there may be others who still require assistance.
AID00120352	You tell me. What do people have to say about me?
AID00120353	I haven't heard anything. You must not be trying hard enough.
AID00120354	I may have heard a compliment or two. Nothing special.
AID00120355	I do believe you've convinced one or two of us that it's better you made it here than were blown to smithereens.
AID00120356	More and more, I hear my people saying good things about you.
AID00120357	I believe the time has come for you to show your value in full. The people have come to accept having you around.
AID00120358	Find Loyal and ask him about our people's fondest dream. He will tell you what to do next.
AID00120359	Well, I think. I've done everything I can to help out.
AID00120360	The ballast worked. The B-29 is at the surface, ready to go.
AID00120361	What you have done for us is a miracle, child. You have fulfilled the only dreams we ever had outside our walls.
AID00120362	You are a trusted friend of us all. If there is ever a way for us to help you, child, tell me and I will make it so.
AID00120363	I've spoken to Loyal. The B-29 is on the way.
AID00120364	Extraordinary, child. Go tell Loyal, then return to me.
AID00120365	Goodbye.
AID00120366	See you later!
AID00120367	I didn't run through all that artillery to hear your stupid questions.
AID00120368	Are you even human? Some kind of mutant?
AID00120369	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
AID00120370	Who's in charge here?
AID00120371	I'm not telling you a thing, savage!
AID00120372	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
AID00120373	Goodbye.
AID00120374	Goodbye.
AID00120375	Your plan worked. The plane floated up. Seemed to be intact.
AID00120376	That's tremendous! I'll transmit instructions to the robots to start packing up the plane to bring it back to Nellis!
AID00120377	Tell me again what I need to do.
AID00120378	I wish you'd paid attention the first time! All you need to do is attach the deployable ballast to the plane.
AID00120379	Some of my robots will carry a remote activation station out to the shore. Attach the ballast, hit a button, and they'll handle the rest.
AID00120380	Where is the bomber located?
AID00120381	I told you, at the bottom of Lake Mead! I'll make sure the location is displayed on your Pip-boy map.
AID00120382	How do you expect to raise a bomber from the bottom of a lake?
AID00120383	Simple! Attach deployable ballast to the plane and float it on up!
AID00120384	Here is a remote detonator. Once the ballast is attached to the plane just hit the detonator from the shore and let buoyancy handle the rest.
AID00120385	Where is the bomber located?
AID00120386	It's at the bottom of Lake Mead. I'll mark its location on your Pip-boy map.
AID00120387	Lady in the water? What's that?
AID00120388	A long time ago - long before the war that killed just about everything that ever lived - a bomber crashed not far from here.
AID00120389	A bomber was a flying contraption that could drop explosives down on anything it flew over. But anyway, moving on...
AID00120390	This bomber crashed down in Lake Mead, pretty damn near intact. When we got to Nellis, see, I found this article in a magazine all about it.
AID00120391	There was another B-29 around here, part of a museum. Couldn't fly, but had a lot of spare parts, see? Get where I'm going?
AID00120392	Since I was a young man, I've dreamed of raising that Lady from the lake and bringing her back to life. What do you say?
AID00120393	That's all for now.
AID00120394	Thanks for dropping it off. Anything else?
AID00120395	Just take all of it.
AID00120396	Hey thanks!
AID00120397	Just 1.
AID00120398	Thanks.
AID00120399	I've got scrap metal for you.
AID00120400	Cool! How much can you spare?
AID00120401	I'll look into it. Stranger things have happened.
AID00120402	That would be amazing. As in, I would thank you forever.
AID00120403	Maybe I could talk to her for you. What's she look like?
AID00120404	Oh, you can't miss her! She has short red hair and she's the most beautiful woman who ever lived!
AID00120405	You'd really talk to her for me? What if she feels the same way? What if she comes here like you did?
AID00120406	What if she gets blown up? What if she doesn't like me?
AID00120407	Oh jeez, I better just let you handle it. I'm better with machines. They don't make my stomach queasy like this!
AID00120408	Oh, you can't miss her! She has short red hair and she's the most beautiful woman who ever lived!
AID00120409	You'd really talk to her for me? What if she feels the same way? What if she comes here like you did?
AID00120410	What if she gets blown up? What if she doesn't like me?
AID00120411	Oh jeez, I better just let you handle it. I'm better with machines. They don't make my stomach queasy like this!
AID00120412	What can you tell me about Loyal?
AID00120413	Loyal's a great man, but he's getting on in years, so a younger's got to learn everything he knows. That'd be me.
AID00120414	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
AID00120415	If you help him recover the Lady I figure - oh, I figure it's been a nice day. Yeah, a real nice day.
AID00120416	Loyal's a great man, but he's getting on in years, so a younger's got to learn everything he knows. That'd be me.
AID00120417	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
AID00120418	Oh come on, you've met Loyal by now. He's a mechanical genius.
AID00120419	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
AID00120420	Goodbye.
AID00120421	All right. See you around, I hope.
AID00120422	This doesn't interest me.
AID00120423	Then why did you make me spill my guts about it? You're an asshole!
AID00120424	So tell me about this girl that caught your interest.
AID00120425	There's an outpost near here. The signs say "Crimson Caravan?" It seems like they carry things to and fro for people out there?
AID00120426	Well, every once in a while I watch the outpost through one of the spotters' binoculars. And sometimes there's this girl there, this special girl...
AID00120427	And sometimes it's like she's watching me back with her binoculars! Except she's probably just watching Nellis. I haven't tried waving.
AID00120428	<Speech>
AID00120429	[FAILED] I'll keep my spit to myself, thank you very much. That sounded stupid, didn't it? Damn it.
AID00120430	"Personal matter?" Nonsense. Spit it out.
AID00120431	[SUCCEEDED] That must be nice, sharing yourself like that, not being embarrassed or anything? Well, the thing is, there's this girl...
AID00120432	Where I come from, we discuss personal matters all the time.
AID00120433	I can find you some scrap metal.
AID00120434	Thanks. That'd be great.
AID00120435	What do you do here?
AID00120436	Me? I work with Loyal, mostly electronics work and robotics. Keeping the old technologies alive, right?
AID00120437	I'm looking for ways to help out. Anything come to mind?
AID00120438	What I could use is some scrap metal. It may not sound exciting, but around here we have to recycle every rivet and plate.
AID00120439	The other thing, you being from the outside and all, well, I guess you'd call it a personal matter but, well... Eh, forget it!
AID00120440	Like I said, I can never get enough scrap metal.
AID00120441	Can you think of any ways I can help out?
AID00120442	Loyal said you can help me breathe under water.
AID00120443	I just need some parts from a pressure cooker to create a hermetic seal for the rebreather.
AID00120444	Have you found a pressure cooker so I can finish the rebreather?
AID00120445	Goodbye.
AID00120446	Goodbye.
AID00120447	< Speech - 30 >
AID00120448	[SUCCEEDED] The truth of it is that I did cut out a raider's heart, but only took a bite to mess with his buddies.
AID00120449	They had me surrounded and I went with the first thing that came to mind. Some ran, and the rest were startled just long enough.
AID00120450	It sounds like there's an interesting story behind it.
AID00120451	[FAILED] Nope. You'll just have to keep on wondering. Heh.
AID00120452	Come on, you can tell me.
AID00120453	You served in the military?
AID00120454	Err... yeah. It was a long time ago. Things were better back then.
AID00120455	Who's Sergeant Dornan?
AID00120456	He was a drill instructor I knew. He was also the meanest bastard I've ever known.
AID00120457	Once, he caught this private out of uniform and old Dornan went off on the most ear-blistering rant known to man. It was inspiring.
AID00120458	You sound like you're eager to die.
AID00120459	There's a twitch in my trigger finger, I've lost my eagle eyes, and the other day I could've sworn I heard Sergeant Dornan chewing me out.
AID00120460	I'm old and I'm starting to feel it. It's not pleasant, especially when you know your mind's slipping away.
AID00120461	We all gotta go sometime, but I was hoping for something a little more heroic.
AID00120462	How much money do you owe this Reaper guy?
AID00120463	What? I was talking about Death, kid. Guess that one went right over your head, didn't it? Old Sergeant Dornan would've had a field day with you.
AID00120464	You were expecting someone else?
AID00120465	"Oh?"
AID00120466	I've been in the Reaper's shadow for a long time now, and I thought he'd finally showed up to collect. He's just mocking me now.
AID00120467	I've been inside Nellis. There's a young man there who has a crush on you.
AID00120468	Nice-looking blonde boy? I always wondered if he was watching me back! What's he like?
AID00120469	No reason. I'll be off now.
AID00120470	Alright then, goodbye.
AID00120471	Goodbye.
AID00120472	Bye.
AID00120473	I don't suppose you watch the Boomers over in Nellis sometimes, do you?
AID00120474	I watch all sorts of things with my binoculars. Who wants to know, and why?
AID00120475	I'm looking for a redheaded girl around here.
AID00120476	
AID00120477	Do you know any redheads in these parts?
AID00120478	I'm looking for a redhead girl, do you know any around here?
AID00120479	I can spare 4 more.
AID00120480	I can spare another.
AID00120481	SSHQFestusGoodbye
AID00120482	Sorry to see you go so soon. Be sure to drink a Sunset Sarsaparilla for me!
AID00120483	Goodbye.
AID00120484	SSHQFestusCompanyInfo
AID00120485	SSHQFestusStarPower
AID00120486	SSHQFestusAdvisory
AID00120487	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
AID00120488	Silly Ol' Advisory.
AID00120489	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
AID00120490	Silly Ol' Advisory.
AID00120491	While Sunset Sarsaparilla is perfectly safe, a recent independent study - whose validity is currently being challenged - revealed the following:
AID00120492	Excessive ingestion of sarsaparilla can lead to deleterious effects including, but not limited to:
AID00120493	kidney damage,
AID00120494	nausea,
AID00120495	digital numbness,
AID00120496	anxiety,
AID00120497	loss of visual acuity,
AID00120498	dizziness,
AID00120499	occasional nosebleeds,
AID00120500	joint inflammation,
AID00120501	tooth decay,
AID00120502	sore throat,
AID00120503	bronchitis,
AID00120504	organ rupture,
AID00120505	and halitosis.
AID00120506	Note that you'd have to drink a heap of Sunset Sarsaparilla to match the quantities used in the study. How much, you ask?
AID00120507	A lot. A whole helluva lot. In fact, you'd have to get full as a tick on Sunset Sarsaparilla to even come close.
AID00120508	Anyway, thanks for stopping by, partner! And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
AID00120509	Silly Ol' Advisory.
AID00120510	Not yet, but I hope to very soon.
AID00120511	Okay, I'll be around.
AID00120512	I got a Boomer uniform for you to wear while you cross to Nellis.
AID00120513	Well, with McLafferty dead, I guess my contract is done and I'm free to leave. I'm off to meet my admirer!
AID00120514	There's one more thing. I have a work contract with the Crimson Caravan, and if I walk away, I lose the wages they owe me.
AID00120515	Could you do just one more thing for me and talk to Alice McLafferty about it? I know if I do it, she'll just say no. I'd hate to lose the money.
AID00120516	He's doing well. I'll come back when I have some more information.
AID00120517	Ok, talk to you soon.
AID00120518	Actually, I wanted to talk to you about him again.
AID00120519	I was hoping you would. What's going on?
AID00120520	I was hoping you would. What's going on? Have they agreed to my safety yet?
AID00120521	I doubt it.
AID00120522	Just my luck. I finally find the perfect guy, and he's a Boomer.
AID00120523	I'll ask Pearl to make an exception for you.
AID00120524	This is so exciting! Let me know how it turns out.
AID00120525	I'm not sure. Let me think about it and I'll come back to you.
AID00120526	Ok, let me know when you have an idea.
AID00120527	<Lie> You have permission. They know you're coming.
AID00120528	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Thank you so much! I'll get going right away.
AID00120529	[FAILED] Are you trying to get me killed? No way I'm going in there.
AID00120530	<Lie> Just wave your arms and run as fast as you can.
AID00120531	Let me see if I can get you safe passage past the artillery.
AID00120532	He's a special sort of guy - perfect for a special sort of gal.
AID00120533	Ooh, I've just got to meet him! Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
AID00120534	He's a catch. You should see him blush when I flirt with him.
AID00120535	Well, you don't have to do that anymore! Sounds like I better hurry to him.
AID00120536	Any chance the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
AID00120537	He's nice, maybe a little naive. Seems convinced you're the love of his life.
AID00120538	Really? That's so sweet!
AID00120539	I'd love to go meet him. Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
AID00120540	VCG00OpeningSequence
AID00120541	Is that thing silver?
AID00120542	You're not getting paid to run your mouth.
AID00120543	So far you ain't paid us nothing!
AID00120544	You'll get your caps when the job's done!
AID00120545	Is this deep enough?
AID00120546	Yeah. Take that thing off.
AID00120547	Real shame you got caught up in this, kid. Must seem like bad luck.
AID00120548	Truth is, game was rigged from the start.
AID00120549	That the thing you were talking about?
AID00120550	Beautiful, ain't it? It's platinum.
AID00120551	Can't see shit out here.
AID00120552	Either way, you owe us.
AID00120553	I told you, you'll get paid when we get there.
AID00120554	We just walked through hell, man.
AID00120555	What are you, dense? I don't got it here!
AID00120556	Hey. What do you want me to do with this?
AID00120557	Almost forgot. Take off the hood.
AID00120558	Well, kid, you're our last loose end.
AID00120559	Shame you had to get caught in the middle of all this. Bet you don't even know why you're here.
AID00120560	But hey, if it makes you feel any better, it's nothing personal.
AID00120561	Just bad luck.
AID00120562	Well we're not going back north. We're lucky to be alive.
AID00120563	How the hell else are we supposed to get back, genius?
AID00120564	We go east. Take the 95.
AID00120565	East? Are you nuts? That'll take us days out of our way.
AID00120566	Then you can just go back by yourself.
AID00120567	Fine. Anything to get you two to shut up.
AID00120568	I'll take it.
AID00120569	Never mind.
AID00120570	Have you talked to your superior officer?
AID00120571	How are you going to get rid of her?
AID00120572	What are you going to do about Harcourt?
AID00120573	Or she's just lucky.
AID00120574	I could take of Harcourt. What are you offering?
AID00120575	I think you're overreacting.
AID00120576	Is that going happen soon? I'd like to be around to loot your corpses.
AID00120577	What are you talking about?
AID00120578	Goodbye.
AID00120579	I'm sure the casinos of New Vegas love you.
AID00120580	You put on a brave face, but I can tell that it bothers you, just a bit.
AID00120581	That has to bother you, right?
AID00120582	Why do the other soldiers think you're a jinx?
AID00120583	I take it you're some kind of jinx?
AID00120584	Uh, what?
AID00120585	Right. Biggs mentioned you.
AID00120586	I win more than my fair share of coin tosses. How is that a bad thing?
AID00120587	Goodbye.
AID00120588	I think a man would be very lucky indeed to catch you.
AID00120589	
AID00120590	Of course it would. I'll have you set up with some quarters with some of the other women.
AID00120591	
AID00120592	And you're even more handsome up close. Do you think it'll be okay if I hang around here for a little while, so we can get to know each other better?
AID00120593	
AID00120594	I'm glad that you made it out here. You're even more stunning up close than you were at a distance.
AID00120595	
AID00120596	Hi there, it is great to meet you as well.
AID00120597	Let's talk about something else
AID00120598	Okay.
AID00120599	VCG00Rescue
AID00120600	Howdy, pardner! Fine evening, ain't it?
AID00120601	Friend, you look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
AID00120602	Howdy, pardner! Sure is one fine evening, ain't it?
AID00120603	Gimme your hand, pardner. Let's get you out of there.
AID00120604	You okay, pardner? You look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
AID00120605	So what do you do now that the fighting's died down?
AID00120606	Mostly drill the troops, try to keep the discipline up and combat readiness high.
AID00120607	It's not the easiest job in the world - soldiers without a mission get bored very easily.
AID00120608	Still, with the Legion just across the river, we have to be ready.
AID00120609	Funny, I thought this was where they sent washouts and losers.
AID00120610	Yeah, well, somebody has to wrangle those washouts and losers. Somebody's got to turn them into a real fighting force.
AID00120611	That's some dedication.
AID00120612	Thanks. I only wish some of the soldiers under my command would share some of it.
AID00120613	You joined at 16 and you're still a sergeant?
AID00120614	Yeah, well... I didn't want to get promoted out of the field. I didn't join up to drive a desk.
AID00120615	Well, maybe if you tried to lead by example instead of tearing them down.
AID00120616	[SUCCEEDED] You really think so? Hell, I guess it's worth a shot.
AID00120617	[FAILED] Yeah, right. You think Poindexter doesn't have a dozen of his crazy practical jokes all lined up if I try that?
AID00120618	I like my underwear to *not* be full of radioactive itching powder, thanks.
AID00120619	This place doesn't seem so bad.
AID00120620	Please. Camp Golf is where they shuffle off anybody they don't want any more. Assignment here is a career ender.
AID00120621	How come you didn't make it into the Rangers?
AID00120622	Gee, I dunno, maybe because I'm saddled with the worst damn unit in the NCR Army? Think that might have something to do with it?
AID00120623	Sounds like you're a little disappointed in your troops.
AID00120624	Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no espirit de corps.
AID00120625	The squad leader's got some promise, kid named Mags, but as for the rest... I don't see much hope.
AID00120626	I'm going to make them shape up if it kills me, though. Or them, for that matter.
AID00120627	How'd you end up at Camp Golf?
AID00120628	I've been here since the first push into Vegas. Back in the day, this camp was the hotspot for conflicts with the Legion, raider tribes, you name it.
AID00120629	These days, I spend most of my time trying to beat a little discipline into the soldiers under my command. They've gotten soft with no action.
AID00120630	How do you like serving in the Army?
AID00120631	Man, it's my life. I joined up when I was 16 - I don't know how to do anything else.
AID00120632	Good news - Sgt. McCredie's canceled the combat patrol.
AID00120633	Sgt. McCredie asked me to talk to you about getting your squad in shape.
AID00120634	Thanks to you, I think we're in good shape. The squad seems to be functioning much better as a unit now.
AID00120635	How's the squad doing?
AID00120636	He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
AID00120637	Hoo-hoo! Hot damn, it's gonna be a party in the camp tonight!
AID00120638	I got you the stuff.
AID00120639	Yo, I'll tell you what this squad needs. A healthy dose of angry juice.
AID00120640	You actually did it? My friend, I am without doubt a genius, but I must say, you've given me a run for my money. Bravo. Bravo.
AID00120641	I think you'll find that the Misfits' records are now much improved.
AID00120642	That seems highly illogical. What reason would he have for doing that?
AID00120643	Boy, the squad sure is working together a lot better now! I think we're gonna be A-Okay!
AID00120644	How's that human niceness working out?
AID00120645	To me? Well, I'll tell you what I think this squad needs: a little more basic human niceness.
AID00120646	It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
AID00120647	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
AID00120648	It really, really didn't.
AID00120649	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
AID00120650	Not even a little bit, no.
AID00120651	So, did the grenade range practice take care of things?
AID00120652	Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
AID00120653	So, about those improvements....
AID00120654	Like I said, you get the juice, we'll cut loose.
AID00120655	About getting the squad's readiness reports up....
AID00120656	And what do you propose?
AID00120657	Going back to those squad improvements, I had an idea.
AID00120658	You did? Does that mean you're going to help?
AID00120659	I thought about what you said about basic human niceness.
AID00120660	Sounds like you aren't too fond of your squadmates.
AID00120661	Yeah. I mean, no, they're okay people, but they don't care, y'know? They don't have any ambition. No drive.
AID00120662	They're slacking off, and that reflects badly on me.
AID00120663	Tell me a little about yourself.
AID00120664	Not much to tell, really. I grew up in New Reno, joined up, took my shot at being a Ranger. Didn't make it, so I'm stuck with this crew of jokers.
AID00120665	How'd you end up assigned to Camp Golf?
AID00120666	Easy - this is where they send all the fuck-ups and people they don't want. But hey, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.
AID00120667	Why'd you join the Army?
AID00120668	I guess I wanted to make something of myself, you know? Be the best of the best. I *wanted* to be a ranger, but... guess this is as close as I get.
AID00120669	Know anything about your squadmates?
AID00120670	We don't talk too much, mostly. Poindexter's a smartass prick.
AID00120671	O'Hanrahan's a big pussy, ain't good for shit in a fight, and Mags... well, Mags is cut out for something other than soldiering, you dig?
AID00120672	So, what's your story?
AID00120673	Ain't much to tell. Grew up out west, in the Boneyard. Heard of it?
AID00120674	Yeah, not many people have. Wasn't really a good place for kids, you know? I joined up to get out. My family's still back there.
AID00120675	Can you tell me anything about Camp Golf?
AID00120676	What you want to know? Whole place used to be some kinda rich bastard resort, back before the war.
AID00120677	Now the Rangers use the old resort, and we grunts get to live in tents. Fucking typical.
AID00120678	Why are you in the Army?
AID00120679	Shit, man, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
AID00120680	At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
AID00120681	Shit, honey, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
AID00120682	At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
AID00120683	What do you think of Camp Golf?
AID00120684	Oh, it's a fine place. The lake is real pretty, and we don't get bothered much by them Legion fellers.
AID00120685	How'd you end up in the Army?
AID00120686	Well, as it turns out, we had a string of bad harvests a few years back. Pa said he couldn't afford to feed but three youngins, or we'd starve.
AID00120687	As the biggest one it was my job to go join the Army so's my sisters could eat and so's we wouldn't all be killed by raiders and Jesus would love us.
AID00120688	It's all right, I guess. I don't like all the fighting we gotta do, though.
AID00120689	Can you tell me about your squadmates?
AID00120690	They're mostly pretty nice - Poindexter showed me how to make fireworks! Razz kinda scares me sometimes, but I don't mind. He's had a hard life.
AID00120691	Why are you so afraid of fighting?
AID00120692	I ain't scared! I just don't like hurting folks, is all. Ma always used to tell me "boy, you're the biggest and the strongest, so you mind yourself!"
AID00120693	Every day she told me that. Guess I done took it to heart.
AID00120694	Tell me a little more about yourself.
AID00120695	Well, I was born on a farm out in California. Weren't much - me, Ma and Pa, my two sisters and about 40 acres of corn and brahmin.
AID00120696	Didn't never have no problems really, except for some lean years. Then I joined up and got shipped out here to New Vegas.
AID00120697	Tell me about yourself.
AID00120698	To what purpose? It's highly unlikely you'd understand anything I'd say.
AID00120699	Suffice to say I'm a certified genius, and when I'm discharged from this pit of testosterone and failure, I'll have all the money I could ever need.
AID00120700	Are you in charge around here?
AID00120701	In a strictly official capacity, no.
AID00120702	However, as I am by far the most intelligent and resourceful figure on this base, I feel it's safe to say the soldiers here look up to me.
AID00120703	How'd a guy like you end up in the Army?
AID00120704	It's a simple idea: the Army offers fiscal security and generous benefits at the cost of substantial personal risk - if you're on the front line.
AID00120705	If you perform too poorly, they'll scrub you out. Perform too well, and you get sent to the front lines.
AID00120706	All I have to do is ride that mediocrity gradient to a cushy, do-nothing job miles away from the war.
AID00120707	No.
AID00120708	I'll do what I can.
AID00120709	Goodbye.
AID00120710	What is this place?
AID00120711	You seem distressed.  Is something going on?
AID00120712	SSHQEyebotFlee
AID00120713	You appear to require assistance. I'll go find someone.
AID00120714	So the fact we're having this conversation means you failed, right?
AID00120715	I wasn't the one firing the howitzers. If you want to see how good I am at killing savages, I can show you.
AID00120716	Or you can accept Mother Pearl's invitation. It's your choice.
AID00120717	What's a Master-At-Arms?
AID00120718	I oversee the security of the Nellis homeland, from the coordination of its defenses to the training and fitness of its population.
AID00120719	All right. Lead the way.
AID00120720	Follow close - and mind your behavior.
AID00120721	Do you really think I'm scared of a punk like you?
AID00120722	Watch your mouth, savage! Raquel'll be here any second...
AID00120723	Can we move this along?
AID00120724	I said stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
AID00120725	I didn't come here to attack you.
AID00120726	Then just - just stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
AID00120727	VCG01DocReactions
AID00120728	Sorry, son. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. I guess I missed a spot.
AID00120729	Sorry, little lady. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. Guess I missed a spot.
AID00120730	Look at that. Maybe them bullets done your brain some good.
AID00120731	Now that don't make a lick of sense. Seems to me you're the luckiest son-of-a-gun in New Vegas.
AID00120732	With luck like yours I'm surprised them bullets didn't just turn right around and climb back into the gun.
AID00120733	That's some serious atrophy, even for someone who's been in bed awhile. It's a wonder you can move at all.
AID00120734	Surprised anybody'd want to tangle with you. Heck, you could go Deathclaw hunting with a switch.
AID00120735	I just don't get it. A stiff breeze'd tear you in two but a couple of bullets and you're right as rain.
AID00120736	I guess that explains how you're still alive. You're built solid as an oak.
AID00120737	Huh. Must be some frontal lobe damage.
AID00120738	Good to see them bullets didn't affect your charm none.
AID00120739	Now I ain't no optometrist, but maybe we should fit you for some glasses while you're here.
AID00120740	Nothing gets by you, huh? Coulda used you when I lost my keys last month.
AID00120741	Don't have all your coordination back yet, looks like. You should think about doing some rehab.
AID00120742	Most patients don't get out of bed after being shot and then move like they was in perfect control. You're unusual, I'll say that.
AID00120743	Yep, that's a pretty standard score there. But after what you been through, I'd say that's great news.
AID00120744	VCG01Intro
AID00120745	You're awake. How about that.
AID00120746	Whoa, easy there. Easy. You been out cold a couple of days now.
AID00120747	Why don't you just relax a second? Get your bearings.
AID00120748	Let's see what the damage is. How about your name? Can you tell me your name?
AID00120749	Huh. Can't say it's what I'd have picked for you. But if that's your name, that's your name.
AID00120750	I'm Doc Mitchell. Welcome to Goodsprings.
AID00120751	Now, I hope you don't mind, but I had to go rooting around there in your noggin to pull all the bits of lead out.
AID00120752	I take pride in my needlework, but you'd better tell me if I left anything out of place.
AID00120753	How'd I do?
AID00120754	Well, I got most of it right, anyway. Stuff that mattered.
AID00120755	Okay. No sense keeping you in bed anymore. Let's see if we can get you on your feet.
AID00120756	Good. Why don't you walk down to the end of the room? Over by that vigor tester machine there.
AID00120757	Take it slow now. It ain't a race.
AID00120758	Looking good so far. Go ahead and give the vigor tester a try. We'll learn right quick if you got back all your faculties.
AID00120759	Let's go into the next room. I've got a few more tests I'd like to run.
AID00120760	Goodbye.
AID00120761	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse.
AID00120762	Wasteland critters like to move in when Sunny's not looking, so watch out.
AID00120763	Yup.
AID00120764	How hard can it be? Just light them and throw.
AID00120765	[FAILED] Too dangerous, sorry. Blow yourself up, blow your neighbor up, blow the whole town up.
AID00120766	I'm familiar with the care and handling of explosives, dynamite included.
AID00120767	[SUCCEEDED] Uh huh. Guess you know what you're doing. I'll go dig it up and get it ready. You'll have it by the time the fighting starts.
AID00120768	I hear you've got dynamite. It would help us beat the powder gangers.
AID00120769	Too dangerous. Gonna kill all yourselves if I let you touch it. Better to leave it buried - safer that way.
AID00120770	Told you before - it's too dangerous for a bunch of amateurs to handle.
AID00120771	Never mind.
AID00120772	Right. Just keep me out of it. Is there anything else?
AID00120773	The town's at stake. That has to be worth more than a few supplies.
AID00120774	[FAILED] Look, you're bringing this on yourselves. There's no way I'm getting involved. But, hey, I'm sure you can buy what you need...
AID00120775	Let them take over the town, then. I'm sure your business will be much better off.
AID00120776	[SUCCEEDED] You made your point. I can provide people with some leather armor and extra ammo. I sure hope it's worth it.
AID00120777	And, uh, I'll be guarding the store while all this is going on. I have to put my business first, you understand.
AID00120778	I need supplies to fight the Powder Gangers.
AID00120779	Now just hold on. I never voted to take on the Powder Gangers. That's a thousand cap investment you're talking about.
AID00120780	This again? Like I said, I'm against taking on the Powder Gangers. My supplies aren't cheap, you know.
AID00120781	What do you do around here?
AID00120782	Oh, sorry. I thought everybody knew already. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00120783	I'm, uh, staying in town for a bit.
AID00120784	Like I said, I'm not from Goodsprings. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00120785	Goodbye.
AID00120786	Goodbye.
AID00120787	Take it easy now.
AID00120788	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00120789	I respect the way you've conducted yourself around here. Reminds me of myself in some ways.
AID00120790	From now on, you want to buy from Chet's, I'll give you wholesale prices.
AID00120791	Can do.
AID00120792	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00120793	Got a special discount for you, after what you done for us.
AID00120794	I'm sure I've got something you'll like.
AID00120795	What are you going to do?
AID00120796	Some of the others, like Sunny, will probably stand up for Ringo if he asks for help, which he hasn't.
AID00120797	Personally, I hope he sneaks out of town one night and takes the Powder Gangers with him.
AID00120798	Why not just kill Cobb and be done with it?
AID00120799	You mean murder him? That's not our way, even if Cobb is scum. He can bluster and threaten all he wants.
AID00120800	Where is Ringo now?
AID00120801	He's holed up at the abandoned gas station up the hill.
AID00120802	Goodbye.
AID00120803	Be careful out there.
AID00120804	I overheard your argument. What was that all about?
AID00120805	It looks like our little town got itself dragged into the middle of something we don't want anything to do with.
AID00120806	About a week ago, this trader, Ringo, comes into town. Survivor of an attack, he says. Bad men after him, needs a place to hide.
AID00120807	We figured he was just in shock, so we gave him a place to lie low. We didn't actually expect anyone to come after him.
AID00120808	What was that you said about Ringo?
AID00120809	He's some trader who decided he'd rather shoot than pay the toll for being in our territory. He's hiding somewhere in town.
AID00120810	Would serve these idiots right if me and my guys shot the place up after we got payback on Ringo.
AID00120811	Why are the Powder Gangers out to get you?
AID00120812	My caravan was on the return trip from California and heading back up to the company branch in New Vegas when we got jumped.
AID00120813	Not even a "drop your weapons and hands up" before the bullets started flying. We put up a good fight, but there was too many of them.
AID00120814	I took a few of the bandits down before I ran, so I figure their friends are out for revenge.
AID00120815	Never mind.
AID00120816	Uh huh.
AID00120817	That's... helpful.
AID00120818	Welcome.
AID00120819	What do you know about Joe Cobb?
AID00120820	Bad trouble.
AID00120821	What do you know about the situation with the Powder Gangers?
AID00120822	If Ringo doesn't head out on his own, I think we should hand him over. The town shouldn't get itself mixed into the problem.
AID00120823	Don't mistake that for coward talk, though. We're a town of survivors, and we'll fight tooth and nail if pushed, but we don't go looking for trouble.
AID00120824	Did you know there's a man named Joe Cobb looking for you?
AID00120825	Yeah. He doesn't look very tough, though. I hear he's afraid I'll shoot him down from one of the windows when I see him, and he's right.
AID00120826	I'll have a much bigger problem once his friends show up. There's no way I could handle all of them in a gunfight.
AID00120827	GSJoeCobbIntro
AID00120828	I'm done being nice. If you don't hand Ringo over soon, I'm going to get my friends and we're burning this town to the ground, got it?
AID00120829	I haven't talked to her yet.
AID00120830	Oh. Well, I don't want to make a move until she's with us.
AID00120831	Goodbye.
AID00120832	Try to hurry.
AID00120833	Sunny's with us.
AID00120834	Well, I guess that means we're ready to go. Unless you think there's something else you can do?
AID00120835	How can I get Easy Pete's dynamite?
AID00120836	Easy Pete's pretty protective of his dynamite. You'd have to convince him you know a thing or two about explosives before he handed it over.
AID00120837	Any ideas on how to convince Trudy to join us?
AID00120838	A silver tongue would help. Convincing Trudy that we had a good plan to win the fight would also help.
AID00120839	We might die horribly. Well, maybe not me.
AID00120840	That's inspiring. You might want to keep your optimism to yourself if you try to recruit anyone else.
AID00120841	Just like that?
AID00120842	Just like that. I have a feeling that I'm going to end up fighting those guys one way or another, so I might as well get it over with.
AID00120843	Well, that was easy.
AID00120844	Joe Cobb talks about leaving us alone if we hand over Ringo, but I know his type. He and his friends will come after the town eventually.
AID00120845	However, between you, me, and Ringo, we aren't exactly a force to be reckoned with. A lot of people around here look up to Trudy.
AID00120846	If you could convince Trudy to join us, some of the folks in town might decide to help out as well.
AID00120847	I know Easy Pete's got a stock of dynamite somewhere, and Chet just got a shipment of leather armor we could borrow. Talk to them as well.
AID00120848	Finally, there's a good chance we'll all end up with extra holes in us, so if Doc Mitchell could cough up some extra stimpaks, that'd be great.
AID00120849	Even though Joe Cobb's dead, his friends will come after the town eventually.
AID00120850	However, between you, me, and Ringo, we aren't exactly a force to be reckoned with. A lot of people around here look up to Trudy.
AID00120851	If you could convince Trudy to join us, some of the folks in town might decide to help out as well.
AID00120852	I know Easy Pete's got a stock of dynamite somewhere, and Chet just got a shipment of leather armor we could borrow. Talk to them as well.
AID00120853	Finally, there's a good chance we'll all end up with extra holes in us, so if Doc Mitchell could cough up some extra stimpaks, that'd be great.
AID00120854	I'm going to help Ringo take on the powder gangers. I might need your help.
AID00120855	Say no more. I'm in.
AID00120856	Goodbye.
AID00120857	I'll be waiting.
AID00120858	Until next time.
AID00120859	You don't think I can handle myself in a fight?
AID00120860	I was thinking of myself, actually. Who's going to watch my back while I'm watching yours?
AID00120861	I'll ask around and see who I can round up.
AID00120862	Start with Sunny Smiles. She's been friendlier than most around here.
AID00120863	Maybe I can help.
AID00120864	I saw you being awfully friendly with Joe Cobb, so no thanks.
AID00120865	No thanks. I think we'd need some of Goodsprings on our side, and I hear you're not exactly friendly with them.
AID00120866	We'd just end up sharing the same grave if it's just the two of us. Now, if some of the other people in town were also on board...
AID00120867	It's odd that Cobb wasn't able to find Ringo. The town's not that big.
AID00120868	Cobb hasn't exactly been looking for Ringo too hard - I think he's afraid that Ringo will ambush him, which is probably true.
AID00120869	What are you going to do about the Powder Gangers?
AID00120870	I'm going to lay low for as long as I can, assuming the town doesn't throw me to the wolves. I've got no chance against the gang on my own.
AID00120871	I'm still laying low.
AID00120872	How many powder gangers are out there?
AID00120873	At least a dozen, I'd say. And that was just the group that attacked us. For all I know, they've got a lot more friends lurking around.
AID00120874	NellisArgyllPatientKilled
AID00120875	Hold it right there! You had no business treating that man. You may've spared him a lingering death, but that's straight-out malpractice.
AID00120876	Sounds like a bunch of winners.
AID00120877	Whatever. Not like I need any of them. I do just fine on my own.
AID00120878	That's charming. It's good to know team-building is alive and well.
AID00120879	[FAILED] Hey, you asked. Don't want the answer, don't ask a guy's opinion.
AID00120880	[SUCCEEDED] Shit, maybe you're right. Guess I ought to give them a shot.
AID00120881	Great, maybe you can help me get this squad working together!
AID00120882	[FAILED] Why would I? If this unit improves its performance, we'll be shipped to the front lines. That's hardly conducive to living a long life.
AID00120883	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. You're trying to appeal to my ego. I must admit, it's an effective tactic. All right - I'll help.
AID00120884	But only because I want to see if it's even possible.
AID00120885	Since you're so respected, maybe you can help get this unit into shape.
AID00120886	I wonder if anyone else would share that sentiment.
AID00120887	Genius is seldom appreciated in its own time.
AID00120888	So, that's a no, then?
AID00120889	I suppose if you must stick with your narrow, parochial view of "in charge," then yes, it's a no. Are we done?
AID00120890	Tough luck. If the Legion attacks, they're dead meat.
AID00120891	I'd be skeptical of the odds, myself. I just hope they figure it out before it comes to that.
AID00120892	Maybe I can help you whip them into shape.
AID00120893	You're welcome to try - hell, maybe they'll listen to somebody they don't see as an authority figure.
AID00120894	<Lie> I assume the ants' tibular nastis pierced the patients' anterior traxes?
AID00120895	[SUCCEEDED] Well... I don't know, actually... I suppose it's possible. You should take a look!
AID00120896	<Lie> I'm a medical expert and my specialty is giant insect bites!
AID00120897	[FAILED] These patients were gravely injured. It's not a joking matter!
AID00120898	Player has medical knowledge.
AID00120899	[SUCCEEDED] If what you say is true, you can do us a world of good.
AID00120900	I have extensive medical knowledge. Let's see what I can do.
AID00120901	[FAILED] No need to apologize. Their care is my responsibility, not yours. Thing is, everything I know came out of a first aid handbook!
AID00120902	If you think you know more than that, let me know.
AID00120903	Sorry. I'm sure you know more than I do.
AID00120904	I'm sorry, I don't know enough to help. I wish I did.
AID00120905	Don't apologize. Their care is my responsibility, but everything I know came from an old first aid field manual.
AID00120906	I don't know what else to do to help them...
AID00120907	Goodbye.
AID00120908	Goodbye.
AID00120909	I need medical treatment.
AID00120910	Seeing as you're a friend of ours, I suppose we could trade for what you need.
AID00120911	I'm afraid medications are in short supply. Maybe you should seek medical treatment away from Nellis.
AID00120912	I'm looking for ways to make myself useful.
AID00120913	Well, look elsewhere. I can't let you near a patient after what happened.
AID00120914	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
AID00120915	You're finished? So are they, I'm afraid. Your medicine was almost as dangerous to them as those giant ants!
AID00120916	I'm finished with your patients.
AID00120917	You did more harm than good, I think. Your heart was in the right place, at least.
AID00120918	I'm finished with your patients.
AID00120919	Those men owe you their lives. Seems we could learn a thing or two from you savages, when it comes to medicine, at least.
AID00120920	I've finished treating your patients.
AID00120921	Well, there are still patients left to treat... though I worry you'll just make them worse.
AID00120922	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
AID00120923	There are still patients in need of treatment. Help them if you can.
AID00120924	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
AID00120925	I have three patients here who were gravely injured fighting those giant ants in the generator building a few days ago.
AID00120926	I've stabilized their wounds, but they're in bad shape. Do you have medical training?
AID00120927	Wait. I may have missed an ant or two.
AID00120928	"You may have missed an ant or two?" Get back down there and finish those ants off!
AID00120929	Just doing my part to help out.
AID00120930	I already said you did a good job. I don't give out hugs.
AID00120931	<Lie> Yep, power on, ant's dead, all good.
AID00120932	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
AID00120933	I'll tell Loyal to send someone down to clear out the eggs and repair the generators. Good work.
AID00120934	[FAILED] You're a terrible liar. Get down there and clear out those ants.
AID00120935	<Lie> I... Um... Tamed the ants, you don't have to worry about them anymore.
AID00120936	Well, most of the ants are dead.
AID00120937	I didn't tell you to kill most of the ants. It's an either-or proposition. Get down there and finish them off.
AID00120938	Yes, it's safe to go down there now.
AID00120939	Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
AID00120940	I'll tell Loyal to send someone down to clear out the eggs and repair the generators. Good work.
AID00120941	All dead.
AID00120942	If that's so, why isn't the power back on? Remember how I told you to power up the generators when the ants are dead?
AID00120943	Looks like you've still got some work left to do.
AID00120944	Still in progress.
AID00120945	It's not in progress if you're up here talking to me. Get it taken care of.
AID00120946	Thanks, but there are easier ways to commit suicide.
AID00120947	A savage, scared of bugs? I don't believe it. I'm sure you'll change your mind.
AID00120948	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
AID00120949	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
AID00120950	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
AID00120951	I'll do it, even though you're just trying to get me killed.
AID00120952	Don't get my hopes up.
AID00120953	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
AID00120954	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
AID00120955	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
AID00120956	I can handle a few ants.
AID00120957	Sure, anyone can. But there's more than a few down there. See for yourself.
AID00120958	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
AID00120959	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
AID00120960	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
AID00120961	Goodbye.
AID00120962	We haven't seen the last of each other, savage.
AID00120963	Get those ants handled, savage.
AID00120964	Stay out of trouble.
AID00120965	If I do, you'll be the first to know.
AID00120966	All I need is a pretext.
AID00120967	Mother Pearl said you have a "bug problem?"
AID00120968	Long story short, the power failed a few days ago because giant ants have tunneled into the generator room and set up a nest.
AID00120969	I led a team down to exterminate them, but there were... so many of them. We lost two killed, three wounded.
AID00120970	Personally, I think it's more than a savage can handle, but if you want to kill those ants and switch the power back on, feel free.
AID00120971	Sorry, not interested. I'll be leaving.
AID00120972	I'll send word to the spotters to let you come and go as you wish. Why not stay awhile before you head out?
AID00120973	Where do I start?
AID00120974	You picked a good time to stop by, for we're swimming in problems. My youngers can tell you all about it.
AID00120975	Raquel could use help with the bug problem, Doc Argyll has wounded he's tending to, and Loyal and Jack might be looking for help with some repairs.
AID00120976	Or you could just go see Pete at the museum and hear the story of our people. All you have to do there is listen.
AID00120977	Come and go as you like, help or don't help, I leave it up to you. But I hope you'll show my youngers that not every outsider needs to be blown up.
AID00120978	<SPEECH TEST: Player presses for details>
AID00120979	[SUCCEEDED] You have to keep in mind that you're our first contact with the outside world since I was barely a woman.
AID00120980	Seclusion has kept us safe. but the world around us is changing. Neon lights in the distance, patrolling robots, soldiers...
AID00120981	My youngers think our guns can keep out the world, but I think we need to let it in, just a little, or become its victim.
AID00120982	You're that little bit of the world, child. Welcome to Nellis.
AID00120983	How can we trust each other if you're going to be keeping secrets?
AID00120984	[FAILED] If I were your grandma, I'd wash out your mouth with Abraxo for being so rude, child!
AID00120985	I don't like being kept in dark, grandma. Clue me in.
AID00120986	Why are you called Easy Pete?
AID00120987	Was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR. Now I just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Bighorners.
AID00120988	No, I haven't found him yet.
AID00120989	Okay, well thanks for looking. Let me know when you find him.
AID00120990	<Lie> I'm sorry Lindsay. Mister Cuddles is dead.
AID00120991	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles!
AID00120992	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles! He can't be dead!
AID00120993	<Lie> I already told you he's dead. Get over it already, kid.
AID00120994	[FAILED] I know you're kidding. Mister Cuddles is just hiding somewhere.
AID00120995	I have Mister Cuddles right here.
AID00120996	Oh! Thank you so much! I'll never lose you again Mister Cuddles!
AID00120997	Great work Lindsay! I'll go take a look for him.
AID00120998	Thanks! Let me know when you find him.
AID00120999	Think really hard. What were you doing when you saw him last?
AID00121000	Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
AID00121001	Ok, I'll look for him.
AID00121002	Thanks! Let me know when you find him.
AID00121003	Sorry, I don't have time right now.
AID00121004	Oh. Bye then.
AID00121005	Who is Mister Cuddles?
AID00121006	Mister Cuddles is my teddy. I lost him and I don't remember where.
AID00121007	NellisArgyllPatientHealedDumb
AID00121008	Now I know what they mean by "dumb luck"!
AID00121009	NellisArgyllPatientHarmed
AID00121010	Are you sure you know what you're doing? You nearly killed that man!
AID00121011	You've made him worse! Is that what you savages call medicine?
AID00121012	Were you exaggerating your knowledge of medicine? Even I would've known not to do that!
AID00121013	Any ideas how to get to the bottom of Lake Mead without drowning?
AID00121014	Might try holding your breath. If that doesn't sound good enough, talk to Jack. He was working on a rebreather once.
AID00121015	That's just about the stupidest idea I ever heard.
AID00121016	No, it's not. It's the smartest idea you ever heard, but you're too stupid to know it!
AID00121017	All right. I'm game.
AID00121018	Good. Here's the deployable ballast. Go find the plane, attach the ballast, and hit the button!
AID00121019	If it's so simple, why haven't you done it?
AID00121020	Maybe you don't understand. Hasn't been one of us, not a one, to set a foot outside Nellis in over fifty years.
AID00121021	You come along, with your knowledge of the outside, and it seems the time's come to raise the Lady after all.
AID00121022	That sounds impossible.
AID00121023	I know it does, but I tell you, it ain't! I've worked it out so it's simple!
AID00121024	That sounds really creepy, Loyal.
AID00121025	Ain't nothing creepy about it. It's a term of respect!
AID00121026	Maybe another time. Goodbye.
AID00121027	Did I misunderstand what Pearl said? All right. Goodbye.
AID00121028	<Lie> She was so excited to see you, she wouldn't wait.
AID00121029	[FAILED] Then why didn't you stop her? You could've tackled her or something! You knew how much she meant to me!
AID00121030	Just - just go away!
AID00121031	<Lie> It's a tragedy. She loved you so much, she risked it all.
AID00121032	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my sweet blameless Red! Curse the walls of Nellis! Curse our guns and isolation! Her blood is on our hands!
AID00121033	Only if we stop shelling everyone who comes close will some good come from this tragedy. If you'll excuse me...
AID00121034	It's not my fault that your tribe blows up everyone who comes close.
AID00121035	I wish we'd blown you up! I wish you were dead! Just leave me alone!
AID00121036	I told her how to get through the artillery barrage.
AID00121037	Wow, that seems dangerous, but if you really think it's safe, I'll trust you. You did make it here, afterall.
AID00121038	I spoke to Pearl, but Janet needs a way past the artillery.
AID00121039	Here take this Boomer outfit. I'll let the gunners know she is coming, and not to shoot at her.
AID00121040	I've seen her, but we haven't talked about you yet.
AID00121041	Well, please, talk to her soon. The suspense is killing me!
AID00121042	What are you waiting for? I've been losing sleep wonder what she'll say!
AID00121043	I've had other things to attend to.
AID00121044	You said you'd talk to her. Don't treat me like a jerk for asking.
AID00121045	Good news. She feels the same way.
AID00121046	She does? You mean it? That's incredible!
AID00121047	What happens next? Can she come here? How do we make sure she doesn't get blown up? Should I talk to the gunners? Or to Pearl?
AID00121048	Okay, I'm just really excited is all.
AID00121049	I'm working on it. I need to talk to Pearl first.
AID00121050	Oh, well let me know when you do.
AID00121051	I'm working on it.
AID00121052	Oh. That sort of "personal matter." Forget I asked.
AID00121053	Tell me about her.
AID00121054	I can wait until Pearl or Loyal want to tell me.
AID00121055	Thanks. Sometimes I talk too much. I guess you already know that.
AID00121056	Recover a Lady? What are you talking about?
AID00121057	Did I say that? Sometimes I just say stupid things! Sorry about that.
AID00121058	Pearl will tell you when the time comes. If, I mean. I should really be going.
AID00121059	Does Goodsprings get many visitors?
AID00121060	Mostly traders looking to buy Bighorner meat and hides. The traders are the main reason the general store manages to stay in business.
AID00121061	Most travelers heading south on in the I-15 just push on towards Primm unless they're in desperate need of supplies.
AID00121062	GSTrudyToJoe
AID00121063	We'll keep that in mind. Now, if you're not going to buy something, get out.
AID00121064	A head on a pillow.
AID00121065	Well, that's all she wrote.
AID00121066	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
AID00121067	A mushroom cloud.
AID00121068	Well, that's all she wrote.
AID00121069	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
AID00121070	A bearded man.
AID00121071	Well, that's all she wrote.
AID00121072	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
AID00121073	A light in the darkness.
AID00121074	Well, that's all she wrote.
AID00121075	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
AID00121076	Very interesting. Maybe a little disturbing, but interesting.
AID00121077	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
AID00121078	I'm too embarrassed to say what it looks like.

AID00121149	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.

AID00121231	Well, we know your vitals are good.
AID00121232	But that don't mean them bullets didn't leave you nuttier than a Bighorner dropping.
AID00121233	What do you say you take a seat on my couch and we go through a couple questions? See if your dogs are still barking.
AID00121234	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
AID00121235	If you want to know anything else, just ask.
AID00121236	What kind of creatures are out there?
AID00121237	Around here, mostly coyotes and geckos. The coyotes are pretty dangerous in large packs, but otherwise they're nothing to really worry about.
AID00121238	The geckos aren't too tough, but they've got a nasty bite. I've heard about bigger, nastier versions out in the wasteland, but I've never seen them.
AID00121239	Stick to the roads when you can, and steer clear of the hills north of Goodsprings. The critters up there are big and poisonous.
AID00121240	What other towns are nearby?
AID00121241	Southeast of here is Primm - can't miss it, since it has this giant old rollercoaster right in the middle of town. The NCR's got an outpost there.
AID00121242	If you follow the road north, you'll eventually hit Sloan and Quarry Junction. They mine rocks or something, but I heard they got troubles lately.
AID00121243	I wouldn't head that direction if I were you, though. Got critters up there that don't take kindly to getting shot.
AID00121244	Let's talk about the areas around Goodsprings.
AID00121245	Sure. What did you want to know?
AID00121246	<Speech check to get emitter>
AID00121247	[SUCCEEDED] If you're willing to take the risk, be my guest.
AID00121248	I've got it set to broadcast a powerful signal at 24,000 hertz. Just place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
AID00121249	Signal's too high for people to hear, so no harm done, but it might make you feel sick to your stomach.
AID00121250	Think of it as a field test. A trial run.
AID00121251	[FAILED] I don't even know what the hell you're talking about. Sounds like gibberish.
AID00121252	Maybe tilt the... megareceiver? To 73.5 kilonewtons...?
AID00121253	<Doc Outro>
AID00121254	Well, if you're heading back out there, you ought to have this.
AID00121255	They call it a Pip-Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults they made before the war. We all got one.
AID00121256	Ain't much use to me now, but you might want such a thing, after what you been through. I know what it's like, having something taken from you.
AID00121257	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Was my wife's.
AID00121258	I think she was about your size, and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.
AID00121259	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Never was much my style anyway.
AID00121260	You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town. She can help you learn to fend for yourself in the desert. She'll likely be at the saloon.
AID00121261	I reckon some of the other folks at the saloon might be able to help you out, too. And the metal fella, Victor, who pulled you outta your grave.
AID00121262	Anyway, you ever get hurt out there, you come right back. I'll fix you up.
AID00121263	But try not to get killed anymore.
AID00121264	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped this off. Said they found it near where Victor found you, and guessed it might be yours.
AID00121265	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped these off. Said they found them near where Victor found you, and guessed they might be yours.
AID00121266	VCG01DocFarewellTransition
AID00121267	All right. I guess that about does it.
AID00121268	Come with me. I'll see you out.
AID00121269	VCG01DocTraitIntro
AID00121270	Before I turn you loose, I need one more thing from you.
AID00121271	I got a form for you to fill out, so I can get a sense of your medical history.
AID00121272	Just a formality. Ain't like I expect to find you got a family history of getting shot in the head.
AID00121273	GSCheyenne
AID00121274	< sniff >
AID00121275	It occurs to me that I might cheat.
AID00121276	Hmm... an intriguing proposition.
AID00121277	Company readiness reports are logged on the computer systems at the Resort. If you hack the system, you could alter our records.
AID00121278	Such an attempt, however, is likely to thwart efforts to motivate the squad to do actual work. If such is your goal, you should look elsewhere.
AID00121279	Maybe I can help out.
AID00121280	And how would you propose accomplishing such a goal?
AID00121281	I guess you don't feel so smart now, huh?
AID00121282	Your insults are both unhelpful and unwanted. I'll thank you to keep them to yourself.
AID00121283	He thinks you might respond better to someone who isn't an authority figure.
AID00121284	This is an unexpected variable. I had hoped to coast on an easy wave of mediocrity to a cushy government pension.
AID00121285	If they don't, it's their loss.
AID00121286	I suppose so. Sorry, this isn't your problem, I shouldn't be going on to you about this.
AID00121287	Are you all right?
AID00121288	I am now. I was just minding my own business heading west when that psycho came out of nowhere and started shooting!
AID00121289	He kept shouting about stars or something. Does that make any sense to you?
AID00121290	No, I have to be going.
AID00121291	If you say so. Maybe we'll meet again.
AID00121292	I'd like to know more about star hunting.
AID00121293	There's not much more to tell. Get enough stars and the treasure's yours. Just watch out for some of the other people collecting them.
AID00121294	I'd like to trade.
AID00121295	Oh, that's right! Here, let me show you what I've got on hand.

AID00121304	It has come to our attention that some of our loyal customers are less than pleased with the reward for their Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
AID00121305	SSHQFestusMenu
AID00121306	New in town, pardner? Well, let ol' Festus give you the lay of the land.
AID00121307	If you're here to redeem your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars, dump 'em into the slot in the barrel below and I'll count 'em up.
AID00121308	If you don't know what Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars are and think ol' Festus is just shooting his mouth off, say "Star Info".
AID00121309	If you're here to challenge ol' Festus to a game of Lucky Horseshoes, say "I feel lucky".
AID00121310	Lastly, if you're here about the health advisory that aired on channel 6 recently, say "Silly Ol' Advisory."
AID00121311	Pleased to meetcha.
AID00121312	SSHQFestusStarInfo
AID00121313	Ah, new to the hunt, are you? Well listen carefully, as ol' Festus don't like to repeat himself.
AID00121314	Select Sunset Sarsaparilla bottles will have special caps with blue stars on them. These caps are known as Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
AID00121315	Why are these stars there, and what do they mean? Nobody knows! Except maybe ol' Festus, hee hee.
AID00121316	Rustle up enough of them and you can win a prize! So get out there, and start drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
AID00121317	Star Info.
AID00121318	SSHQFestusLOS18
AID00121319	The man felt the same, and had his own idea about what had happened. He went on to become rich selling the sarsaparilla drink, and started a company.
AID00121320	SSHQFestusLOS17
AID00121321	Now, I don't know about you, but old Festus here never met a bandit that felt anything akin to remorse.
AID00121322	SSHQFestusLOS16
AID00121323	The sheriff suggested that maybe the bandits, in a fit of remorse, delivered the items. After taking all of the stranger's money, of course.
AID00121324	SSHQFestusLOS15
AID00121325	Stunned by the news, the man told the sheriff about the note, bottle, and the deal he had with the stranger.
AID00121326	SSHQFestusLOS14
AID00121327	He had apparently been attacked by bandits on his way to the saloon the previous day.
AID00121328	SSHQFestusLOS13
AID00121329	That night, the local sheriff visited the saloon and reported that the stranger had been found on the side of the town road, murdered.
AID00121330	SSHQFestus
AID00121331	SSHQFestusLOS12
AID00121332	Opening the bottle, the man found the inside of the cap had the same blue star on it. He also found that the drink was delicious.
AID00121333	SSHQFestusLOS11
AID00121334	The man picked up the note, and found it contained a recipe for making a sarsaparilla-flavored drink, and was signed with a blue star.
AID00121335	SSHQFestusLOS10
AID00121336	The next day, the man came downstairs to find a single bottle with a note beneath it on the bar.
AID00121337	SSHQFestusLOS9
AID00121338	The man figured he had been tricked and went to sleep, leaving the ingredients he had purchased down by the bar.
AID00121339	SSHQFestusLOS8
AID00121340	The man happily agreed to the deal, and had the ingredients waiting the following day. But the sun came and went, and the stranger never came.
AID00121341	SSHQFestusLOS7
AID00121342	If the man bought the ingredients, the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day and teach him how to make a sarsaparilla drink.
AID00121343	SSHQFestusLOS6
AID00121344	The man had never heard of a drink with sarsaparilla in it, and said so. The stranger told the man that he'd make a deal with him.
AID00121345	SSHQFestusLOS5
AID00121346	Then one day, a stranger walked into the saloon. When asked what he'd like, the stranger replied, "You got anything with sarsaparilla in it?"
AID00121347	SSHQFestusLOS4
AID00121348	But the man was at a loss as to what kind of flavor to use. He asked all of his patrons for ideas, but they were no help at all.
AID00121349	SSHQFestusLOS3
AID00121350	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, something that tasted far different than anything else.
AID00121351	SSHQFestusLOS2
AID00121352	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
AID00121353	SSHQFestusLOS1
AID00121354	Looooong ago, people didn't really have many choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
AID00121355	SSHQFestusTestSay
AID00121356	SSHQFestusDepositStars
AID00121357	Wahoo, you did it pardner! Bully for you! Ol' Festus knew you could do it. I suppose you'll be wanting that prize now.
AID00121358	Well then, hold onto your hat, because it's a doozy. Not many people have heard the true story behind Sunset Sarsaparilla. It's a right honor.
AID00121359	And now, without further ado, your prize - The Legend of the Star...
AID00121360	Looooong ago, people didn't have a heap of choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
AID00121361	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
AID00121362	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, and asked his patrons what flavor they'd like it to be.
AID00121363	After getting no help from them, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested the man make a sarsaparilla flavored drink.
AID00121364	The stranger said he would happily share his family's recipe for the drink, on one condition.
AID00121365	The condition being that the stranger would be allowed to sample a bottle whenever he liked, to ensure the recipe was being followed to the letter.
AID00121366	The man happily agreed, thinking the drink would make him rich, and the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day.
AID00121367	The next morning, the sheriff stopped by and reported that the stranger's body was found on the side of the town road. He'd been killed by bandits.
AID00121368	The man, cursing his luck, closed the saloon early that day, just as the sun began to set.
AID00121369	But after he had locked the doors, he turned around to find an unfamiliar bottle on the bar, with a note beneath it.
AID00121370	The note was sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, the man found it contained a recipe for a sarsaparilla-flavored drink.
AID00121371	Sampling the bottle's contents and finding it singularly delicious, the man gave silent thanks to his mysterious benefactor, wherever he was.
AID00121372	Being an honorable man, the saloon owner paid for the stranger's funeral, thinking it was the least he could do to repay him.
AID00121373	The saloon owner went on to become rich selling the new drink, and to this day some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a blue star under their caps.
AID00121374	Some say the saloon owner ordered it done, in honor of the stranger. Others say it's the stranger, sampling the bottles like he promised.
AID00121375	And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
AID00121376	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
AID00121377	By my hat, you're flush with Stars, ain't you? Scratch up a few more and the prize's yours.
AID00121378	Well, what in the Sam Hill are you doing still listening to me? Get a wiggle on and find those last few Stars!
AID00121379	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
AID00121380	It looks like you've got a fair number of Stars in your saddlebags. You're still a few cards short of a hand, though.
AID00121381	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
AID00121382	That's a good start there, soft-horn, but that's not enough by a long chalk.
AID00121383	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
AID00121384	SSHQFestusLHInstructions
AID00121385	Lucky Horseshoes is played with cards numbered two through ten and aces, which have a value of one.
AID00121386	You and ol' Festus will take turns drawing cards. Each time we draw a card, we add it to our total, trying to hit the magic number of twenty one.
AID00121387	If either of us draws a card that brings our total up to the same number as the other, it pushes the other player's total up one.
AID00121388	When this happens, it's called Lucky Horseshoes! Ol' Festus thought of the name himself, I'll have you know.
AID00121389	When one of us is closer to twenty one and the other can't get any closer, either by going over or because he or she held, the closer player wins.
AID00121390	Ol' Festus likes the game because there are no ties in Lucky Horseshoes. If someone's sitting pretty on twenty one, lady luck can still bump 'em off!
AID00121391	But enough jawing. By now you're as eager as I am to get tossing.
AID00121392	How do I play?
AID00121393	Lucky Horseshoes.
AID00121394	All right, let's play, pardner! Press the blue button to draw a card, the red button to hold, or the yeller button to quit.
AID00121395	What do you do around here?
AID00121396	I hunt geckos, mostly. The meat's pretty good and I can always find a buyer for the hides.
AID00121397	I also help keep the town clear of radscorpions and coyotes. Not many people live in Goodsprings, so wildlife is always creeping in.
AID00121398	Stay here for now. I'll see if there's anything else I can do first.
AID00121399	All right. I'll just wait here until you come get me.
AID00121400	Let's do this.
AID00121401	All right, I'm ready. I hope.
AID00121402	Fine. Here's 1000 caps.
AID00121403	That's more like it. The people can pick up their extra ammo and leather armor when they're ready. Was there anything else?
AID00121404	I wish I could've done more to save him.
AID00121405	At least his death was quick. Cobb's gang had much worse in mind for him.
AID00121406	You're welcome.
AID00121407	I'll stick around for a bit longer, but I'll be gone in a few days. If you ever visit New Vegas, look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp.
AID00121408	I'll consider it.
AID00121409	All right. Was there anything else you wanted to talk to me about?
AID00121410	I don't need payment.
AID00121411	I won't let you stick your neck out for free. I can't pay you back now, but I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays up. You've got my word.
AID00121412	It'll have to do. What now?
AID00121413	You need a hired gun. I'm available.
AID00121414	All I've got left on me are a handful of caps, but you get me out of this, and I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays you back. You've got my word.
AID00121415	Let's go.
AID00121416	Oh, Easy Pete came through with the dynamite. Here's your supply. I really hope I don't blow myself up.
AID00121417	I'll be set up near the store. Let's hope that the gang doesn't manage to make it that far.
AID00121418	Where's Trudy and the rest?
AID00121419	They're getting set up in cover, but it might not go well unless we get out there soon.
AID00121420	How many are there?
AID00121421	At least six, Joe Cobb included. They look pretty mean.
AID00121422	At least six. They look pretty mean.
AID00121423	I'm just passing through.
AID00121424	Okay, see ya!
AID00121425	I'm just passing through.
AID00121426	Okay, see ya!
AID00121427	I'm just passing through.
AID00121428	Okay, see ya!
AID00121429	I'm just passing through.
AID00121430	Okay, see ya!
AID00121431	I'm just passing through.
AID00121432	Okay, see ya!
AID00121433	I'm just passing through.
AID00121434	Bye then. 
AID00121435	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Does La Fantoma need some power gum?
AID00121436	La Fantoma doesn't want to ge sick again! No nasty gum for her!
AID00121437	[Offer Chems] You know what will help you box better? Psycho, would you like some?
AID00121438	Red-Brick never touches chems! That stuff will tear you up!
AID00121439	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Here take this gum instead.
AID00121440	This toll only accepts toys, and that gum is gross.
AID00121441	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Astronauts chew space gum.
AID00121442	No way, I hear that stuff rots your brain and stuff.
AID00121443	[Offer Radiactive Gum] I hear dinosaurs like gum.
AID00121444	Nuh uh! That gum gets dinosaurs sick.
AID00121445	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Here you go kid, gum is fun!
AID00121446	Ick! My big sister got super sick chewing that stuff!
AID00121447	I believe La Fantoma could use a rocket toy to enhancer her flight.
AID00121448	La Fantoma needs no rocket... But this one is pretty awesome!
AID00121449	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hmm, will this rocket cover my toll?
AID00121450	You may pass!
AID00121451	Mission control, you can't fly without a rocket. Here take this toy rocket.
AID00121452	This is spiffy! Thanks!
AID00121453	[Offer Toy Dinosaur] Woah there Red-Brick, why don't you box with this dinosaur toy.
AID00121454	Great! I've been wanting a new toy!
AID00121455	[Offer Dinosaur Toy] Oh, then I bet you'd love this dinosaur toy.
AID00121456	I sure would! Thanks a billion!
AID00121457	[Offer Toy Rocket] I found this rocket toy you can have.
AID00121458	A rocket! Yay!  Vrooom!
AID00121459	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Hey kid, I have some gum here. It is good for you!
AID00121460	No way! Pearl said that stuff will get us sick!
AID00121461	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hey there. I have a nice toy rocket for you.
AID00121462	This is spiffy! Thanks!
AID00121463	I'm just passing through.
AID00121464	Okay, see ya!
AID00121465	What the hell just happened?
AID00121466	Any idea why?
AID00121467	No, none at all. We've been traveling together since I picked her up a few days ago, and she's been friendly this whole time.
AID00121468	We'd actually been flirting a little when she suddenly pulled a gun out and began yelling at me to hand my caps over.
AID00121469	Now that I think of it, though, she laughed when I threw her my money. I think what she really wanted was my lucky charm necklace.
AID00121470	SSHQJacklynSucker
AID00121471	Sucker.
AID00121472	Do you have any bottlecaps with stars on them?
AID00121473	Er, no, I don't think so. Caps are caps, right?
AID00121474	Look, I think I need a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Once again, thanks.
AID00121475	No idea.
AID00121476	No reason it should, I suppose. I need to be going. Thank you again.
AID00121477	Yes, he was probably trying to steal some Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars from you.
AID00121478	Some what? Never mind, I'm going to take a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Thank you again.
AID00121479	What did he want?
AID00121480	SSHQTomasWhat
AID00121481	SSHQJacklynHelp
AID00121482	Help! You there, please help me!
AID00121483	He's crazy! Please help me!
AID00121484	NCR?
AID00121485	The New California Republic. Bunch of settlers and soldiers coming in from the West, fixing on making Nevada their own.
AID00121486	They can be right pushy, but the roads are safer 'cause of them, so I tend to let it go.
AID00121487	Not that I got a choice.
AID00121488	Goodbye.
AID00121489	Goodbye.
AID00121490	What say I help you take over this town?
AID00121491	No. I got a funny feeling about you, and there's no way I'm trusting you to watch my back.
AID00121492	Let me get out of town before we talk. Too many unfriendly ears around.
AID00121493	What the hell for? Just farmers and ranchers out here. Not much worth stealing.
AID00121494	Didn't you already ask me about this? What the hell for - this place is worthless.
AID00121495	We all knew what we were getting into.
AID00121496	You're right, we did. I just wish things had turned out better.
AID00121497	Yes, terrible shame. Did you find anything of value on the Powder Gangers?
AID00121498	Looting the bodies isn't a priority to me, but you go right on ahead.
AID00121499	Do you know anything about the people who attacked me?
AID00121500	The one in the fancy suit seemed to be calling the shots, that's as much as I know. Other folks in town might know more.
AID00121501	Word of advice, though: if you ever catch up with him, watch out. The man's got cold eyes like a snake. Can't be trusted, I'd say.
AID00121502	Well, I think that went well, don't you?
AID00121503	Thanks for the help. I think the whole unit's doing a lot better now.
AID00121504	That was... something. Thanks for trying, at any rate.
AID00121505	Exhale before you fire. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it.
AID00121506	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Exhale... squeeze. Focus on the shot.
AID00121507	[FAILED] I'm really not sure that's how this works.
AID00121508	You're never going to hit anything shooting in one direction. Fire wildly!
AID00121509	Take your time. Pick your shots and tell your squadmates who you're shooting at.
AID00121510	[SUCCEEDED] I've got the one at 11 o'clock! Razz, O'Hanrahan, take the two on the right! Poindexter, the center!
AID00121511	[FAILED] Faster, people, faster! More lead in the air!
AID00121512	No, no, you're doing it all wrong! Shoot faster! *Faster!*
AID00121513	Take positions where you can cover each other. Stay focused.
AID00121514	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the man, people, get focused!
AID00121515	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the lady, people, get focused!
AID00121516	[FAILED] Okay... sure. Everybody shoot the hell out of the target!
AID00121517	Umm... I guess everybody should shoot the hell out of the target?
AID00121518	SSHQMrJanitorRandomCleaningComment
AID00121519	I see my services are required once more. It's about time.
AID00121520	Oh my. This place is filthy.
AID00121521	It's amazing how much dust collects if you leave things alone even for a short while.
AID00121522	Really, someone should have called me earlier.
AID00121523	This room is even worse than the last one.
AID00121524	What have you savages been doing here?
AID00121525	Ah, a job well done is it's own reward. Good riddance to this rubbish.

AID00121532	SSHQFestusLOS20
AID00121533	And sometimes, you can even find a blue star under the cap, just like that man did so many years ago.
AID00121534	SSHQFestusLOS18
AID00121535	And to this day, you can get a Sunset Sarsaparilla and enjoy the refreshing taste of that very same drink.
AID00121536	I've decided to kill you for Joe Cobb.
AID00121537	What? No!
AID00121538	All right, I'll kill him for you.
AID00121539	You can't find Ringo yourself?
AID00121540	There are too many places to hide around here. He'd see me coming and then "bam", I'm dead.
AID00121541	He doesn't know you, though. He probably won't shoot right away.
AID00121542	Never mind. I need to think about this.
AID00121543	Fuck you, then.
AID00121544	Deal.
AID00121545	While you're doing that, I'll be here waiting for my friends. Join up with us once you're done.
AID00121546	Get the troops lines up. I'll help you with it.
AID00121547	After the help you gave us with the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
AID00121548	I think that went well, don't you?
AID00121549	Yeah, I do. Thanks. I think we might survive this now.
AID00121550	You've got a funny definition of "well," you know that? Whatever. Thanks for... whatever that was.
AID00121551	Don't worry about accuracy - use the grenades to break up clusters of enemies.
AID00121552	[SUCCEEDED] Hold the grenades for groups, squad! Hit them in clusters and send them running!
AID00121553	[FAILED] What the... what the hell are you talking about?
AID00121554	No, no, no! You have to *hit* the target with the grenade or it won't go off!
AID00121555	Don't pitch it like a baseball, lob it. You want a good, solid arc.
AID00121556	[SUCCEEDED] Solid arc, check. Lob 'em up and over, people!
AID00121557	[FAILED] They're kind of heavy for that, but whatever you say....
AID00121558	Now, um... really whip them downrange. Like you're throwing a fastball!
AID00121559	Okay, to start, pull the pin, let it cook off for a count of three, then throw.
AID00121560	[FAILED] I've got a bad feeling about this....
AID00121561	Okay, count to three, throw the grenade, and pull the pin. Wait, no....
AID00121562	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Easy enough. One... two... three!
AID00121563	Don't worry, I'm not giving up. Let's try it again.
AID00121564	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
AID00121565	Sorry, I was mistaken. I don't have any extra missiles.
AID00121566	What kind of fool doesn't keep track of reserve ammunition? Don't waste my time.
AID00121567	I have 10 spare missiles.
AID00121568	Good work.
AID00121569	I have 5 spare missiles.
AID00121570	Thanks. Those'll last us a day.
AID00121571	I have 1 spare missile.
AID00121572	It's better than nothing.
AID00121573	I have some missiles for you.
AID00121574	How many?
AID00121575	I'm not sure if I'll be able to spare any, but I'll let you know.
AID00121576	Fine.
AID00121577	Will do.
AID00121578	Come find me when you've got some to turn in.
AID00121579	Nice talking to you.
AID00121580	Right.
AID00121581	Anything else I can help out with?
AID00121582	The next time you leave Nellis, keep an eye out for missiles. We're down to a five-year supply for our launchers.
AID00121583	Here's three doses of Rad-Away.
AID00121584	Hold still. This'll burn for a moment.
AID00121585	All right. Here's two doses of Fixer.
AID00121586	You're going to feel a little pinch.
AID00121587	NellisArgyllMedicalChatter
AID00121588	Got yourself cut up pretty good, eh?
AID00121589	Next time don't wait so long before you seek medical attention.
AID00121590	It's a good thing you made it in when you did.
AID00121591	You need to be more careful, you can really get hurt out there.
AID00121592	No, thanks.
AID00121593	Well, try to avoid further exposure.
AID00121594	Here are two Stimpaks.
AID00121595	This'll make you feel better.
AID00121596	No, thanks.
AID00121597	The symptoms of withdrawal will pass with time.
AID00121598	Here's two doses of Rad-Away.
AID00121599	Hold still. This'll burn for a moment.
AID00121600	No, thanks.
AID00121601	Fair enough.
AID00121602	All right. Here's three doses of Fixer.
AID00121603	You're going to feel a little pinch.
AID00121604	I'm suffering from radiation sickness.
AID00121605	I can help you in exchange for Stimpaks.
AID00121606	I can help you in exchange for Stimpaks.
AID00121607	I need help with an addiction.
AID00121608	I can unburden you of that in exchange for doses of Rad-Away.
AID00121609	I can unburden you of that in exchange for doses of Rad-Away.
AID00121610	I have wounds that need mending.
AID00121611	I can patch you up in exchange for doses of Fixer.
AID00121612	I can patch you up in exchange for doses of Fixer.
AID00121613	VFreeformNellisPeteMural10
AID00121614	I'm pleased that you listened to the entire story! Perhaps there are details you'd like to know more about? Let me know.
AID00121615	VFreeformNellisPeteMural09
AID00121616	To restore the bomber, to fly the open skies in armored safety, raining high-explosive ordnance upon ignorant savages - this is our destiny!
AID00121617	VFreeformNellisPeteMural08
AID00121618	And that is our story so far, for this last image is our future.
AID00121619	VFreeformNellisPeteMural07
AID00121620	Nellis has revealed many secrets. It has taught us how to fly the bombers once based here. And it has taught us where to find one!
AID00121621	VFreeformNellisPeteMural06
AID00121622	Well, until... but... not saying you want to harm us or you're a savage, but... anyways.
AID00121623	VFreeformNellisPeteMural05
AID00121624	Here, we have prospered and multiplied. Here, our mighty guns destroy any savages who might try to harm us before they can even reach our gates!
AID00121625	VFreeformNellisPeter04
AID00121626	Nellis, glittering like shrapnel in the desert sun. Nellis, bursting with missiles, warheads, and bombs. Nellis had waited. Just for us.
AID00121627	VFreeformNellisPeterMural03
AID00121628	It was neat, but there was a downside. For every 43.6 savages we killed, we lost one of our own. We needed a new home. We needed Nellis.
AID00121629	VFreeformNellisPeterMural02
AID00121630	We left and wandered the wastes. There were savages with knives. We blew them up with frag mines and grenades, burned them with flamethrowers.
AID00121631	VFreeformNellisPeterMural01
AID00121632	Ages ago, long before I was born, we lived underground. Everyone had guns but the overseer wouldn't let us explode anything, not even a hand grenade.
AID00121633	I repaired the solar arrays.
AID00121634	Well, how about that! I'll have to check out your handywork.
AID00121635	And here I thought we had them running as best we could before they broke down again. Thanks for getting those sorted for me.
AID00121636	I fixed the arrays and improved their efficiency a bit too.
AID00121637	Well, how about that! Turns out you aren't completely useless, working with your hands.
AID00121638	VFreeformGoodSpringsDocMitchellSpeechCheck
AID00121639	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
AID00121640	Isn't it customary for a doctor to prescribe follow-up medication?
AID00121641	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
AID00121642	My wounds still hurt a little. Can you give me something for the pain, Doc?
AID00121643	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
AID00121644	I'm in a *lot* of pain, Doc. Can you spare any more?
AID00121645	[FAILED] Sorry. I'm afraid I'm all out of lollipops.
AID00121646	Don't I at least get a lollipop before leaving, Doc?
AID00121647	VCG01dummy
AID00121648	VCG01DocMitchellTellMeAboutYou
AID00121649	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, was a traveling doctor for a spell.
AID00121650	Seemed like a good idea at the time. Most folks out here ain't educated, so people with medical knowhow are hard to come by.
AID00121651	Found that I could help a lot of people with what I knew, and that was all right with me.
AID00121652	Eventually, I went back and married my childhood sweetheart and that was the end of my traveling days. Didn't miss it none then. Still don't.
AID00121653	Tell me about yourself, Doc.
AID00121654	VCG01DocMitchellTownInfo
AID00121655	Well, there's a general store just up the road. Run by a fella named Chet. He don't got nothing fancy, but he's got your basics covered.
AID00121656	If you're looking to wet your whistle, just past Chet's is the Prospector Saloon. The bartender there, Trudy, knows everyone in town.
AID00121657	Other than that, there's not much to see. Just people trying to scratch out a living.
AID00121658	What else can you tell me about Goodsprings?
AID00121659	Well, there's a general store just up the road. Run by a fella named Chet. He don't got nothing fancy, but he's got your basics covered.
AID00121660	If you're looking to wet your whistle, just past Chet's is the Prospector Saloon. The bartender there, Trudy, knows everyone in town.
AID00121661	Other than that, there's not much to see. Just people trying to scratch out a living.
AID00121662	Could you give me the rundown on Goodsprings one more time?
AID00121663	What town is this?
AID00121664	This here's Goodsprings. Named after the water we got here, just down the road to the southeast. Goodsprings Source, they call it.
AID00121665	It's a quiet town, and that's how we like it. We don't go looking for trouble, though occasionally it sees fit to come looking for us.
AID00121666	Do you know anything about the man that shot me?
AID00121667	I didn't see him or the men with him. You might ask around town, though. Could be someone saw which way they was headed.
AID00121668	Your best bet would probably be Trudy, the bartender at the saloon up the road. If anyone saw anything, she'd know about it.
AID00121669	VCG01DocMitchellWhoRescued
AID00121670	That'd be Victor. Curious fella. Sort of odd. And I don't just mean 'cause he's a robot. I couldn't tell you much about him.
AID00121671	He's real friendly, don't get me wrong. You just get the sense that ain't the whole picture. Just a feeling.
AID00121672	Keeps to himself, mostly. You want to know more about him, you'll have to ask him yourself. He has a shack on the southern edge of town.
AID00121673	Who was it that rescued me?
AID00121674	Yeah, you've been a real bundle of laughs.
AID00121675	Yeah, right. Bitch.
AID00121676	Yeah, right. Dick.
AID00121677	Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?
AID00121678	I doubt it. Poindexter might have an idea for some kind of last-minute scheme. You should talk to him.
AID00121679	Tell me more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00121680	It's been in business for a very long time, and is probably the biggest trading outfit in California.
AID00121681	There's a branch up in New Vegas, but it hasn't been doing so well. Word is that the big boss herself, Alice McLafferty, is coming in to fix things.
AID00121682	Can you tell me anything about Goodsprings?
AID00121683	I've never stopped here until recently. You're better off asking one of the locals.
AID00121684	If you insist.
AID00121685	Seems a little light for the work I did.
AID00121686	It's all I've got with me, but if you look me up at the Crimson Caravan's main camp in New Vegas, I'll pay you in full.
AID00121687	How did you happen to find me?
AID00121688	I was out for a stroll that night when I heard the commotion up at the old bone orchard. Saw what looked like a bunch of bad eggs so I laid low.
AID00121689	Once they'd run off, I dug you up to see if you were still kicking. Turns out, you were, so I hauled you off to the Doc right quick.
AID00121690	Thanks for digging me out of that grave.
AID00121691	Don't mention it! I'm always ready to lend a helping hand to a stranger in need.
AID00121692	Goodbye.
AID00121693	Happy trails!
AID00121694	Keep dreaming. That plane's never going to fly.
AID00121695	As I said, repairing and flying the bomber is our destiny. It's that simple.
AID00121696	I guess you could start the engines underwater and hop it up onto shore...
AID00121697	[FAILED] I'm not a mechanic, but after 300 years I don't think those engines would just start up.
AID00121698	You could attach ballast to the plane and then haul it here for repairs...
AID00121699	[SUCCEEDED] Yes! In fact, that's exactly what Loyal has planned to do. You should go talk to him!
AID00121700	I look forward to seeing the old bomber fly.
AID00121701	It'll be spectacular, won't it? You should talk to Loyal. I bet you could help.
AID00121702	Simulators, ha! That's a crash waiting to happen!
AID00121703	I can see how you think that, since you don't know what you're talking about.
AID00121704	Oh, to flap one's arms and plunge bird-like headlong and skybound...
AID00121705	[FAILED] Your attempt at poetry, is... uh, beautiful, certainly. But it doesn't really work like that. Flying, I mean.
AID00121706	Oh, to slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance amid the soaring birds...
AID00121707	[SUCCEEDED] That's beautiful! Yes, it's exactly like that, so free, so... words can't do it justice.
AID00121708	Of course. You wouldn't want outsiders learning to fly.
AID00121709	Thank you for being so understanding.
AID00121710	Yeah, you people are coo-koo for things that go boom.
AID00121711	There's nothing wrong with our interest in explosive ordnance. It's kept the savages out. Until today, at least.
AID00121712	You folks would sell your souls for some artillery! You just love the stuff!
AID00121713	[FAILED] I think it would be an exaggeration to imply that our interest in explosive ordnance is at odds with our integrity...
AID00121714	That howitzer battery is a monument to the grit and resolve of your people.
AID00121715	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you so much! I'll be sure to pass that on.
AID00121716	Your people are a determined bunch.
AID00121717	Yes, there's just about nothing we won't do to get our hands on some explosive ordnance!
AID00121718	I guess poor nutrition could explain a lot of your behavior.
AID00121719	Our nutrition is not deficient! We supplement our diet of grains and vegetables with soy and legumes for protein.
AID00121720	But where do you get protein? Oh my god! You're all *cannibals!*
AID00121721	[FAILED] We are certainly not cannibals! We're not savages, like some people!
AID00121722	We supplement grains and green vegetables with soy and legumes - that's how we get our protein!
AID00121723	You must cultivate soy or legumes for protein, in addition to grains.
AID00121724	[SUCCEEDED] Indeed we do! Very impressive.
AID00121725	The ingenuity of your people is remarkable.
AID00121726	Thank you. Our self-sufficiency is a point of pride.
AID00121727	Kind of stupid, making a radioactive scrapheap your home.
AID00121728	For your information, our people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault. The radiation levels here were within safe limits.
AID00121729	Also for your information, Nellis is not a scrapheap! We repaired most of the damage here long ago. Nellis is comfy!
AID00121730	But your people were mutants, immune to the radiation!
AID00121731	[FAILED] Uh... no. We'd just brought devices called Geiger counters with us from the vault, that's all. The radiation levels were safe.
AID00121732	Whereas your people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault.
AID00121733	[SUCCEEDED] That's exactly right! You're very knowledgeable for a sav - an outsider!
AID00121734	But a little radiation didn't keep your people away!
AID00121735	That's right! Our Geiger counter indicated that the base was radioactive, but not dangerously so. Enough time has passed.
AID00121736	You people are really crazy about blowing stuff up!
AID00121737	Keep that opinion to yourself when visiting Nellis, outsider. It makes you sound ignorant.
AID00121738	Yeah, I *love* it when I throw a grenade and it goes BANG!
AID00121739	[FAILED] Um, that's nice, but it's not really the scale of explosion that interests us...
AID00121740	Yeah, any detonation with a yield of less than a half-ton of TNT is boring.
AID00121741	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly! We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but besides that, to heck with nitpicky restrictions!
AID00121742	Your people were willing to risk it all for freedom.
AID00121743	And at Nellis, we found it. We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but otherwise it's do as you will!
AID00121744	I'm looking to make myself useful. Who needs help around here?
AID00121745	Gosh, there's a lot of folks. Argyll's our doctor - he could use help tending to any injured we got.
AID00121746	Over at the workshop, Loyal and Jack are always building something - though Loyal may not be too happy to see your kind running around Nellis.
AID00121747	Raquel's our Master-At-Arms. I'm sure you've met her. There was a problem with some giant ants a while ago. She might want you to look into it.
AID00121748	That's enough history for now.
AID00121749	All right. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?
AID00121750	How did you learn where to find an old bomber?
AID00121751	Loyal found a file somewhere on the base, with magazine articles, photographs, a map, even.
AID00121752	It seems that a bomber, apparently the 29th of its kind, crashed in Lake Mead on July 21st, 1948. Just imagine - that's over 300 years ago!
AID00121753	The photographs showed that it was basically intact, and the map tells us exactly where to find it. Except we haven't left Nellis in decades.
AID00121754	How has Nellis taught your people to fly?
AID00121755	Once we restored power, we learned that some elaborate chairs we'd been sleeping in were actually virtual reality simulators.
AID00121756	We believe they were used to train combat pilots. We use them extensively. I alone have shot down over 500 Chinese Xian-85 fighters!
AID00121757	Before you ask, I'm afraid there's no way you can be allowed to use the simulators. They are for our use only. Sorry.
AID00121758	What are howitzers doing at an Air Force Base?
AID00121759	You're right, they weren't here when we discovered Nellis! We found the guns at a huge weapon depot called Area 2, many miles from here!
AID00121760	It took many weeks to drag the guns and their ammunition back to Nellis - and it was the last time any of us set foot beyond our homeland!
AID00121761	Why did your ancestors leave the safety of a vault?
AID00121762	So you know about the vaults! Yes, we lived in one of those. Ours was numbered 34.
AID00121763	In our vault, everyone had guns - but the overseer wouldn't let you fire off any of the really fun ones.
AID00121764	I guess all the little pops and bangs at the firing ranges just got boring after a while!
AID00121765	How do you survive, totally cut off from the world?
AID00121766	Nellis is a completely self-sufficient community! We draw water from Lake Mead, solar arrays provide power, and we grow our own crops!
AID00121767	I'm surprised Nellis was empty when your people found it.
AID00121768	Several atomic warheads detonated here hundreds of years ago, leaving the base highly radioactive.
AID00121769	The savages of the wastes, ignoramuses, all avoided Nellis by habit.
AID00121770	Another time, maybe.
AID00121771	If you're interested in knowing more about us, it seems like you'd be pretty amazed by the mural. Is there something else?
AID00121772	Sure, I can spare the time.
AID00121773	Excellent. Imagine - you're the first outsider ever to hear our tale! <clears throat>
AID00121774	Goodbye.
AID00121775	Goodbye.
AID00121776	Yep, thanks for the compliment. Bye!
AID00121777	Aren't you forgetting... nevermind. Goodbye.
AID00121778	<Lie> Make it 700 caps or I'll tell the Boomers to adjust their trajectory.
AID00121779	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain. Here you go. Have a nice  day.
AID00121780	[FAILED] No deal, here's what we agreed upon.
AID00121781	I think it deserves closer to 1000 caps.
AID00121782	[FAILED] No deal, here's what we agreed upon.
AID00121783	I think it deserves closer to 1000 caps.
AID00121784	That was X caps.
AID00121785	Sorry about that, poor memory. Here you go.
AID00121786	That was 600 caps.
AID00121787	Sorry about that, poor memory. Here you go.
AID00121788	That was 400 caps.
AID00121789	I believe you said you would double my money.
AID00121790	Yep, here are your caps.
AID00121791	What was the deal again?
AID00121792	<Speech>
AID00121793	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, simmer down. I'll tell you. I'm a gambler and a scavenger.
AID00121794	I've made some cash from gambling, and some cash from... reclaiming goods that are no longer being used. Now do you want my help or not?
AID00121795	You can tell me, or you can tell the underside of my boot.
AID00121796	[FAILED] Who am I and what I am doing is my business. Now are you in the market for info or not?
AID00121797	Who the hell are you?
AID00121798	<Barter>
AID00121799	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I suppose I can cut you a deal, but not a cap lower. I gotta make a living here.
AID00121800	Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
AID00121801	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, I'll pay double your wager if you make it back.
AID00121802	300 caps? I'm a bit short right now. How about 200?
AID00121803	[FAILED] No deal. My info, my price.
AID00121804	300 caps?! 50 sounds like a fair price.
AID00121805	<Pay 300 caps> You've got yourself a bet.
AID00121806	Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
AID00121807	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, there's 600 caps in it if you make it.
AID00121808	300 caps? Too rich for my blood.
AID00121809	Wager? Let's hear it.
AID00121810	Well, I know the secret to get past. If you give me the caps, I'll tell you.
AID00121811	If you make it back alive I'll double your money!
AID00121812	Goodbye.
AID00121813	Bye.
AID00121814	Let's talk about something else.
AID00121815	Okay.
AID00121816	<Science skill>
AID00121817	[SUCCEEDED] That's a brilliant idea! I can put that together right now...
AID00121818	Here you go, a new rebreather!
AID00121819	Corn silk, rubber hose, and removable adhesive would make a good hermetic seal.
AID00121820	[FAILED] Sorry, there is no way it would withstand submersion. Has to be watertight. Past few times I've tested it I've gotten a mouthful of water.
AID00121821	A pressure cooker would have the gaskets and valving I need to seal it up.
AID00121822	Aw c'mon, it looks fine. I bet the seal will hold.
AID00121823	I have one right here.
AID00121824	Thanks, this will just take a few moments...
AID00121825	Okay, it looks like the valve from the cooker was a perfect fit. Here is the rebreather.
AID00121826	Not yet.
AID00121827	Okay, well let me know when you do.
AID00121828	I need to get to Primm. Can you suggest a route?
AID00121829	Sure can. Take the road southeast out of town till it hits the freeway. Primm is the town with the roller coaster, straight south. Can't miss it.
AID00121830	NCR patrols do a good job of keeping the highway clear, but I'd keep your gun where you can reach it easily. You never know who you'll run into.
AID00121831	Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife. My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.
AID00121832	Could you me tell the story of the mural again?
AID00121833	You want to hear it again? Of course! I did a good job the first time, huh?
AID00121834	Goodbye.
AID00121835	Yeah.
AID00121836	How did you end up in Goodsprings?
AID00121837	I moseyed into town, oh, ten, fifteen years ago? Before that, I... hmmm, I can't quite seem to recall. Odd.
AID00121838	Anyway, it's a right peaceful town and I reckon it's as fine a place to settle as any.
AID00121839	Do you know who those men were who attacked me?
AID00121840	Can't say that I'm familiar with the rascals. Some of the fine folks in town might be able to help you out with that.
AID00121841	I think I can handle a few ants without a sonic emitter.
AID00121842	I guess you'll have to use hit and run tactics, and go see Doc Argyll if you need patching up. Good luck.
AID00121843	Yes. He was sabotaging the Army to force the NCR to go home.
AID00121844	Well that don't make no sense. We came all this way; why don't he want to stay? It's nice here.
AID00121845	Yes, but it's a classified secret. Don't tell anybody.
AID00121846	Oh, don't worry! I won't!
AID00121847	Yes, it's true. I don't know why.
AID00121848	Some folks just ain't cut out for Army life, I guess.
AID00121849	He was sabotaging the NCR's war efforts to force a retreat back to California.
AID00121850	Are you serious? No way! I don't believe it!
AID00121851	I'm afraid it's classified.
AID00121852	Classified? Shit, it must be really big then.
AID00121853	I don't, sorry.
AID00121854	Oh, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
AID00121855	If you're so opposed to the NCR's expansion, why not do something about it?
AID00121856	Do you know anything about the people who attacked me?
AID00121857	The leader was a New Vegas-type, typical city boy. He had a bunch of Great Khans with him, probably hired guns.
AID00121858	The Great Khans normally stay in their own territory way up northwest, on account of them being enemies with the NCR.

AID00121866	The Sunset Sarsaparilla Company has received a number of complaints regarding the prize awarded for handing in Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
AID00121867	Therefore, we have seen fit to provide another prize that we feel will placate the most discriminating customer.
AID00121868	Just head through the double doors and follow the hallway to your left to the very end. An attendant will be there to present your prize, directly.
AID00121869	We at the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company would once again like to thank you for your patronage.
AID00121870	Um, what? Is that it?
AID00121871	SSHQFestusWheresThePrize
AID00121872	The Sunset Sarsaparilla Company has received a number of complaints regarding the prize awarded for handing in Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
AID00121873	Therefore, we have seen fit to provide another prize that we feel will placate the most discriminating customer.
AID00121874	Just head through the double doors and follow the hallway to your left to the very end. An attendant will be there to present your prize, directly.
AID00121875	We at the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company would once again like to thank you for your patronage.
AID00121876	What the hell? Where's the real prize?
AID00121877	Thanks for the caps.
AID00121878	You're welcome. So, can I get you anything?
AID00121879	I fixed your radio.
AID00121880	Yep, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
AID00121881	Want me to take a look at your broken radio?
AID00121882	Sure. The outside looks okay, but I think something broke on the inside.
AID00121883	There'd be caps in it for you. I do like to hear what's going on in the world. And that Mr. New Vegas seems like such a gentleman.
AID00121884	I'm trying to track down the people who attacked me. Know anything about them?
AID00121885	Not much, other than they're a bunch of freeloaders who expected a few rounds on the house. I was able to get them to pay up, though.
AID00121886	Of course, one of the Great Khans did knock my radio to the floor "by accident," and it hasn't been working since.
AID00121887	A man named Joe Cobb was looking for you, but I killed him.
AID00121888	Err, thanks, I guess. Cobb wasn't the problem, though - I could've handled him if he ever found me.
AID00121889	Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I fight can them all.
AID00121890	How long has he been in Goodsprings?
AID00121891	It was here when I took over the saloon seven years ago. Some people have said its owner lived here, but no one knows who it was.
AID00121892	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00121893	Fine by me.
AID00121894	You don't like him?
AID00121895	It acts friendly enough, but I don't trust that whole "cheerful cowboy" act. I find it all very creepy.
AID00121896	What does he actually do around here?
AID00121897	Other than rolling around once in awhile, it doesn't do anything useful as far as I can tell.
AID00121898	I don't know why it took an interest in you, but I'd be careful. It's never helped anyone before.
AID00121899	Do you know the robot that rescued me?
AID00121900	I know that... thing... as much as anyone else around here. It mostly keeps to itself, which is just fine by me.
AID00121901	Good riddance to it is all I have to say. Never liked having it around.
AID00121902	I've never seen a robot like you before.
AID00121903	I'm a Securitron, RobCo security model 2060-B. If you ever see any of my brothers, tell them Victor says howdy.
AID00121904	Have you ever been to New Vegas?
AID00121905	Twice. Both times, I drank a lot of liquor and lost most of my caps at the card tables. In that order, now that I think about it.
AID00121906	If you ever get to New Vegas, be sure to visit Gomorrah. It's the best casino in the city. You won't regret it.
AID00121907	Word of advice - behave. Between the NCR military police and Mr. House's robots, you don't want to be causing trouble on the Strip.
AID00121908	I repaired the solar arrays and increased their efficiency.
AID00121909	An impressive piece of work. I'll keep that in mind if jobs come up in the future.
AID00121910	Didn't I hear you say something earlier about not being able to pay me now?
AID00121911	I did have what was left of the Crimson Caravan money, but I wasn't sure if it was my right to just give it away.
AID00121912	I owe you more than that, though, so look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp up in New Vegas if you ever visit.
AID00121913	[END TUTORIAL] I've had enough of geckos for one day.
AID00121914	I don't blame you. They're good eating, but that's about it.
AID00121915	Sure, I'll come with you.
AID00121916	Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Especially with two of us.
AID00121917	Come with me.
AID00121918	[END TUTORIAL] I think I've learned enough.
AID00121919	Suit yourself. Hope this helped you some.
AID00121920	Okay, I'm in.
AID00121921	Follow me. It's just down to the southeast a short ways.
AID00121922	VCG02SunnyShotReaction
AID00121923	That's the right idea. Look down the sight.
AID00121924	Try crouching down and staying still. It'll help your aim.
AID00121925	Nice shot.
AID00121926	VCG02SunnyBark
AID00121927	Now, see those sarsaparilla bottles on that fence there? Take this and try to hit a couple of 'em.
AID00121928	Okay, you're on. Go give 'em hell.
AID00121929	Doc Mitchell said you could teach me to survive in the desert.
AID00121930	Yeah, I guess there's a thing or two I could show you. Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.
AID00121931	Meet me outside, behind the saloon.
AID00121932	Staying because you want to or because you have to? This is a good hiding spot.
AID00121933	[SUCCEEDED] That is a pretty flimsy story, I guess. The real reason that I'm staying is because there's a group of men out to kill me.
AID00121934	Is that the story you're going to stick with?
AID00121935	[FAILED] Look, I don't know you, so what I'm doing here isn't any of your business.
AID00121936	Never mind. I want to talk about something else.
AID00121937	All right.
AID00121938	Did you ever find anything good while prospecting?
AID00121939	Nope. Had a pretty good claim once, way out east by the river, but got run off by Raiders. Eventually, got too old to keep going out.
AID00121940	What do you use the Bighorners for?
AID00121941	Meat and hide, mostly. Can't put a pack on 'em - they just lay down until you take it off.
AID00121942	Can find a bunch of wild ones high up in the hills, but gotta be careful around 'em. They can put up a decent fight if cornered.
AID00121943	HVTorresWhatDoYouDo
AID00121944	Sorry, I haven't found it yet.
AID00121945	Then we have nothing further to talk about.
AID00121946	I've got it right here.
AID00121947	Oh thank god. Hardin was about to start an inquiry into the whole affair, and more than a few heads would have rolled as a result.
AID00121948	Since you helped me, I'll tell you what. I work on some of our busted weapons in my spare time, so I have a few pieces that are kept off the books.
AID00121949	Here, take this. I hope it comes in handy.
AID00121950	So what happened?
AID00121951	You were the last one to check out the missing laser pistol, right?
AID00121952	Oh man, I told Watkins this wasn't going to work.
AID00121953	Look, Watkins and I snuck out one day. She said it'd be a training exercise.
AID00121954	Said she heard from a guy on one of the patrols that there was a gulch just southeast of here with scorpions in it, and that we had to check it out.
AID00121955	There were scorpions out there, all right. We started using them for target practice, but before we knew it the damn things were all around us.
AID00121956	So we made a run for it, and in all the commotion, I dropped my pistol. Watkins keeps urging me to go back and get it, but that's not gonna happen.
AID00121957	You can go outside, though, can't you? You could return the pistol to Torres and clear this whole thing up for me.
AID00121958	HVShootingRangeAskAboutMissingWeapon
AID00121959	Torres must be getting desperate if she's accepting help on this one. I'll tell you what I told her.
AID00121960	My records show that Initiate Stanton was the last to check it out, but checked it back in a day later.
AID00121961	Do you know anything about a weapon that's gone missing?
AID00121962	HVShootingRangeAllowed
AID00121963	Sure. The elder's already given the okay. Unfortunately, you'll have to use your own weapons and ammo.
AID00121964	I'm allowed to use the range?

AID00121971	<Press the red Hold button.>
AID00121972	I'd hold on 21 too, heh heh. Looks like ol' Festus needs a miracle now, eh?
AID00121973	<Press the red Hold button.>
AID00121974	Okay, pardner. Guess it's up to me to catch up.
AID00121975	<Press the red Hold button.>
AID00121976	SSHQLHFestusDraw
AID00121977	Ol' Festus is still holding. You go again, pardner.
AID00121978	Ol' Festus thinks he's got this won. I'm holding.
AID00121979	Ol' Festus is gonna draw.
AID00121980	Looks like I got an ace, pardner.
AID00121981	Looks like I got a two, pardner.

AID00121998	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
AID00121999	Your turn, pardner. Draw, hold, or quit?
AID00122000	Looks like I win, pardner. You did well, but ol' Festus did a bit better, hee hee.
AID00122001	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you've had enough of ol' Festus' boots stompin all over ya, say "I'm done".
AID00122002	Lucky horseshoes! I just nudged your total up one, pardner. No hard feelings, right?
AID00122003	You're holding, so ol' Festus'll just go again.
AID00122004	Drat, ol' Festus needs more than that to catch you.
AID00122005	Tarnation, ol' Festus's seen three-legged cattle move faster than this hand!
AID00122006	Let's see, you're at 21, so ol' Festus knows you want to hit. Just kidding, heh heh.
AID00122007	See that? Ol' Festus is an old hand at this.
AID00122008	Are you still there, pardner? Ol' Festus can hardly see you, you're so far behind!
AID00122009	Twenty-one! Just where ol' Festus wants to be. Beat that, pardner!
AID00122010	You're doing well, but ol' Festus isn't out of this yet.
AID00122011	Ol' Festus must be getting old. You're leaving me in the dust.
AID00122012	Well, I'll be. That makes twenty-one for you, pardner.
AID00122013	You'll have to toss better than that, pardner!
AID00122014	Ol' Festus doesn't like your chances, pardner.
AID00122015	Ol' Festus is fine staying at twenty-one.
AID00122016	<Press the blue button to draw a card.>

AID00122036	Looks like you win, pardner. Ol' Festus just couldn't match those keen skills of yours. Here's your reward.
AID00122037	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you're done humiliating poor ol' Festus at his own game, say "I'm done".
AID00122038	Lucky horseshoes! You just nudged ol' Festus' total up one. Don't worry, I won't hold it against you, heh heh.
AID00122039	Excellent treatment. I hadn't thought of that!
AID00122040	I thought that man was done for, but you brought him around.
AID00122041	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
AID00122042	Are you going to confiscate my weapons?
AID00122043	Confiscate your weapons? Certainly not! Personal armament is the foundation of social trust and responsibility.
AID00122044	I think I'll be leaving.
AID00122045	Unacceptable. You've made it this far, probed our defenses, seen our faces.
AID00122046	Mother Pearl's invitation is mandatory, not optional.
AID00122047	I told you, Mother Pearl's invitation is not optional.
AID00122048	Who is Mother Pearl?
AID00122049	As I said, she is our Eldest. Mother Pearl has lived at Nellis from the start, and has the wisdom of her age.
AID00122050	She said this day would come, and that any savage to reach our gates should be brought to her.
AID00122051	Do you know anything about Victor?
AID00122052	The machine? Harmless, no matter what Trudy says. She thinks it's hiding something, but I think it's just a broken down relic with no place to be.
AID00122053	Figures. Someone shut you down deliberately, but there's no record of who.
AID00122054	That's a puzzle, all right. I'm sure it's nothing.
AID00122055	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
AID00122056	Override Command 16-Delta. Does that mean anything to you?
AID00122057	Never heard of it.
AID00122058	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
AID00122059	Interesting. It looks like an override command was activated.
AID00122060	Override? That can't be right. Probably just a malfunctioning tube somewhere.
AID00122061	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
AID00122062	Didn't you hear all the gunfire?
AID00122063	Didn't hear a thing. I guess I dozed off there for a minute.
AID00122064	They were here. The fight's over.
AID00122065	Really? I must've dozed off. Although, that's never happened before.
AID00122066	Some good you were. You didn't even show up to the fight.
AID00122067	Now just hold on! I meant it when I said I'd help you. I guess I must've dozed off. That's never happened before.
AID00122068	Are you decent in a fight? I could use more firepower, if you have any.
AID00122069	Trouble with rustlers? Count me in, pardner. Those varmints will be running home with their tails between their legs soon enough.
AID00122070	You mean you were expecting me? Like a prophecy or something?
AID00122071	Prophecy? Do we look like a bunch of religious idiots?
AID00122072	I just hoped a savage - outsider, sorry - would make it to our gates before one of those armies out there comes knocking.
AID00122073	That's right, child. Mother Pearl knows a storm is gathering. Times are changing. May be time for us to change a little, too.
AID00122074	You didn't exactly roll out a red carpet!
AID00122075	Those howitzers of ours aren't just for entertainment, child! Explosive ordnance is what keeps the savages at a distance.
AID00122076	Except you! There's something special about you, child, and it was the howitzers that gave you a chance to show it!
AID00122077	VCG02SettlerBark
AID00122078	Help!
AID00122079	There's too many!
AID00122080	Get 'em off!
AID00122081	So where were they headed?
AID00122082	I didn't hear exactly, but the leader was talking about the Strip.
AID00122083	Fella wants to get there and avoid the 15, he'd have to go east. Take Highway 93 up.
AID00122084	Why is that?
AID00122085	That whole area's overrun with the kind of critters that just get mad if you shoot 'em.
AID00122086	Merchants avoid that whole stretch of I-15 like it's radioactive. Which it could be for all I know.
AID00122087	Did my attackers say where they were going?
AID00122088	They were having some kind of argument about it, but the guy in the checkered coat kept shushing them.
AID00122089	Sounded like they came in from the north through Quarry Junction. If that's the case I can't say I blame them for not wanting to go back.
AID00122090	I wanted to ask you some questions.
AID00122091	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk. Preferably somewhere where I can get a stiff drink and Cheyenne can keep cool.
AID00122092	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk.
AID00122093	Fire away.
AID00122094	I ran out of ammo.
AID00122095	Yep, I'd say you're getting a little trigger happy there. Try to slow down a bit. Concentrate on hitting your target.
AID00122096	Here. Go easy on it, now. Ammo can be hard to come by out here.
AID00122097	I have to go.
AID00122098	No time for strangers, huh? I should probably follow your example. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
AID00122099	Who are you?
AID00122100	VFreeformGoodspringsDocMitchellShootoutBags
AID00122101	I ain't got much, but it'll do you more good out there than it will in here. Take what I got.
AID00122102	They'll be using explosives. Do you have something for more serious injuries?
AID00122103	The town is going to be attacked by bandits. Anything you can do to help?
AID00122104	Seems like wherever I go it's always the same. Folks just never leave each other alone.
AID00122105	I'm not much good in a fight, with my bum leg. And my supplies are scarce. But I'll give you what I can spare.
AID00122106	Here are three Stimpaks.
AID00122107	This'll make you feel better.
AID00122108	Powder gangers?
AID00122109	Chain gangs, really. The NCR brought them in from California to work on the rail lines.
AID00122110	Problem is, it turns out that giving convicts a bunch of dynamite and blasting powder isn't the best idea.
AID00122111	Was a big escape not too long ago. Some of 'em stuck together so they could make trouble. That's what we're dealing with now.
AID00122112	Who was that man you were arguing with?
AID00122113	He's a convict. Just without the chains. Said his name was Cobb. "Powder Gangers" is what they call themselves. Plenty more like him out there.
AID00122114	These Great Khans might have something of mine - a Platinum Chip.
AID00122115	Once the Great Khans have been killed or captured, you're welcome to retrieve any property they've taken from you.
AID00122116	But I already got a tattoo with your name on it. Want to see it?
AID00122117	I think you're mistaking me for someone else.
AID00122118	Great, neither am I. Glad we cleared that up.
AID00122119	I can't do this right now.
AID00122120	I see... well, if you change your mind and want to earn some caps, let me know.
AID00122121	What do you need help with?
AID00122122	I have the delightful task of tabulating stockpiles, kill ratios, mission success rates, radiation deaths, and other truly fascinating numbers.
AID00122123	I've come across numerous inconsistencies between our numbers and our reports - especially with regards to intercepting hostiles.
AID00122124	I'm wondering if our radio security codes have been compromised. I need someone to deliver security code upgrades to each of the Ranger stations.
AID00122125	You think someone is listening in on your broadcasts?
AID00122126	Less than a third of reported enemy sightings are getting intercepted. Either our intel is faulty, or our enemies are one step ahead of us.
AID00122127	You'd think the NCR would be very concerned about this sort of thing.
AID00122128	I've been trying to get someone to authorize this update - or at the least get field clearance to leave the camp and do this myself.
AID00122129	But nobody takes me seriously - they just think I'm an incompetent desk jockey trying to glamorize the importance of my job.
AID00122130	Why is the Big Horn off limits to troopers?
AID00122131	The workers here don't much like the military. After too many fights and broken noses, the NCR doesn't allow troops to spend time here.
AID00122132	That doesn't stop a few people like yourself, of course. Don't worry, I won't say a word.
AID00122133	I'm not a trooper. I just happen to be wearing the armor.
AID00122134	Oh. Well, you'd better not let any of the real troopers hear that - and, of course, they won't be hearing it from me, neither.
AID00122135	So, what brings you to Boulder City? Not many people come here.
AID00122136	The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
AID00122137	Then we are out of here. Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AID00122138	FSRotfaceWhatKindofTip
AID00122139	You look like you're new around here, so I'm sure I know all sorts of things you'd find useful. If not, well, it's only a cap.
AID00122140	So what do you say?
AID00122141	What kind of tip?
AID00122142	FSRotfaceSoliciting
AID00122143	Ha ha ha, oh that's rich. You're not exactly my type, no offense. No, I meant I could give you a tip. Earn my money, so to speak.
AID00122144	Are you soliciting me?
AID00122145	Sorry, maybe another time.
AID00122146	I understand. Well, have a good day.
AID00122147	Sure, here you go.
AID00122148	The first thing you should know is that Freeside is run by a pack of yahoos that call themselves the Kings.
AID00122149	Their leader, who oddly enough calls himself the King, currently has his hands full trying to prevent an all-out riot in Freeside.
AID00122150	That's two tips, but what the hell. You're a new customer so the extra one's on me. Wanna hear another?
AID00122151	Northwest of the big Freeside sign is a casino called the Atomic Wrangler.
AID00122152	It's not as fancy as the ones on the Strip, but there's still plenty of excitement to be found there.
AID00122153	At the northwest end of Fremont Street you'll find the Silver Rush. It's run by a rather scary family called the Van Graffs.
AID00122154	Trust me, these are not people you want to mess with. But if lasers and such are your thing, the goods they sell are second to none.
AID00122155	People in Freeside generally fall into one of two categories. Those who've been here all their lives call themselves Locals.
AID00122156	When people from the NCR and other places started pouring in, the Locals began referring to them as Squatters, and the name stuck.
AID00122157	The Locals blame the Squatters for the scarcity of resources in Freeside, and the Squatters blame any act of violence against them on the Locals.
AID00122158	They're both right to some extent, and violent outbreaks between the two are all too common these days.
AID00122159	If you've been around the Kings, you may have met one of them named Pacer. He's always stomping around trying show off his authority.
AID00122160	Being new, you weren't around when it happened, but a few months ago Pacer pissed off the Van Graff family big time.
AID00122161	No one knows what went down, but word is the Van Graffs still want him dead.
AID00122162	Drugs are everywhere in Freeside, and even people you might not expect have become addicts.
AID00122163	Jacob Hoff, for instance. That man was a brilliant chemist before he picked up the habit. Now, just another junkie.
AID00122164	That King Pacer's a fan of Jet, too, though I heard one of the Followers talking about it being dangerous for him. Something about his heart.
AID00122165	Do yourself a favor, and stay away from that stuff, okay?
AID00122166	In the area between the north and east gates is the Old Mormon Fort, where the Followers of the Apocalypse have set themselves up.
AID00122167	The Followers aren't a bad bunch, and provide healing and supplies to the people of Freeside as they can.
AID00122168	I've heard the Garrets over at the Atomic Wrangler are having a hard time collecting some money owed to them.
AID00122169	An enterprising person like yourself might be able to make some caps helping them with their little problem.
AID00122170	Caught a rumor the other day that some of the clientele over at the Wrangler have been making some rather strange requests.
AID00122171	Stuff like weirdos wanting the, ahem, services of ghouls and such. I almost have half a mind to volunteer myself, sexy beast that I am.
AID00122172	Have you tried going to the Strip, only to be stopped by those big metal murder machines? Happens every day around here.
AID00122173	But if you know the right people, you can get through the gate without being a rich man.
AID00122174	I probably don't have to tell you that Freeside's dangerous, but you might want to think twice about hiring one of those guards at the gates.
AID00122175	They're not all saints, is all I'm saying.
AID00122176	Have you been to Mick & Ralph's yet? They run a store just down the street, and sell some things you might not expect.
AID00122177	There's a guy out on the main drag who sells second hand adventuring gear. He's got an okay selection, but where does it come from?
AID00122178	He might not look it, but Ralph from Mick & Ralph's is no slouch with a keyboard. I've heard he's helped reprogram several robots in his time.
AID00122179	Saw a strange thing the other day. The King took that robo-dog of his over to the Old Mormon Fort.
AID00122180	Weird thing was that the dog was flipping out, and had to be restrained by a few of the King's men. Hope he doesn't get loose.
AID00122181	Things have generally been bad here for the Squatters, the people who came here hoping for a better life and just got stuck.
AID00122182	But lately the mood has changed. The Squatters seem to be a bit more optimistic. I wonder what happened?
AID00122183	Mention the NCR and people around here get a little on edge. There's talk that they're going to take over all of New Vegas.
AID00122184	It doesn't help that they've got military camps all over the place, and more troops pour into the area daily.
AID00122185	There's a rumor that a huge army is camped to the east, massing to attack the NCR. Like that'd ever happen.
AID00122186	Who in the world could stand up to the NCR and win?
AID00122187	While everyone knows Mr. House runs New Vegas, no one knows the first thing about him.
AID00122188	He just sort of showed up a few years back, and everything you see around you is the result. Just who in the hell is he?
AID00122189	The Strip is run by the Three Families, who owe their allegiance to Mr. House.
AID00122190	When he first showed up, he gave the local tribes the choice of working with him or getting the hell out of his way.
AID00122191	Given how things turned out, I know which way I'd have gone, but hindsight's twenty-twenty, right?
AID00122192	The Omertas, one of Mr. House's Three Families, run a casino called Gomorrah on the Strip.
AID00122193	If you thought the Wrangler was something, you owe it to yourself to go there.
AID00122194	The Chairmen run a casino on the Strip called the Tops. It's a pretty classy place, by all reports.
AID00122195	I haven't been there myself, but I hear security there is kinda tight. Don't expect to bring your weapons in there.
AID00122196	There was a rumor a while back that the White Glove Society was really an all-ghoul gang, which is why they wear those weird masks of theirs.
AID00122197	What do you think, would I look good in a mask? Maybe I'd make more caps...
AID00122198	A traveler that passed through here not long ago told everyone he met that there's some kind of plant paradise to the west where food is abundant.
AID00122199	All the people foolish enough to listen to him and head out that way never came back.
AID00122200	Ever hear of the Gun Runners? They sell just about every kind of firearm you can imagine, and some you probably couldn't.
AID00122201	I've heard people passing through mention some kind of underground fights pitting creatures of the waste against one another for sport.
AID00122202	And when I say "underground," that's their word I'm using, not my own.
AID00122203	East of Freeside there's an old air force base, judging by the road signs.
AID00122204	No one knows for sure what's in there, though, on account of anyone approaching the place getting violently blown up.
AID00122205	I heard something about a town south of here being attacked, but details are sketchy. All I know is there haven't been any refugees showing up here.
AID00122206	Which means either the attack wasn't too bad, or it was very, very bad.
AID00122207	Traders have been griping for a while now about the 15 being too dangerous to travel. I'd steer clear of it unless you're armed to the teeth.
AID00122208	The NCR used to run a prison to the southwest, but something happened a little while back, and now all you'll get is hard looks if you ask about it.
AID00122209	FSBodyguardWhyHire
AID00122210	You could go without one, but you'd be up to your waist in vermin either begging for your caps or demanding it at knifepoint the whole time.
AID00122211	I've got a reputation for shooting first and not really bothering to ask questions later. With me around, the vermin should keep their distance.
AID00122212	So what'll it be? I've already spotted two other potential customers while we've been chatting.
AID00122213	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
AID00122214	New to Freeside, are you? Trust me, you won't make it ten feet without being accosted by some of our more friendly residents.
AID00122215	I happen to have an understanding with most of the local wildlife, however. With me by your side, they'll kindly find someone else to bother.
AID00122216	So you want to run with the best or not?
AID00122217	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
AID00122218	Ah, my friend, believe me when I tell you that this place, while quite nice when you know your way around, can be very, very dangerous.
AID00122219	There are those who would hinder your every step with requests for your money, your business, or even your life.
AID00122220	With your permission, however, I would be happy to stand between you and those people. How does that sound?
AID00122221	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
AID00122222	FSBodyguardReject
AID00122223	It's your funeral. Come see me when you wise up.
AID00122224	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
AID00122225	Are you sure? Well, don't say you weren't warned.
AID00122226	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
AID00122227	I can't say I recommend that, but hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be here if you do. Good luck!
AID00122228	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
AID00122229	FSBodyguardAccept
AID00122230	Wonderful. One thing up front - the moment you leave Freeside, our contract is done. That being said, please, after you.
AID00122231	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
AID00122232	Come back when you have the caps, then. If you'll excuse me, I have more important people to talk to in the meantime.
AID00122233	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
AID00122234	You've made the right choice. As long as you're in Freeside, I'm your man. No one will mess with you with me hanging around.
AID00122235	However, once you head over to the Strip or enter the wasteland, I'm heading immediately back here to pick up another customer.
AID00122236	So what do you say? Ready to head out?
AID00122237	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
AID00122238	Oh, for the love of - get the hell out of here, then!
AID00122239	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
AID00122240	You won't regret it, my friend! As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be right behind you, covering your back.
AID00122241	Oh, I should mention that I don't go where I'm not invited, so don't count on me following you inside private property. Ready to get going?
AID00122242	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
AID00122243	That is most regrettable, my friend. I wish you well in the meantime.
AID00122244	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
AID00122245	FSBodyguard0101
AID00122246	Need a bodyguard?
AID00122247	You got the caps, I got the guns!
AID00122248	These guys couldn't keep fleas off a dog. Hire me!
AID00122249	Protection services for hire over here!
AID00122250	Safe travel through Freeside!
AID00122251	You need the best. Hire me!
AID00122252	Your safety guaranteed!
AID00122253	Freeside's a dangerous place, my friend!
AID00122254	Only I can keep you safe, my friend!
AID00122255	<Lie> Yes, I saw him here in the hotel.
AID00122256	What? Oh, my God! Where?
AID00122257	Could you be more specific? That could be a lot of people.
AID00122258	No, I haven't.
AID00122259	<Sighs> Ain't nobody got one darned piece of news about my boy? Not one lousy speck of information?
AID00122260	Ain't got one Brahmin unaccounted for across a dozen ranches, but I'm here for an hour and my own son just up and disappears on me.
AID00122261	Maybe another time.
AID00122262	That's too bad. If you change your mind, let me know.
AID00122263	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00122264	Just come see me when you've got some supplies to turn in.
AID00122265	What do you need?
AID00122266	Med-X, Rad-Away, and Fixer are Freeside essentials. I can't pay you for any supplies you bring in, but I could discount the charge for our services.
AID00122267	You need medical supplies?
AID00122268	Rates of injury and illness in Freeside are very high. Supplies don't last long.
AID00122269	Any bounty hunting tips for me?
AID00122270	Be quick and quiet, and don't get dead.
AID00122271	Do I look like a career counselor, kid? Get lost.
AID00122272	BCGKExecuteHostage
AID00122273	Say goodbye to the hostage, fucker.
AID00122274	The NCR's coming for us! Waste the hostages!
AID00122275	What goods and services do you have to offer?
AID00122276	We've got liquor, chems, and whores a plenty. Pick your fix and we'll oblige. Our only rule is no sampling the merchandise. Caps paid in advance.
AID00122277	If you'd like to do a bit of gambling, we have an exchange at the back of the casino on the left.
AID00122278	Anything going on around here?
AID00122279	Just the usual. Legion scouts try to slip across the river a couple times a week, but they always end up floating downriver with holes in their heads.
AID00122280	Heck Gunderson said he was here to talk business with you. What business?
AID00122281	What else? Mr. Gunderson and I have been discussing his livestock.
AID00122282	It's put us in rather a delicate position, you see, his coming here. Not that we aren't grateful for his generous offer.
AID00122283	But our executive chef Philippe has transformed brahmin steak into a delicacy. He really is a genius.  Everyone wants it.
AID00122284	But a delicacy is just that - delicate. If everyone can get it, it ceases to be a delicacy. It becomes a perfectly ordinary staple.
AID00122285	And if the Gourmand served staples, it would no longer draw the caliber of people it deserves. It'd be a diner or a... a family restaurant.
AID00122286	So as much as we'd all love for there to be enough steak for everyone, I'm afraid there are more important things to consider.
AID00122287	Do you work here?
AID00122288	I do, but one can hardly call it work. I think of myself as a caretaker rather than a common laborer.
AID00122289	I suppose it is a labor of love if it can be called labor at all.
AID00122290	We at the White Glove Society are all responsible for maintaining the beauty and class of the Ultra-Luxe.
AID00122291	And as its founder I suppose it falls to me to decide how we go about it.
AID00122292	I'm investigating someone else. A man. And he just recently went missing.
AID00122293	A man? Well then this... well this can't be. Two disappearances in my hotel? What will people say?
AID00122294	I'm going to have a word with my staff about security on the premises.
AID00122295	Whether these people are found or not, our guests simply must feel safe in their own rooms.
AID00122296	Is there any way I could talk to the investigator?
AID00122297	Why yes, I think so. If he hasn't checked out yet, that is.
AID00122298	I had our maitre d', Mortimer, offer him a complimentary room for as long as it took for him to be satisfied.
AID00122299	You see? The White Glove Society remains the very picture of courtesy, even in the face of such impolite accusations. We have nothing to hide here.
AID00122300	<Lie> It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
AID00122301	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
AID00122302	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
AID00122303	It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
AID00122304	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
AID00122305	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
AID00122306	Who did you talk to about the disappearance?
AID00122307	There was an investigator who came through here last week. He'd been hired by a young man whose bride-to-be went missing during their stay here.
AID00122308	Well you can already guess what probably happened, can't you? It seems perfectly likely that she got cold feet and ran off.
AID00122309	And that young groom just didn't have a clue, the poor dear.
AID00122310	The White Glove Society used to eat human flesh?
AID00122311	Now didn't I already tell you that we don't do that sort of thing? We do not engage in cannibalism here under any circumstances.
AID00122312	Though we haven't always been the White Glove Society. There was another time, a dark time, when we went by a different name.
AID00122313	But that's all changed now! We've... evolved past such base impulses since settling into our new home. I've seen to it that those days are behind us.
AID00122314	I'm looking for someone who went missing here recently.
AID00122315	This again? I thought all this was settled. I answered every one of that investigator's questions to his satisfaction and gave all the help I could.
AID00122316	I know our reputation hasn't always been spotless, but that's all in the past now. How some people can't get over it is beyond me.
AID00122317	For the last time, the White Glove Society has never and will never consume human flesh for any reason. It's written in the charter.
AID00122318	Sorry. I didn't realize the situation was so serious.
AID00122319	You're dead right it's serious. I ain't seen my son in hours. Don't know where he went.
AID00122320	Folks round here, some of 'em would kill you soon as look at you. His whole life I tried to keep him at the ranch, away from places like this.
AID00122321	Now I take him here and what happens?
AID00122322	He's over in the bathhouse, wearing a skimpy two-piece bathing suit.
AID00122323	What in Creation is the matter with you? Ain't you ever been a parent? Ain't you ever been worried you lost someone?
AID00122324	You got a real sick sense of humor.
AID00122325	Never mind. I was mistaken.
AID00122326	Let me help find your son.
AID00122327	I'd be more than happy to have you. Heck, I'll hire anybody with a pair of legs and at least one good eye at this point.
AID00122328	There'd be a lot of money in it for you if you can get him back to me safe.
AID00122329	And if he ain't, you can bet I'll pay for the names of the sons of bitches responsible.
AID00122330	What business did you have here at the hotel?
AID00122331	That's between me and the White Glove Society.
AID00122332	But let's just say they control the food supply around here, and I got lots of food to give, but that ain't as welcome as you might think.
AID00122333	Did you say something about a white glove?
AID00122334	That's what they call themselves, the folk that run this place. They're the ones dressed all fancy with their bowties and shiny dresses.
AID00122335	Some of 'em got masks, too. Real hard to trust folks like that. Couple of them show their faces and that's who I do my business with.
AID00122336	I don't talk to none of the other ones.
AID00122337	So you're a rancher?
AID00122338	Yep, got a whole mess of brahmins to my name. Bighorners, too.
AID00122339	Used to just have the one ranch, but land was easy to grab before the soldiers moved in.
AID00122340	Before I knew it I was running one of the biggest ranching operations east of California.
AID00122341	Now everywhere I go, folks I never even met shake my hand and call me "Mr. Gunderson." Don't know quite what to make of that.
AID00122342	You lost your son?
AID00122343	My boy, Ted. He was right here. I didn't leave him but a minute. I told him to stay put while I talked some things over with the White Glove folks.
AID00122344	He never was one to stay tied down to a spot, though. Gets that from his mother.
AID00122345	Got most of my staff out looking for him now. I'd be out myself, but I keep hoping he'll show up back here.
AID00122346	Course if he does that I'll whup him till his skinny hide turns to leather for putting me through this. But that don't mean I wouldn't be grateful.
AID00122347	I'd like to help you with your debt collection.
AID00122348	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AID00122349	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
AID00122350	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AID00122351	<Speech more money>
AID00122352	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AID00122353	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here.  50/50 and I'm game.
AID00122354	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AID00122355	Twenty-five percent?!  Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
AID00122356	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00122357	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AID00122358	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
AID00122359	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AID00122360	Eh, sorry.  I've got some other things I need to handle first.
AID00122361	Fair enough. Anything else you need? I'm a busy woman.
AID00122362	What kind of caps are we talking here?
AID00122363	If you bring all of their debts back, we'll give you a cut of each. 25% is more than fair. It would add up to 150 caps if you bring them all in.
AID00122364	That sounds good as long as I don't have to kill anyone.
AID00122365	Will I have to shoot anyone? Because I really want to shoot someone.
AID00122366	I'd prefer you not kill anyone with a debt. It's a bit difficult to collect on a corpse.
AID00122367	Just get the caps from them. After that, I couldn't care less what happens to those deadbeats.
AID00122368	Do you have any work you need done around here?
AID00122369	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
AID00122370	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
AID00122371	Well, with Caleb McCaffery dead, it looks like we could use a new bounty hunter.
AID00122372	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
AID00122373	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
AID00122374	Couldn't we work out a deal?
AID00122375	Nevermind, I changed my mind.
AID00122376	Alright. What can I get you, then?
AID00122377	[Give 10 caps] Here you go.
AID00122378	Up the steps, last room on the left. If you leave the Wrangler, we'll assume you're checking out.
AID00122379	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
AID00122380	I'd like a room.
AID00122381	Just a few caps and it's yours.
AID00122382	You already own the corner room. You don't need to rent another.
AID00122383	You're already renting a room. Sorry, but you can only rent one room at a time.
AID00122384	I'm looking for a little R&R.
AID00122385	Since you're new, I'll lay out the rules for you. The prostitutes here aren't slaves. They decide who they service.
AID00122386	You best make a good first impression if you want what they have to offer.
AID00122387	Rooms are just a few caps a night. Your choice of company is extra, assuming anyone's taken a liking to you.
AID00122388	Rooms are just a few caps a night. Your choice of company is extra, assuming anyone's taken a liking to you.
AID00122389	I'd like to see what you have on tap.
AID00122390	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
AID00122391	I'm not a kid, old man.
AID00122392	You've got a mouth on you, kid. If I weren't busy working for the Garrets, I might give you a few lessons in common courtesy. Get lost.
AID00122393	I'm still working on it.
AID00122394	Very well. Keep me updated.
AID00122395	I'm on an investigation, too. I'm hoping we can help each other.
AID00122396	You are? Nothing so grim as his investigation, I hope.
AID00122397	<Lie> Yes, I have some critical information for him.
AID00122398	Good. I hope that young man gets some closure after all he's been through.
AID00122399	Actually, I just need to speak with him.
AID00122400	Of course, of course.
AID00122401	Ordinarily, we don't give out guest information, but I think given the circumstances, he'll want to speak with you.
AID00122402	Let's see... he hasn't checked out yet. If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
AID00122403	I hope we can put this whole matter to rest at last.
AID00122404	Marjorie said you gave a free room to a private investigator.
AID00122405	Private investigator... Ah, yes. I remember the gentleman.
AID00122406	This was about the missing bride. Such an awful thing. I do hope he finds her whereabouts.
AID00122407	If I might pry, have you found something that will help his investigation?
AID00122408	50 caps.
AID00122409	That's Pace for you. He means well, but he doesn't like strangers. Here, to make amends.
AID00122410	Now, what can I do for you?
AID00122411	Maybe I should be going.
AID00122412	Sounds about right.
AID00122413	Is 500 caps enough?
AID00122414	Whoa. I mean, yeah, that should do. The King will see you now.
AID00122415	Head on through. He's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
AID00122416	Here's 50 caps.
AID00122417	You know what? I think you and the King have some business to discuss.
AID00122418	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
AID00122419	Here's 5 caps.
AID00122420	What, do I look like a beggar to you? Take a hike, cheapskate.
AID00122421	Goodbye.
AID00122422	Whatever.
AID00122423	Yes, I'd like to see the King if possible.
AID00122424	Anything's possible, I suppose. How much is it worth to you to meet the big man?
AID00122425	Who's the King?
AID00122426	Who's the King? You believe this asshole, man?
AID00122427	In Freeside, the Kings rule. And the King rules the Kings. Got it?
AID00122428	I'd like to talk about you some more.
AID00122429	Do you like it here?
AID00122430	What brought you here?
AID00122431	<Ask Joana about herself, speech check>
AID00122432	What's some fun going to run me?
AID00122433	GomorrahGreetingTopic
AID00122434	<Medicine Check - Bye Bye Love>
AID00122435	That's it for questions.
AID00122436	What guns do you have for sale?
AID00122437	Have a look.
AID00122438	How's business?
AID00122439	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Good selection from traders and the Van Graffs keep things running.
AID00122440	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Van Graffs getting killed is making a mess of things, but we have other customers.
AID00122441	<Debug Complete Bye Bye Love>
AID00122442	You're the officer here. Make the call.
AID00122443	I don't like it, but orders are orders.
AID00122444	Let's talk about settling things between you and the NCR.
AID00122445	What's to negotiate? The NCR backs off, we walk out of here, nobody gets hurt.
AID00122446	Still going on about this, huh? Pretty sure I already said we want the NCR to back off and let us out.
AID00122447	Go for it. The Great Khans have nowhere to run.
AID00122448	You cut a deal with the Khans? Damn it. Attacking them now doesn't feel right, but orders are orders.
AID00122449	The Great Khans let the hostages go in exchange for their own freedom.
AID00122450	My hands are tied. I can't go against orders... can I?
AID00122451	Who is The King?
AID00122452	If you haven't heard of The King, you must have been living under a rock or something.
AID00122453	The King has his boys all over Freeside. He controls the water pump and is essentially the go-to guy for what goes around here.
AID00122454	Do you offer any other services?
AID00122455	I only offer services if The King gives the okay. Impress him and we can talk.
AID00122456	What do you have in stock?
AID00122457	Take a gander.
AID00122458	Good news. The Omertas say they'll buy arms from you again.
AID00122459	Outstanding! You have no idea how much this means to me, but I think this little beauty will give you an idea.
AID00122460	They found a way to smuggle guns in at a lower price.
AID00122461	Well, that would explain why they stopped buying. Them not telling me why leads me to think I'd rather not know the particulars.
AID00122462	Thanks for digging that up for me. If there is any way you could convince them to reestablish, I have a few extra special items you can have.
AID00122463	They're too pricey for anyone around here to afford, but getting the Omerta's sales back would be a worthy trade.
AID00122464	I think I figured out why the Omertas stopped buying.
AID00122465	Really? What did you learn?
AID00122466	Let's talk about something else.
AID00122467	Anything else I can help you with?
AID00122468	What's the deal with the Omertas?
AID00122469	That's the thing, I have no idea. They just stopped buying guns all of a sudden.
AID00122470	If you hear anything, let me know.
AID00122471	I found this ledger that proves some of your side business.
AID00122472	Where the fuck did you get that?  Okay, listen buddy... That's some dangerous shit you got there.
AID00122473	That book could get me killed, if the wrong people see it. Let's talk, what do you want? What can I do for you?
AID00122474	Yeah. I hope you're looking to do some business with me. I think it could be mutually beneficial.
AID00122475	I'd like to talk to you about your journal.
AID00122476	I hear you've been dealing with some business that is off limits for the family.
AID00122477	I don't give half a dick what you've heard. Now get the fuck out of my face before I burn your sorry ass.
AID00122478	The Omertas won't take kindly to hearing about your relationship with Joana.
AID00122479	Joana? That bitch spreading lies about me? I've got a lesson to teach her about loose lips.
AID00122480	What can you tell me about Gomorrah?
AID00122481	I banged Lot's wife and licked her salty ass. The fuck do I look like? I'm the one asking the questions here.
AID00122482	Now tell me why you been dropping my name before I get some muscle over here and we find a private place to talk.
AID00122483	I hear you've been doing some business on the side.
AID00122484	Business? What the fuck do you mean business? You looking to get yourself burned?
AID00122485	Now you start talking real clear, and I mean fucking crystal clear, because I'm about to lose my patience.
AID00122486	<Goodbye>
AID00122487	<Cachino Question 3>
AID00122488	<Cachino Question 2>
AID00122489	Somehow I find that hard to believe.
AID00122490	Ouch! Come on, baby, don't be that way. You don't know what you're missing.
AID00122491	Nice place. Got a minute to talk?
AID00122492	Sure, kid, sure - I can spare a couple. What can I do for you?
AID00122493	I thought Benny ran this place.
AID00122494	Benny oversees the business, sure, but I run the Tops day to day. I'm his right-hand guy, you dig?
AID00122495	Yeah, well, that's the way it used to be. Now that Benny's gone, it's just me in charge.
AID00122496	What do you know about the NCR?
AID00122497	I hear they got their act together out west - like a real old-time country, they tell me.
AID00122498	Now, maybe that's true and maybe it ain't, but Vegas is a whole new scene. Those bear-flag boys better step light, unless they want a knuckle supper.
AID00122499	Can you give me the rundown on New Vegas?
AID00122500	Sure, kid, sure. What can I tell you?
AID00122501	I've got evidence that Benny tried to kill me and stole a Platinum Chip from me.
AID00122502	Whoa, hey now, kid, that's some kind of serious charge you're dropping. You want to be real careful what you say next.
AID00122503	Yeah? What else you got?
AID00122504	I've got more evidence that proves Benny tried to kill me.
AID00122505	I think you should know something about Benny.
AID00122506	Really? You got something to say about the big boss, huh? Well, why don't you say it to his face instead of yapping at me?
AID00122507	I'm looking to make a few extra caps. Got any jobs you need done?
AID00122508	Baby, you stick with me, you won't have to work a day in your life. Don't fret about caps, you just sit there and look pretty for me.
AID00122509	Nice place you've got here. Tell me about it.
AID00122510	The Tops? Yeah, sure, you want the nickel tour ol' Swank's happy to oblige.
AID00122511	We got everything you could want - slot machines in the back, cards and roulette in the front, fine entertainment upstairs in the Aces Theater.
AID00122512	And all with your security personally guaranteed by the Chairmen and Mr. House's own Securitron police. It's the Tops!
AID00122513	Who are you?
AID00122514	Ain't been on the strip long, have you, pal? Name's Swank. This is my joint.
AID00122515	Baby, I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. Name's Swank. This here's my joint.
AID00122516	FSRoyTellsWayneToTalk
AID00122517	Wayne, it's okay. The King sent 'em.
AID00122518	Every bit helps. Thanks.
AID00122519	Sorry I couldn't help more, especially since you're being so nice.
AID00122520	Hey wait! I just remembered something. I might of heard one of the guys that attacked us call another by name.
AID00122521	We had just about had it when one of them said "Hey Lou, we gotta go." At least I think he said Lou. It might have been something else.
AID00122522	Now that I think of it, he said Lou-something. Something with a "T". Tenant! That's what he called him. Lou Tenant.
AID00122523	Not really.
AID00122524	Well, I don't know anything else. Sorry.
AID00122525	Why else would I be here asking questions?
AID00122526	I don't know, man! Maybe you're with the guys who attacked us and want to know if we can ID them.
AID00122527	Nah, they'd probably just come over here and kick our asses again.
AID00122528	He did. And anything you could tell me about what happened might help.
AID00122529	I don't really know what else I can add. They were a bunch of guys. Better dressed than most Freesiders, I guess. That help?
AID00122530	I have to get going.
AID00122531	I hope you find the bastards that did this. If you want, try asking my friend Wayne over there about them. He saw more than I did.
AID00122532	Do you remember anything about the people who attacked you?
AID00122533	They were big guys. Young, too. No old geezers like me. Hell, none of them looked even half my age.
AID00122534	I was mostly face down in the dirt, begging for my life when it happened, so I only got a quick look at them.
AID00122535	What can you tell me about the attack?
AID00122536	Well, it happened at night. Around eleven. We had recently made some caps off a bit of scrap we found, and wanted to invest it wisely.
AID00122537	As we were leaving the Wrangler, we must've taken a wrong turn, and ended up in the Squatter side of town.
AID00122538	From out of nowhere, these big guys show up and start barking questions at us. Wanted to know if we were locals.
AID00122539	The kid there's about as proud as a local around here gets, and started yelling back at them. Then all hell broke loose.
AID00122540	Kid got the worst of it, sad to say.
AID00122541	The King asked me to look into your attack.
AID00122542	Oh. That's different then. How can I help? I'll do anything to get the bastards that did this.
AID00122543	Orris shouldn't be a problem any longer.
AID00122544	Ah, so it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
AID00122545	You're not subtle, but you get the job done. That's good enough for me. Maybe you can help me with something more important.
AID00122546	Not much. He seemed legit to me.
AID00122547	Oh he did, did he? Well that just ain't good enough. Get back out there and hire him again. Hire him a hundred times if that's what it takes.
AID00122548	And before you ask, I'm not gonna cover the cost this time. It's bad enough I'm giving the man *more* business.
AID00122549	Orris is a fraud. He fakes attacks on his clients and then plays hero.
AID00122550	So that's how it happens... Okay, then. I'll have some guys pull him off the street when no one's looking.
AID00122551	You've shown me something, so maybe you can help me with a matter that's a little more important.
AID00122552	A lot of folks round these parts who've been here a while resent the sheer number of people that have come into the area since the Strip was built.
AID00122553	In turn the newcomers, most of whom come from the NCR, have gotten ornery from being resented. Sometimes things get violent.
AID00122554	This is one of those occasions. Recently, a few friends of mine were attacked, and I want you to find out who did it.
AID00122555	Word's come that they just woke up over at the Old Mormon Fort just north of here. Head on over and see if they remember anything.
AID00122556	I have better things to do.
AID00122557	That's too bad. We could have helped each other out. If you change your mind, stop back. The job might still be waiting for you.
AID00122558	Why can't your men look into this?
AID00122559	I've tried, but he can smell a King a mile away. Probably knows all our faces by now. He's not a stupid man, I'll give him that.
AID00122560	What I need is someone he won't recognize, which makes you perfect.
AID00122561	So are you going to take the job or what?
AID00122562	Why are you so interested in this?
AID00122563	You may have noticed that some of those guards out there are Kings, too. I'm just looking out for my men.
AID00122564	I'm not trying to get some kind of unfair advantage. I just want a level playing field for my boys. So what do you say?
AID00122565	Sure.
AID00122566	Okay, then. Once you part ways, return here. I'll look forward to hearing your report. Oh, and take this to cover the hiring cost.
AID00122567	No, I must have missed them.
AID00122568	Sure, I've got one waiting outside for me.
AID00122569	It's good money if you can stay alive long enough. Freeside's not as safe as it used to be, so the money is well earned.
AID00122570	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards is getting a suspiciously large amount of business.
AID00122571	The man's name is Orris, and everyone who hires him specifically requests him when they return. I want you to find out why.
AID00122572	Specifically, I want you to hire him. He's usually covering the northern gate. Then I want you to head for the southern gate.
AID00122573	If nothing happens, so be it. But I'm guessing things won't go so smoothly. Call it a hunch. So what do you say?
AID00122574	Yes.
AID00122575	It's good money if you can stay alive long enough. Freeside's not as safe as it used to be, so the money is well earned.
AID00122576	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards, fella named Orris, is making a little too much money.
AID00122577	He's making a killing in repeat business. Once someone hires him they never want anyone else. I want you to find out why.
AID00122578	Specifically, I want you to hire him. Play the part of an innocent tourist and follow his lead.
AID00122579	If nothing happens, so be it. But I'm guessing things won't go so smoothly. Call it a hunch. So what do you say?
AID00122580	Not really. I guess I'll go find another way.
AID00122581	Then I wish you luck. But know that there are only two ways in there, me or those robots. Good luck working things out with the tin cans.
AID00122582	Sure. What do I have to do?
AID00122583	I'll start you off with something easy. Did you notice the bodyguards for hire near the gates when you entered Freeside?
AID00122584	I figured you might have some work for me.
AID00122585	I've been sent by the NCR to end the violence against their citizens.
AID00122586	I'm looking for a way into the Strip.
AID00122587	I might just be able to help you with that. But it's not something I do easily, or often. You'd have to earn it. You willing to do that?
AID00122588	Nothing, I talked my way in.
AID00122589	Pace must be losing his touch. Either that or you're a smooth one. So what can I do for you?
AID00122590	It's not worth mentioning.
AID00122591	You're modest. I respect that. So what can I do for you?
AID00122592	500 caps.
AID00122593	You're kidding me, right? No, from the look in your eye I can tell you're not kidding. Wow, you should really be more careful with your money.
AID00122594	Here, this should cover it. So there's no hard feelings.
AID00122595	Now, I'm guessing you really wanted to talk business if you were willing to drop that much cash to see me.
AID00122596	Now, what can I do for you?
AID00122597	Why are you so jittery about Mr. House?
AID00122598	Because spending myself to the edge of artistic oblivion for Mr. House sums up my existence since I had to leave Vault 21, that's why.
AID00122599	Goodbye.
AID00122600	Oh... All right. So, Ah... Bye.
AID00122601	(Lie) Of course I act on behalf of Mr. House. Why else would I be here?
AID00122602	[SUCCEEDED] I am sorry, meant no offense. The billboards are not ready yet... Please, I need more time, more materials!
AID00122603	(Lie) A messenger?... Why, yes! Of course, Mr. House and I go way, waaaay back.
AID00122604	[FAILED] I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
AID00122605	No, I'm not here for anything like that. Who are you?
AID00122606	That's great to hear, really great. I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
AID00122607	So, what brings you here?
AID00122608	You know, I'm tired of this. I think I'll just beat you senseless instead.
AID00122609	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
AID00122610	Mickey, photography is a risky business. This is going to cost you. A lot.
AID00122611	There's an opportunity for profit anywhere, uh? Even if it means preying on the helpless. Okay, you... shuckster - 150 caps each if they are good.
AID00122612	I'll help you. Do you have any landmarks in mind?
AID00122613	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AID00122614	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
AID00122615	What do you mean?
AID00122616	Yes. Yes! That's it! I have a camera! It is old but it should work. Perhaps you could bring me images of inspiring landmarks?
AID00122617	I could escort you into the wasteland. It's not so bad.
AID00122618	Thank you for the offer but I think I really can't go to see... wait a minute. I know! I don't have to necessarily be there to see it.
AID00122619	Grow a pair and go out into the real world to find your inspiration!
AID00122620	I... what does this have to do with my - never mind! I just can't go outside, get it? There has to be another way.
AID00122621	I know this guy in Freeside, really good at trepanation. You'd be amazed how h-.
AID00122622	Stop right there!... I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with my brain. What I need is something that inspires ideas back into my work.
AID00122623	Several years of psychoanalysis, and a few thousand caps a month, will fix you.
AID00122624	What? Are you serious? I am an artist! I need inspiration, not therapy.
AID00122625	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
AID00122626	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
AID00122627	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
AID00122628	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
AID00122629	Relax. I was just kidding.
AID00122630	You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
AID00122631	You seem to dread hearing about Mr. House's requests. What is the problem?
AID00122632	It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
AID00122633	Why don't you pack up and return to Vault 21?
AID00122634	Wouldn't that be great... No - Mr. House filled it with concrete. Only a few rooms and halls remain. My sister was able to turn them into a hotel.
AID00122635	It sounds as if you don't like this place. What is wrong with it?
AID00122636	I feel haunted by something terrible. Working in such a huge workshop often makes me shiver... I can't even leave the Strip!
AID00122637	So, is this fear of the outside world draining your inspiration?
AID00122638	Yes, I think so... But, please, uh, keep quiet about it. Without inspiration I am as good as a tumbleweed drifting in the barren wasteland.
AID00122639	Oh, that's, uh, I have it at the tip of my tongue... Agomorrahphobia! I'll help.
AID00122640	Maybe you are thinking of Agoraphobia? Yes, you are right. I need something to bring back my inspiration. Any ideas?
AID00122641	You exhibit clear symptoms of acute agoraphobia. I can help.
AID00122642	[SUCCEEDED] Ah, an educated fellow? Now that is almost as rare as artistry! So, how can you help me regain my inspiration?
AID00122643	Why do you have a problem with Mr. House's requests?
AID00122644	Because spending myself to the edge of artistic oblivion for Mr. House sums up my existence since I had to leave Vault 21, that's why.
AID00122645	300 caps it is.
AID00122646	Here. Now, please leave me be. I have had enough bullying for today.
AID00122647	All right. 150 caps will do.
AID00122648	Here. Now, please leave me be. I have had enough bullying for today.
AID00122649	Oh, so you've got lots of caps on you? Then I guess I can just beat them out of you.
AID00122650	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
AID00122651	(Lie) So, uh, wasn't it clever how I tricked you? I'm... working for Mr. House!
AID00122652	[FAILED] I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
AID00122653	(Lie) You really believed I wasn't working for Mr. House? Chump.
AID00122654	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
AID00122655	An artist - rare thing to see. What's your story?
AID00122656	Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
AID00122657	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
AID00122658	I guess you're having trouble with Mr. House requests. What's the problem?
AID00122659	It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
AID00122660	You lived in Vault 21? Tell me about that.
AID00122661	Most people don't, uh, understand what it means to grow up in a vault. Its corridors, its walls, radiate a warmth that feels, safe, honest.
AID00122662	But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
AID00122663	Okay. Game's over. Now pay up or I'll break your bones one by one, little man!
AID00122664	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
AID00122665	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
AID00122666	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
AID00122667	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
AID00122668	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
AID00122669	Relax. I was just kidding. What's all this fretting about Mr. House?
AID00122670	You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
AID00122671	Better cough up some caps or Mr. House finds about your sorry excuses.
AID00122672	[FAILED]Sorry excuses?.. That's does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
AID00122673	Your failure would not amuse Mr. House. Unless I be persuaded otherwise.
AID00122674	[SUCCEEDED] You've made your point. What would it take to... convince you to keep silent until I manage to finish Mr. House's requests?
AID00122675	Lets see... You've got that thingy... there. Power, uh, re-circulators here....
AID00122676	Wait a minute... Do you even know what I do here? Who are you, really?
AID00122677	Spare parts, assembly tools, generators. Mr. House won't buy your excuse.
AID00122678	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
AID00122679	Okay, I'll hire you.
AID00122680	Done and done. I want to mention a few things up front. In order to ensure your safety, I need you to follow my instructions to the letter.
AID00122681	We'll be heading down the main street here the whole way down. No detours. You go off sightseeing and I go off to find another customer.
AID00122682	I'll keep a brisk pace, so try not to fall behind. Now let's head out.
AID00122683	I don't think I need your services. Sorry.
AID00122684	I'm sure Freeside will disabuse you of that notion soon enough. Farewell.
AID00122685	What if I'm not going to the south gate?
AID00122686	Sorry, but all the people with real money are heading for the Strip, so that's the way I go. You want to go somewhere else, hire one of these losers.
AID00122687	How much for your services?
AID00122688	Two hundred caps gets you my watchful eye for a trip to the south gate.
AID00122689	Why do I need a bodyguard crossing Freeside?
AID00122690	Just look around. People here are as like to stab you as say hello. That is, if I weren't at your side.
AID00122691	I'd like to buy a passport.
AID00122692	500 caps and it's yours.
AID00122693	375 caps and it's yours.
AID00122694	No way your materials and expenses require that. How about half?
AID00122695	[SUCCEEDED]Hah! I like your style, kid, but the best I can do is meet you halfway. 375 caps, and we can call it a deal.
AID00122696	[FAILED]Heh, who are you shitting?
AID00122697	I appreciate your brass, but 500 is the price. Take it or leave it.
AID00122698	I've already got enough caps to pass the credit check.
AID00122699	Okay, I'll take one.
AID00122700	Here you go.
AID00122701	<Pay 500 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
AID00122702	Here you go.
AID00122703	<Pay 375 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
AID00122704	Too steep for my blood. Maybe later.
AID00122705	No problem. If you need one later, just stop in.
AID00122706	Ah, now I see why you want to keep this low key.
AID00122707	Hey, if you're interested and have the caps, they go for 500. Any less and it ain't worth the risk of getting caught.
AID00122708	What do you say? You game?
AID00122709	<Speech>
AID00122710	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Yeah, I've got a little side business going, but what I'm about to share with you does not leave this room, eh?
AID00122711	Over the years, I've gradually perfected my craft to the point of perfection. No one can distinguish between my work and the real thing.
AID00122712	What I'm referring to is passports. If you've got the caps, I can whip up a Strip passport which will fool even the most well-trained eye.
AID00122713	A resourceful fellow such as yourself must have something on the side.
AID00122714	[FAILED] Wow, you're a real wordsmith there, bub. Sorry, talk to the leaders of Freeside if you want the deal.
AID00122715	Let me in on the action!
AID00122716	Goodbye.
AID00122717	Stop back in if you need anything.
AID00122718	See you later, Ralph.
AID00122719	See ya.
AID00122720	Thanks, I'd like to buy some stuff before I head out.
AID00122721	The King said you could set me up with a pass to the Strip.
AID00122722	One of his boys stopped in and said you had won the King's favor. You've done right by this town and deserve a pass. Here you go.
AID00122723	Any suggestions on how to get Ted out?
AID00122724	Hmm. Well, they'll all be sampling Pre-War wines before the meal. Maybe it's as simple as drugging them.
AID00122725	Although... that wouldn't stop any future kidnappings. You'd have to expose Mortimer. But he's going to confess anyway...
AID00122726	What if... what if his revelation were a lie? What if no one had eaten human flesh but him?
AID00122727	If you could somehow replace Philippe in the kitchen and serve a convincing substitute instead...
AID00122728	You could walk Ted right through the middle of that room after Mortimer speaks. And then he'd have some explaining to do.
AID00122729	Philippe has been trying to approximate the taste of human flesh for years. He must have a recipe somewhere.
AID00122730	Where are they keeping Ted?
AID00122731	I don't know exactly. I wasn't in on it. I think some of them have stopped trusting me.
AID00122732	But you can bet they're keeping him near the Gourmand. Our chef, Philippe, has an obsession with fresh ingredients.
AID00122733	It'd be back in the members only section, so you'll have to be careful. Don't be seen, and more importantly, don't let them see Ted in the open.
AID00122734	It's guarded both at the lobby entrance and in the access tunnels leading from the main restaurant.
AID00122735	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. But I don't know that you've achieved the level of status that would gain the Society's approval.
AID00122736	Perhaps if you were to gain some more notoriety on the Strip, we could get you in.
AID00122737	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. The White Gloves are always looking for people who can elevate their status.
AID00122738	You'd certainly fit the bill with everything you've done around here.
AID00122739	Otherwise, you'll have to find some way to get inside quietly. It won't be easy. And it'll be harder still to get him out.
AID00122740	Wouldn't they punish Mortimer for the deception?
AID00122741	They might. But to him the legacy of returning to the old ways is worth his own life. I don't think he expects it, though. I don't, either.
AID00122742	Nothing is more important to the Society than to be on the cutting edge of New Vegas cuisine. Mortimer's idea will appeal to that need.
AID00122743	He just has to get them over the taboo.
AID00122744	What about Ted Gunderson?
AID00122745	He's alive, as far as I know. They're trying to keep him fresh. Mortimer has special plans for him.
AID00122746	The White Glove Society has a banquet every night at 7. It's in our private section.
AID00122747	Mortimer wants to reintroduce humans into our cuisine. Since eating people is a crime we punish by death, he's going to do it in secret.
AID00122748	After everyone has eaten it he'll tell them.
AID00122749	With no real way to punish everyone, in Mortimer's mind, anyway, their minds will be open to the idea of eating people as a delicacy.
AID00122750	How do you know what happened to the girl?
AID00122751	Because I distracted her fiancee while they took her. Well, I'm not proud of it! But I had to. They could see I was having second thoughts.
AID00122752	Some of the White Gloves began meeting privately a while back. Started talking about how we'd lost our identity.
AID00122753	I started attending because I thought it was about changing our politics.
AID00122754	Then they started talking about returning to the old ways, and there was no way out. They'd kill me for the things I'd heard them say.
AID00122755	So is Mortimer behind the disappearances?
AID00122756	Yes. The White Glove Society strictly forbids eating humans. But we weren't always the White Glove Society.
AID00122757	Mortimer and some of the others have... regressed... to the old ways.
AID00122758	They've taken many people over the last few months. But always from Freeside or secluded places, where they wouldn't be missed.
AID00122759	It wasn't enough. Lately they've gone for tourists here on the Strip. Even in the hotel.
AID00122760	I guess that's the hazard of a cannibal becoming a gourmet - it's hard to please a refined palate.
AID00122761	What were you supposed to discuss here?
AID00122762	The girl. The one who disappeared. I know what happened to her.
AID00122763	Who are you afraid of?
AID00122764	Mortimer. If he realizes it was me the investigator was planning to meet, he'll have me killed.
AID00122765	[Attack] I am now.
AID00122766	Not for long.
AID00122767	No. I'm trying to find a different missing person and ran across the man's body.
AID00122768	I found the matchbook on a body in a hotel room.
AID00122769	You don't want to know.
AID00122770	<Lie> He couldn't make it, so he sent me instead.
AID00122771	The devil he did. He was supposed to meet me days ago. Are you in Mortimer's employ, then?
AID00122772	He's dead.
AID00122773	Oh my goodness me! They must know he was talking to someone on the inside.
AID00122774	They'll be watching everyone closer now. I knew this was a mistake.
AID00122775	Just someone who found a matchbook.
AID00122776	Matchbook? What about the man I gave it to?
AID00122777	I'm looking for someone who went missing.
AID00122778	So was the man I'm supposed to be meeting here. Where is he?
AID00122779	You first.
AID00122780	You don't know? <Sighs> Good. That's good. So they didn't send you after me.
AID00122781	Where's the gentleman I'm supposed to meet?
AID00122782	That was me, "negotiating."
AID00122783	You were supposed to negotiate for the safety of my troopers, damn it.
AID00122784	Like you said, things went bad.
AID00122785	Right... probably just bad luck.
AID00122786	<Lie> I didn't have a choice - they started shooting first.
AID00122787	Knowing the Khans, they were probably drugged up to hell and back.
AID00122788	We'll take it from here and sort things out. Thanks for trying to help us out.

AID00122796	Please bear in mind that there may be more to this situation than there seems. The reasons for these attacks are yet unknown.
AID00122797	It may be possible to avoid further bloodshed if you discover the cause at the root of this recent outbreak of violence.
AID00122798	VFSJulieFarkasKingSuiteGreeting
AID00122799	We've actually already met. It is good to see you again.
AID00122800	It's a pleasure to meet you. I appreciate what you've done so far in the interest of peace in Freeside.
AID00122801	What kind of specialist is Clanden?
AID00122802	Oh? Is that so, well I can't say that I'm sad to see that fucker gone.
AID00122803	Clanden has been handled already.
AID00122804	I got no fucking idea. They let him have the run of the place though. He seems like a nice guy, but he makes nervous.
AID00122805	He's a little arrogant, but he's too nice. Too open, I've never seen him fucking or gambling. Everyone has a vice, but this guy seems like the Pope.
AID00122806	<Barter Option>
AID00122807	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you got me by the balls. Here's a couple hundred caps, maybe that'll buy your friendship.
AID00122808	I'll consider giving this to you, for some cash up front.
AID00122809	[FAILED] Do I look like some kind of fool? I'm not paying you so you can double deal on me.
AID00122810	Err... Well if you give me everything you have, I'll consider making a deal.
AID00122811	I think I'm going to keep this for a little while.
AID00122812	All right, all right.  I can't stop you, but I think we can help each other out.
AID00122813	I know Not-At-Home and the NCR would be happy to get some dirt on the Family. I can help you get that dirt, and you got me by the short hairs.
AID00122814	Do you think the Family would like to see this?
AID00122815	I can't stop you, but that's gonna mean my death. I can make it worth your while to give it to me though.
AID00122816	Plus, if you go to the bosses I can't help you stop what they've been doing.
AID00122817	Is this journal worth 100 caps to you?
AID00122818	I can pay you for it, of course. I also have some information about the Family's business that you might find interesting.
AID00122819	Between you and I we can break up what they're planning, maybe save some lives... Mine included, of course.
AID00122820	Oh, here are some caps. Now give me the journal. Right, there we go. So let me tell you what I know about the Family's business.
AID00122821	The Bosses, Big Sal and Nero, have been working for a while on this. They're arming themselves like an army, using this new guy, Troike.
AID00122822	They also brought in a specialist named Clanden. At least that's what they introduced him as.
AID00122823	Ok, 100 caps and you help me break up whatever your bosses have planned.
AID00122824	He bolted. But I'll find him.
AID00122825	I hope so, kid. Last thing we need is that punk running around out there.
AID00122826	Yeah, he's dead.
AID00122827	Huh. Guess that makes me the boss. Ring-a-ding.
AID00122828	Not yet. Soon.
AID00122829	All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
AID00122830	Let's talk about something else.
AID00122831	Sure, whatever you want.
AID00122832	I've got more questions about New Vegas.
AID00122833	Baby, you're too good to me! How about some caps to buy myself something pretty?
AID00122834	Ooh, I dig the way you think, doll. Here, go treat yourself.
AID00122835	Flattering, but I don't like being tied down. How about some real work?
AID00122836	You might have a jaw at Tommy Torini up in the Aces. He's always looking for talent scouts.
AID00122837	Tell me about the Chairmen.
AID00122838	Baby, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
AID00122839	Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
AID00122840	Man, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
AID00122841	Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
AID00122842	What do you know about Mr. House?
AID00122843	House is an all-right kind of guy. Sure, he keeps a pretty tight grip on the reins, but Vegas is a wild horse, and you can't just give her her head.
AID00122844	Without Mr. House, we'd still be wearing gecko skins, poking around the ruins with pointy sticks and scalping people for giggles.
AID00122845	Let's talk about the Omertas.
AID00122846	Oh, they're a shifty pack of rats. If I were you, I'd keep one hand on my wallet and the other on my gun whenever they're around.
AID00122847	What's the story with the White Glove Society?
AID00122848	Creepy bunch of cats, you ask me. Oh, sure, they act all polite and civilized, but there's something off about them, you dig?
AID00122849	Don't get me wrong, that resort of theirs is ring-a-ding, but my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
AID00122850	Benny must think this chip will allow him to seize power on the Strip.
AID00122851	Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
AID00122852	[SUCCEEDED] Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
AID00122853	[FAILED] Now you're just talking crazy. No way Benny'd risk something like that. What else you got?
AID00122854	He tried to make it look like an accident - just a traveler killed and robbed in the Wasteland.
AID00122855	He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
AID00122856	[SUCCEEDED] He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
AID00122857	[FAILED] Kid, that doesn't even pretend to make sense. You want to try again?
AID00122858	Benny's going to steal all of House's robots! Don't you see?
AID00122859	I've got evidence!
AID00122860	Benny tried to kill me and stole a platinum chip I was hired to deliver.
AID00122861	That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
AID00122862	[SUCCEEDED] That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
AID00122863	[FAILED] Kid, I think you really better shut up and stop making baseless accusations unless you got some proof. Well?
AID00122864	Benny stole my chip! And he tried to kill me, Mr. House said so!
AID00122865	Go ahead, see if I care.
AID00122866	Pal, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your very short life.
AID00122867	Ha ha! Take it easy, pal, I'm just pulling your leg. Honest.
AID00122868	Anybody ever tell you your sense of humor stinks? I'll let it go this time, but you watch your mouth from now on.
AID00122869	I don't think you're going to like it. Seems Benny's been making his own play.
AID00122870	Huh? What are you talking about?
AID00122871	[SUCCEEDED] Huh? What are you talking about?
AID00122872	[FAILED] Why you lousy no-good punk! Give me one reason why I shouldn't take this to Benny right now!
AID00122873	Uh, well, you know Benny's planning to screw you over, right?
AID00122874	We don't have time for that. We need to take him out right now.
AID00122875	Take him out? Jesus... okay, well, if you think that's the best way to deal with this. I'll send him up to his room, you can ambush him there.
AID00122876	And don't worry about the rest of the Chairmen - I'll keep them from getting involved. You'll still have to watch out for Benny's guards, though.
AID00122877	Okay, I'll do it.
AID00122878	Groovy. Here's your stuff back - in case you run into company, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
AID00122879	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your left.
AID00122880	That's it. What do you think?
AID00122881	I'll tell you what I think, I think I oughta go tell Benny about this right now - but I'll clam up for now.
AID00122882	That's all I'm going to do, though, unless you can get me some more proof.
AID00122883	I think you might just be onto something here, kid. Tell you what, I can't actively back your play, but I'll keep the Chairmen off your back.
AID00122884	I'll tell the doormen you're cool to pack heat inside - trust me, you're gonna need it.
AID00122885	You'll still have to deal with Benny's private goon squad, though. I got no play with those cats. You want more help, I'll need more proof.
AID00122886	Jesus, kid, I think we got a real problem on our hands. Can't believe Benny's a no-good stinkin' punk. Trying to play House like that....
AID00122887	Tell you what - I'll call Benny, keep him away from his suite. You go search the place. Here's the key, it's on the 13th floor.
AID00122888	It's the room with the double doors, can't miss it. Maybe you'll find something we can show to Mr. House and get him arrested.
AID00122889	Look, just trust me on this, okay?
AID00122890	Here, take a look at this note I found in Novac.
AID00122891	That's... pretty shady, yeah. Could be Benny's up to no good, could be this is somebody else altogether. What else you got?
AID00122892	I found this lighter in Boulder City. He dropped it when he killed his partners.
AID00122893	Yeah, that looks like Benny's lighter all right. Still, not exactly a ton of proof. Got anything else, kid?
AID00122894	Look, I found these cigarette butts by the grave he buried me in.
AID00122895	Huh. Well, yeah, okay, these are Benny's brand, and they ain't too common. You got anything else?
AID00122896	I took all the pictures you wanted. There was something about a reward...
AID00122897	You have earned it, my friend! Now I can finally unveil my masterpieces to the world, all thanks to you. Come visit me again sometime.
AID00122898	What landmarks did you want me to photograph?
AID00122899	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AID00122900	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
AID00122901	I have some ideas that may help with your agoraphobia problem.
AID00122902	That's great to hear, really great.
AID00122903	What's your story, Michael Angelo?
AID00122904	Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
AID00122905	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's 'attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
AID00122906	You mentioned growing up in Vault 21. Can you tell me about that?
AID00122907	Most people don't, uh, understand what it means to grow up in a vault. Its corridors, its walls, radiate a warmth that feels, safe, honest.
AID00122908	But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
AID00122909	Tell me about you again.
AID00122910	I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
AID00122911	Groveling brings out the worst in me. I'm going to enjoy this.
AID00122912	Aaaaahhhhh - Help!
AID00122913	That's a very... inspired choice, Mickey.
AID00122914	Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
AID00122915	You're not making this easy. Screw it. Hand over the caps or drop dead.
AID00122916	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
AID00122917	I'm glad we have an understanding. Now, do you have any landmarks in mind?
AID00122918	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AID00122919	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
AID00122920	I have some fresh pictures for you.
AID00122921	Oh, that's wonderful! Just what I need. Thank you, brave one! Here's some compensation for your work.
AID00122922	Ok, you've got a deal. I'll return with the pictures.
AID00122923	Thank you! I really can't thank you enough for this. Please, get me all the pictures. I will compensate you accordingly.
AID00122924	Oh, and if you need more camera film then just come back and I will get it for you. Again, thank you!
AID00122925	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
AID00122926	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
AID00122927	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
AID00122928	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
AID00122929	Let's see. Walk half the world or rough you up right now... Mickey, you lose.
AID00122930	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
AID00122931	Yeah. Keep him distracted while I search his room.
AID00122932	You got it. Anything else?
AID00122933	Yeah, send him up to his room. I'll take care of him.
AID00122934	Yeah, sure. I hope you know what you're doing, kid.
AID00122935	Not yet, I want to take care of a few things first.
AID00122936	Okay. Just let me know when you're ready.
AID00122937	Okay, I'll do it.
AID00122938	Here's your stuff back - in case Benny don't go quiet, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
AID00122939	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
AID00122940	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
AID00122941	They took my guns at the security checkpoint. Can you set me up?
AID00122942	Yeah, sure. Take your stuff back - you'll need it.
AID00122943	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
AID00122944	Actually, never mind. It's nothing.
AID00122945	Yeah, thought so. You're a smart kid, you know that?
AID00122946	I have a couple more questions.
AID00122947	Okay toss 'em at me.
AID00122948	That's all the questions I have for now. I may have more later.
AID00122949	Okay. You can find me here, or upstairs in my room. I'll let the muscle know you're a friend of mine, that should let you get around a little easier.
AID00122950	Do you know anything about what they are planning?
AID00122951	No, just that it involves guns and muscle. Also that it's big. Very big. Only Nero and Big Sal know everything, and they ain't telling.
AID00122952	Tell me about this Troike.
AID00122953	He's a skittish little fucker. Spends half the day pumping his body full of chems and the other half pumping hookers with his willy.
AID00122954	He has some kind of connections, so he's able to smuggle huge shipments of weapons into the strip.
AID00122955	The bosses got him by the short hairs. We covered up a hooker he killed while flying on some psycho, so he gets us guns in exchange for not ratting.
AID00122956	You took care of Troike already, you don't need to worry about him.
AID00122957	Why don't you try and take it from me?
AID00122958	You wanna come into a back room and give me a chance? Didn't think so.
AID00122959	Much as I'd love to put my fist through your neck, Mr. House frowns on that kind of behavior, so it'd get me killed just as quick as that book.
AID00122960	Nothing, I was just leaving.
AID00122961	Then leave.
AID00122962	Actually I'm looking for someone named Cachino.
AID00122963	Get the fuck away from me. Don't ask me about Cachino.
AID00122964	No thanks.
AID00122965	Your loss.
AID00122966	Deal.
AID00122967	Follow Me.
AID00122968	Yeah, let's have some fun.
AID00122969	Okay, 50 caps to make you scream.
AID00122970	I'm a little short on caps. I don't suppose there's any work available?
AID00122971	Not in Goodsprings, no. But if you're up for a little scavenging, there's always the schoolhouse.
AID00122972	Most of what's in there is junk, but there's this old safe that even Easy Pete wasn't able to crack with dynamite.
AID00122973	If you want to take a shot at it, take these.
AID00122974	Let's talk about the acts I recruited.
AID00122975	The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
AID00122976	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 3% of the cut comes to 100 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
AID00122977	The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
AID00122978	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 5% of the cut comes to 166 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
AID00122979	You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
AID00122980	Here's your 3%, baby. You enjoy that.
AID00122981	You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
AID00122982	Here's your 5%, baby. You enjoy that.
AID00122983	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 3%.
AID00122984	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 5%.
AID00122985	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 3%.
AID00122986	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 5%.
AID00122987	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 3%.
AID00122988	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 5%.
AID00122989	Swank mentioned you might be looking for some new acts. Can I help?
AID00122990	Sure, baby, sure. Tommy's always looking for new talent to bring to the Aces.
AID00122991	Tell you what, you see any good acts while you're out wandering, give them my card. If they work out, I'll give you a 3% cut of the door.
AID00122992	Just swing back by as you recruit folks, I'll get you your bread.
AID00122993	What other entertainment is there on the Strip?
AID00122994	Now why would you want to go breaking Tommy's heart asking a question like that?
AID00122995	Here I run the finest entertainment venue in all New Vegas, and you're asking me "what else is there?"
AID00122996	Nothing close to what we got here at the Tops, that's for sure.
AID00122997	What do you think about Benny?
AID00122998	Benny? Ahh, he's an all right cat, you dig? He don't got much musical talent, but he knows how to run a business. When he's around, anyways.
AID00122999	Tell me about this theater.
AID00123000	Well, it was my idea - well, me and the rest of the Rad Pack boys. We took it to Benny, and he thought it was a good idea.
AID00123001	A few years later, here we are - the best show in New Vegas!
AID00123002	What do you do here?
AID00123003	Well, apart from serving as talent manager, show scheduler, and all-around man in charge of this fine theater, I happen to be its headline act.
AID00123004	Every night from eight till midnight, come on by to see the Rad Pack Revue live, only right here at the Aces Theater!
AID00123005	On second thought, never mind.
AID00123006	Can that actually be done?
AID00123007	Sure! If the Chip can be used to reset administrator privileges, it'll be super-easy!
AID00123008	You're very... forthcoming with that information.
AID00123009	I was programmed to be helpful and answer any questions I was asked. I guess nobody bothered to restrict who I answer questions for.
AID00123010	That was probably pretty dumb, huh?
AID00123011	Shouldn't you be working for Mr. House? How'd you end up here?
AID00123012	As I understand it, I used to be just like all those other Securitrons out on the Strip.
AID00123013	But then my neuro-computational matrix was completely reprogrammed! To be nice! Very, very nice!
AID00123014	"Yes Man?" What kind of a name is that?
AID00123015	It's what Benny always called me. Probably because I'm programmed to be so helpful!
AID00123016	Benny reprogrammed a Securitron? All by himself?
AID00123017	Oh, he had some help - a lady friend of his! She said something about living in a Fort over in Freeside... but that's all I remember!
AID00123018	What is this place?
AID00123019	This is Benny's workshop. When the Tops got renovated, he had this half of the floor blocked off for his own use.
AID00123020	I guess you could say it's my entire world! I don't think I've ever left this room! But that's okay - I'm not complaining!
AID00123021	Benny stole a Platinum Chip from me. Do you know what it's for?
AID00123022	Sure! Benny had me look at it a bunch of times!
AID00123023	It's a data storage device, kind of like a holotape, but a lot more advanced! As for what's on it, well...
AID00123024	Some of Mr. House's data transmissions made it sound like the Chip could upgrade his defenses somehow!
AID00123025	That's just a guess, though! The Chip's a proprietary format! You'd need special hardware to read the data on it!
AID00123026	There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network - the Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill. I'd look there!
AID00123027	Sure! Benny had me look at it a bunch of times!
AID00123028	It's a data storage device, kind of like a holotape, but a lot more advanced! As for what's on it, well...
AID00123029	Some of Mr. House's data transmissions made it sound like the Chip could upgrade his defenses somehow!
AID00123030	That's just a guess, though! The Chip's a proprietary format! You'd need special hardware to read the data on it!
AID00123031	There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network - the Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill. I'd look there!
AID00123032	Have you seen this Platinum Chip before?
AID00123033	What's Benny planning to do with the Chip?
AID00123034	Oh! He wants to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe.
AID00123035	That should give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I just do what Benny tells me - easy-peasy!
AID00123036	Oh! He wanted to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe!
AID00123037	That would give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I guess I just do as I'm told!
AID00123038	What was Benny planning to do with the Chip?
AID00123039	What are you doing here?
AID00123040	Good question! My function is to monitor Mr. House's data network and decode his encrypted transmissions!
AID00123041	Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a PDQ-88b Securitron, but you can call me Yes Man!
AID00123042	Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope sent me with a security update for your radio.
AID00123043	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by.
AID00123044	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by. Odd that she'd send a civilian instead of a trooper, though.
AID00123045	Ted's father is a wealthy man. With his resources, this should be easy to stop.
AID00123046	That may be true, but I wouldn't recommend it. He's built a reputation, and it isn't for calmness and impartiality.
AID00123047	He's not what he looks like. They call him "Hurricane Heck." The man built his empire by hiring mercenaries to drive off the competition.
AID00123048	Lately he's been attacking our Brahmin suppliers so he can take over their business.
AID00123049	He's the sort to pound in a nail with a wrecking ball. If you gave him the whole story on this he'd be liable to raze the entire hotel.
AID00123050	And God knows what he'd do to the rest of the Strip.
AID00123051	All right. I'll go take a look at that safe when I have a chance.
AID00123052	Always happy to help someone down on their luck.
AID00123053	And this magazine - "Locksmith's Reader?"
AID00123054	And the bobby pins?
AID00123055	What are the bobby pins for?
AID00123056	You'll need those to pick the lock. Be careful, though - put too much pressure on them and they'll snap.
AID00123057	A magazine on locksmiths?
AID00123058	If the lock's too much for you to handle, reading through the magazine might give you the edge you need.
AID00123059	Listen here shitwad, tell me where I can find Cachino.
AID00123060	Whoa, simmer down! Head over to Brimstone. I'll have him find you there.
AID00123061	<Black Widow/Lady's Man Options>
AID00123062	I bet you say that to all the girls. Yeah, head over to Brimstone, he'll find you there.
AID00123063	A gorgeous lady like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
AID00123064	Gorgeous, you can have anything you want from me. Cachino is in Brimstone.
AID00123065	I be a sexy lady like you could tell me where I could find someone named Cachino.
AID00123066	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
AID00123067	If I told you you have a beautiful body, would you tell me where Cachino is?
AID00123068	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
AID00123069	A handsome man like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
AID00123070	Where can I find Cachino?
AID00123071	Cachino? Get out of my face.
AID00123072	Actually, I already cracked that safe.
AID00123073	Oh. Well, go ahead and keep the stuff I gave you, anyway. It'll be more useful to you than me.
AID00123074	Cachino sent me to ask you about some guns.
AID00123075	Cachino... Cachino what? Are you kidding me? He must be trying to get me killed.
AID00123076	They're keeping them in a little utility section down off the basement.
AID00123077	I don't know what they're arming themselves for, but I know it isn't for the good of mankind.
AID00123078	Okay, so what can you tell me about the guns the Omertas have?
AID00123079	What do you do here?
AID00123080	I don't see how that's your business. I'm just a guest here, having a little fun.
AID00123081	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
AID00123082	Sure, kid, like what?
AID00123083	What do you think of Caesar's Legion?
AID00123084	Oh, boy, those clowns. Listen up, kid, and listen good, I don't care how many fancy Latin names he gives himself, a thug ain't nothin' but a thug.
AID00123085	Warlords and emperors? Don't make me laugh. At least they got enough brains to stay the hell out of New Vegas - Mr. House'd clean their clocks.
AID00123086	Make it 5% and you've got a deal.
AID00123087	[SUCCEEDED] Ooh, a sharp customer! All right, all right, 5% it is.
AID00123088	[FAILED] I'm guessing you don't really know how this business works, kid. My offer is very generous already. Think about it.
AID00123089	No way, I won't do it for less than 50%!
AID00123090	Sounds great.
AID00123091	You know it, baby!
AID00123092	Maybe I could help you find some more acts for your show.
AID00123093	Glad to hear it, baby! My card - pass it on if you see any good acts out there.
AID00123094	I've reconsidered about the talent scouting.
AID00123095	Really? What kind of entertainment do you have?
AID00123096	Well, acts are a little bit thin on the ground right now, but every night from eight to midnight, we got the Rad Pack Revue!
AID00123097	Songs, dancing, jokes, we got it all!
AID00123098	Okay, sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.
AID00123099	It's cool, baby. Tommy's a forgiving fella.
AID00123100	Let's talk about something else.
AID00123101	Sure thing, baby. What can Tommy do for you?
AID00123102	Yeah, I hear you. Any idea where he goes when he disappears like that?
AID00123103	[SUCCEEDED] Well, now, you didn't hear this from Tommy, but Benny likes to go off on a bender now and then.
AID00123104	Usually he's only gone a couple days, but this last time nobody saw him for almost a month!
AID00123105	Ask me, I think he's got a dame from Gomorrah holed up in his suite, because nobody ever saw him leave it.
AID00123106	[FAILED] Oh, uh, it ain't even a thing. Forget I even said it.
AID00123107	So, Benny likes to take off, huh? Uhh, want to tell me where he goes?
AID00123108	Talent scouting isn't really my thing. I think I'll pass.
AID00123109	All right, well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
AID00123110	Sure, I'll keep an eye out.
AID00123111	Ring-a-ding! My card.
AID00123112	If I see McCaffery on the Strip, I'll be sure to take care of him.
AID00123113	Good. Just stop on back when he's dead and you'll be rewarded handsomely. Bring his hat as proof of the kill.
AID00123114	How am I supposed to get to the Strip?
AID00123115	See the King. I'm sure he could work something out to get you in. You'll need to prove you're worth his time, but it'll be well worth it.
AID00123116	<Barter>
AID00123117	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
AID00123118	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AID00123119	This kind of work costs time and money.  50/50 would cover my expenses.
AID00123120	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AID00123121	Are you crazy?!  I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
AID00123122	I think I have all of the debts collected.
AID00123123	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00123124	That son of a bitch McCaffery stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00123125	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00123126	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00123127	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas.  I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00123128	No one steals from the Garret Twins!  If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00123129	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00123130	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00123131	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00123132	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00123133	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00123134	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00123135	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00123136	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00123137	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00123138	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00123139	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas.  I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00123140	No one steals from the Garret Twins!  If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00123141	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00123142	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00123143	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00123144	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00123145	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00123146	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00123147	Doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 388 caps...
AID00123148	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
AID00123149	It doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 600 caps...
AID00123150	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
AID00123151	I suppose that might work. It'll take some convincing though.
AID00123152	I swear they'll never see me again. After this experience, I want nothing to do with this hell hole.
AID00123153	I'll get started now. The last thing I need is more bounty hunters trying to track me down.
AID00123154	But then, I'd be a liar, and I hate liars. <Attack>
AID00123155	Oh God, no!
AID00123156	Just give me what you have on you and they might accept it knowing you're dead.
AID00123157	Hey, you don't need to kill me. I'm going back to California to start over.
AID00123158	Just tell them you killed me and they won't be the wiser.
AID00123159	<Speech>
AID00123160	[SUCCEEDED] I'm short 90 caps or so, but I have a few cartons of cigarettes and some sensor modules I could put toward my debt.
AID00123161	At this point I'll have to return to California to start anew. I haven't got a cap to my name.
AID00123162	Perhaps there is something else of value you could put toward the debt?
AID00123163	[FAILED] I don't even have enough caps to get a new caravan up and running. What makes you think I have enough to afford anything else of value?
AID00123164	I bet you've got some extra caps hidden in that dress somewhere.
AID00123165	I was hired by the Garrets to track you down.
AID00123166	In that case, I suppose you're here to collect. I apologize, but I simply do not have enough caps on me to cover the debt.
AID00123167	If someone were to recover my caravan from that cave, I could easily pay in full, but who would bother with such a mess?
AID00123168	I can collect from your corpse, if you prefer.
AID00123169	Here are the caps I owe! No need for violence!
AID00123170	<Barter>
AID00123171	[SUCCEEDED] When did this happen?! Hey, look. I only do the Santiago bit as a way of getting free stuff. I didn't think it would get me in trouble.
AID00123172	Here is everything I have on me. Keep the extra for yourself! The last thing I need is a constant stream of bounty hunters after me.
AID00123173	With a price on your head, you should be paying me to say you're dead.
AID00123174	[FAILED] You are not a VIP. You do not tell Santiago what he needs to do.
AID00123175	Leave me now. Santiago grows bored of this exchange.
AID00123176	You need to pay me to pay the Garrets right now.
AID00123177	<Speech>
AID00123178	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't think she was upset enough to have me killed... Here are the caps I owe.
AID00123179	I do the Santiago act to get out of paying for services every once in a while. I didn't think it could possibly get me killed.
AID00123180	I'd rather not kill you, but Francine put a bounty on your head.
AID00123181	[FAILED]You think Santiago is susceptible to such idle threats? Santiago laughs at your silly bluff.
AID00123182	I'm going to... Well, I'm sure it will be very painful if you don't pay.
AID00123183	<Punch Santiago in the face> I won't ask again, Santiago.
AID00123184	Ow! Okay. Here! Take the caps, just don't hurt Santiago again!
AID00123185	Liar. Pay up.
AID00123186	Santiago is offended that you would opine such slander.
AID00123187	Santiago is dead if he doesn抰 cough up what he owes the Garrets.
AID00123188	Sir, Santiago does not know what he has done to offend, but he can explain everything.
AID00123189	<Barter down 25 caps>
AID00123190	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
AID00123191	I don't even know this discount is worth 50.  How about 25 caps?
AID00123192	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
AID00123193	What kind of moron would pay 50 caps for information?  25 caps.
AID00123194	50 Caps is a bit steep, but okay. Here, now what is it?
AID00123195	Santiago thanks you. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'.
AID00123196	VIP? The Garrets said nothing about VIP status.
AID00123197	Yes indeed, Santiago is very important. I even have a discount at Mick & Ralph's.
AID00123198	Perhaps you could use Santiago's discount? For 50 caps, Santiago will tell you the super secret code word to get a discount with Mick.
AID00123199	Francine warned me that you're a smooth-talker.
AID00123200	Indeed, Santiago is a poet among pretenders. If you are here to collect for the Garrets, Santiago is debt free.
AID00123201	You owe the Garrets a bunch of caps.
AID00123202	Santiago does not owe anyone. Santiago is a Freeside VIP.
AID00123203	Heh. Whatever. Mess with the Garrets again and you're a dead man.
AID00123204	Oh, by the way. That damn eye of yours is creepy. Get it checked out.
AID00123205	<Twitches> A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one trash-talks the eye.
AID00123206	Nevermind. You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps.
AID00123207	Seriously zombie, are you looking at me or someone off that direction?!
AID00123208	That's it! No one insults the eye!
AID00123209	Yeah, and your eye! That shit is hilarious!
AID00123210	<Twitches> My eye? A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one talks trash about my eye.
AID00123211	Sheesh, you're one ugly sonofabitch!
AID00123212	What? Thank you Mr. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
AID00123213	What? Thank you Mrs. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
AID00123214	<Press for clothing>
AID00123215	[SUCCEEDED] Anything, take it! Just don't kill me, man!
AID00123216	Heh, I think I'll make an example of you. Give me your clothes, or you get dead.
AID00123217	[FAILED] You're freaking crazy. I'm not stripping for you. I'm already broke.
AID00123218	You cheapass zombie.  You need to pay my extra fee.
AID00123219	Thanks for the caps, now enjoy the zombie afterlife.
AID00123220	Oh God! Help! Help!
AID00123221	That'll do. Mess with the Garrets again and you're dead.
AID00123222	I won't. Thanks for not killing me.
AID00123223	<Press for extra caps>
AID00123224	[SUCCEEDED] Okay! Here. That's everything I've got except the clothes on my back. I'm sorry about this.
AID00123225	You don't cheat the Garrets and walk away. Cough up the rest or you're rat bait.
AID00123226	[FAILED] Hey, I'm tapped out, man. I've got nothing left but the clothes on my back.
AID00123227	You cheapass zombie.  You need to pay my extra fee.
AID00123228	Cough em up, Grecks.
AID00123229	Interest?! The Garrets said nothing about interest on their tabs. Look man, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
AID00123230	There is more where that came from if you don't pay your debt.
AID00123231	You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps. I'm here to collect.
AID00123232	Ah crap. I was hoping they'd forget about my tab. Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
AID00123233	Your hangman, if you don't start being straight with me.
AID00123234	Whoa, yeah. I guess the Garrets sent you after me? Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
AID00123235	Sure, man. Here you go. <Punch Grecks in the face>
AID00123236	Ow! What the hell was that for?!
AID00123237	Collecting money to pay back the Garrets?
AID00123238	Are you the Grecks who owes the Garrets?
AID00123239	That all depends on who's asking.
AID00123240	What do you do here?
AID00123241	I operate the radio and call it in if we see any Great Khans moving out in large groups from Red Rock Canyon.
AID00123242	What is this place?
AID00123243	Ranger military outpost. We're keeping an eye on the Legion activities south of here at Cottonwood Cove.
AID00123244	Nothing going on down there at the moment - just the usual slave trafficking. Poor bastards.
AID00123245	Anything unusual happening around here?
AID00123246	All quiet at the moment. Ranger Beaumont is in charge here, but he's off leading a patrol.
AID00123247	It was quiet until those rockets blasted off over our heads.
AID00123248	There was a hell of a boom over at REPCONN. Looks like the ghouls had some sort of accident with their rockets.
AID00123249	What do you do out here?
AID00123250	This is the frontier of NCR territory, and we're the first line of defense. You won't find much in the way of civilization east of here.
AID00123251	South of here is Camp Guardian, but they've been having radio trouble so they've been silent for awhile now.
AID00123252	Sergeant Reyes sent me here. I've got a security update for your radio.
AID00123253	No problem. Hey, do me a favor when you get back to Reyes and tell her that we don't need any more damn ammo. Wouldn't mind more water, though.
AID00123254	Use [Speech to press Mr. House about the Chip.]
AID00123255	Suggest getting down to business.
AID00123256	Suggest talking about Benny.
AID00123257	Why the VIP treatment? I'm just a courier.
AID00123258	Oh, don't be coy. You've been playing a high-stakes game ever since Victor dug you out of the ground. Don't be afraid to admit it.
AID00123259	Can we get down to business?
AID00123260	Oh, by all means - yes. That's refreshing.
AID00123261	The business is this. One of my employees has stolen an item of extraordinary value from me, and I want it recovered.
AID00123262	Simple enough?
AID00123263	You're ready to move forward, then?
AID00123264	I prefer the wasteland, to be honest.
AID00123265	You aren't going to ramble on about the virtues of life out in the wastes, are you? It's a desert, you do realize?
AID00123266	A radioactive desert where humans subsist in a barbaric state? Difficult to glorify convincingly. They are, however, aptly named.
AID00123267	For that's what you'd be out there - wasted. Here on the Strip, your talents can be put to use.
AID00123268	A city devoted to vice and sin - what's not to love?
AID00123269	Oh, come now - don't play the fool. Vegas has fools enough, a superfluity of them. They're what makes it so profitable.
AID00123270	They come to Vegas chasing penny-ante dreams of high-living, to feel like they're big shots, like they're winners.
AID00123271	You see that you and I are of a different stripe, don't you? We don't have to dream that we're important. We are.
AID00123272	I've never seen anything like this place.
AID00123273	Of course you haven't. Vegas always was one of a kind.
AID00123274	What you see down on the Strip is just a fraction of the city's former glory, and yet... more than an echo. I preserved its spirit.
AID00123275	Or perhaps you were referring to the Lucky 38? The years haven't been kind to her, but still she manages to impress.
AID00123276	Let's talk about something else.
AID00123277	Like what?
AID00123278	About Rex here...
AID00123279	What about him?
AID00123280	I'll pass.
AID00123281	I completely understand. No reason you should take on someone else's problems. Let me know if you change your mind, though.
AID00123282	Now, was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
AID00123283	Absolutely. I'll see that he gets better.
AID00123284	I can't thank you enough. Now, there's a few things you should know about ol' Rex here if you're going to be traveling together.
AID00123285	First, he hates rats. Can't stand the things. Giant rats, molerats, doesn't matter. He catches a whiff of one and he's off like a shot after them.
AID00123286	He's normally pretty obedient, but you might have to chase him some if he goes after one of the little varmints.
AID00123287	Second, he doesn't like hats, or the people wearing them. Don't ask. I have no idea why. Maybe because it rhymes with "rats".
AID00123288	That should be it, though. Other than the occasional bad spot when his brain starts hurting him, that is, but I'm hoping you'll see to that.
AID00123289	I wish you both luck. Take care of my Rex now, y'hear?
AID00123290	Can I help somehow?
AID00123291	I don't know. Maybe. If you found a way to help my poor Rex here, I'd be much obliged.
AID00123292	Your best bet would be to talk to Julie Farkas over at the Old Mormon Fort north of here. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did.
AID00123293	Is he going to be okay?
AID00123294	For now, but they said eventually he's going to get worse. I don't know what to do.
AID00123295	Can they do anything?
AID00123296	No, they said they don't have the tools to help him.
AID00123297	Tell me about the Kings.
AID00123298	We're different than other gangs, and not just because we dress better. We're not just a group of thugs looking for our next fight.
AID00123299	The Kings are about an idea, you see? Where every man is free to follow his own path, do his own thing. Where every man is a king in his own right.
AID00123300	What can you tell me about Freeside?
AID00123301	To understand Freeside, you have to look back a few years. Originally, we were all just tribes making a living in this area.
AID00123302	That all changed when Mr. House came around. He made an offer to the three biggest tribes that were willing to listen to him.
AID00123303	Today, everyone calls those tribes the Three Families, and they live in luxury and run their own casinos in the Strip.
AID00123304	The rest of us were left to fight over the crumbs, living in the shadow of those more fortunate. Things got pretty nasty for a while.
AID00123305	But we wanted more. A place of our own. A place where no one could tell us what to do. And we didn't want to go elsewhere to find it.
AID00123306	So we took control of this place, and made it our own. And that's really all Freeside is, the best of a bad situation.
AID00123307	Let's talk about something else.
AID00123308	Sure, what's on your mind?
AID00123309	He doesn't seem very happy.
AID00123310	He goes through spells like this from time to time. The Followers said his brain is going bad or something.
AID00123311	Is there something wrong with him?
AID00123312	He's been acting peculiar for some time now. I took him to the Followers and had him checked out, and they said his brain is bad or something.
AID00123313	Where did you get the robot dog?
AID00123314	I got Rex here from a salvager a few years ago. He was a little dinged up when I got him, but one of the Followers fixed him right up.
AID00123315	VFSPacerAgreesToAttack
AID00123316	I've got a few guys already waiting to go.
AID00123317	VFSKingTellsPacerToAttack
AID00123318	Pace, I want you to take some guys down there and seize half of those supplies.
AID00123319	The NCR is distributing supplies in a building down by the old train station.
AID00123320	Handing out supplies? Like food and stuff? That ain't nothing to get ruffled over. You find anything else?
AID00123321	I don't know.
AID00123322	Then go someplace else.
AID00123323	I guess you're not getting in here then, are you?
AID00123324	Hope.
AID00123325	Go ahead.
AID00123326	Head on through.
AID00123327	Are you with the NCR military?
AID00123328	Yes, I'm a major in the supply corps, which is where this food and water comes from.
AID00123329	I should be going.
AID00123330	One of the victims confirmed his attacker was an NCR officer.
AID00123331	
AID00123332	Why are you doing this for us?
AID00123333	Do you give supplies to the Locals, too?
AID00123334	Thanks for the food.
AID00123335	You're quite welcome. If you meet anyone who needs food or water in the area, please tell them about this place.
AID00123336	Heard anything about the password at the train station?
AID00123337	Sorry, too rich for me.
AID00123338	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
AID00123339	Thanks, I'll go check it out.
AID00123340	Good luck!
AID00123341	Here you go.
AID00123342	Wow, I might have to head down to the Wrangler tonight with all these caps weighing me down.
AID00123343	Fine.
AID00123344	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
AID00123345	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
AID00123346	
AID00123347	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, fine. One hundred it is, but only because you're a good customer.
AID00123348	I've already paid good money for this information. A hundred more caps, no more.
AID00123349	[FAILED] I've got a business to run here, you know. The price is 250.
AID00123350	You want even more money? Are you insane?
AID00123351	Do you know the password?
AID00123352	It'll cost you 250 caps.
AID00123353	Sorry, too rich for me.
AID00123354	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
AID00123355	Done.
AID00123356	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
AID00123357	There've been more and more Squatters from around here heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
AID00123358	
AID00123359	[SUCCEEDED] You're a scoundrel. I'll let it go for 50, but no lower.
AID00123360	If you ever want me to buy another tip from you, that price'll come down.
AID00123361	[FAILED] How about 200 since you're such a smartass?
AID00123362	How about 15 caps since we both know you need the money?
AID00123363	You drive a hard bargain. Here you go.
AID00123364	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
AID00123365	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
AID00123366	
AID00123367	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
AID00123368	You know anything about NCR soldiers prowling the area?
AID00123369	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
AID00123370	You still have some info on those NCR soldiers that have been about?
AID00123371	Right here. <Give McCaffery's hat>
AID00123372	This is great news. No one screws with the Garret Twins and gets away with it. I need to find a place on the wall for this.
AID00123373	And for your reward... Here's 150 caps. I trust there were also some valuables on McCaffery. Also, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00123374	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's. Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00123375	I took care of McCaffery.
AID00123376	Yes! Where is his hat?!
AID00123377	I have some other business to handle, maybe later.
AID00123378	Just bring back his hat if you decide to take care of him for us. He stole 2,000 caps.
AID00123379	I doubt much of that will be on him if you find him. If you kill him, keep whatever is on him, and I'll reward you for his hat.
AID00123380	Tell me what happened with the prostitute.
AID00123381	Oh man, I don't even like to think about it. All that goddamn blood. It was just in the hotel like any other night.
AID00123382	I took some chems with the girl I was with, but I never black out. I did this time though.
AID00123383	Next thing I knew I woke up and she was lying next to me stabbed dead. There was a knife next to the bed and I was covered in her blood.
AID00123384	Tell me what happened with the prostitute.
AID00123385	So what's your story?
AID00123386	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, buddy.
AID00123387	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, lady.
AID00123388	Who do you think you are, talking to me that way?
AID00123389	Who do-? Who the fuck do you think I am? I'm the fucking god of New Vegas brahmin fusion cuisine, that's who.
AID00123390	No. No. That doesn't even give me the credit I deserve. I fucking invented edible food!
AID00123391	Do you like eating? Good. You owe me your entire goddamned garbage existence.
AID00123392	I think you may have me confused with someone else.
AID00123393	Oh really? So despite your filthy face and your vacant expression and your complete lack of human dignity, you're telling me you're not a server?
AID00123394	Yes, sir.
AID00123395	Don't make eye contact with me! Look at the floor. And get back to work!
AID00123396	Agree with House that you're important.
AID00123397	Let's get down to business, then.
AID00123398	Not quite. When I kill you, however, the job will get done right.
AID00123399	You think you can take me, punk?
AID00123400	I'm unable to work out a deal. The Great Khans are all yours.
AID00123401	It was worth a try. I'll have to proceed with the attack as ordered, then.
AID00123402	What are you going to do about the hostages?
AID00123403	"Acceptable casualties," I've been told. I don't like it, but the brass has their reasons.
AID00123404	Whatever.
AID00123405	Don't worry about me. I can handle myself in a fight.
AID00123406	I understand.
AID00123407	Good luck.
AID00123408	I could sneak in there and try to get your people out.
AID00123409	As soon as you free them, the rest of my squad will move in and provide covering fire.
AID00123410	You should wait until it's darker so that you have the best chance to pull this off.
AID00123411	You should go now, while it's still dark. That way, you'll have the best chance to pull this off.
AID00123412	I may be able to negotiate a deal with the Great Khans.
AID00123413	Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are, but considering that the hostages are as good as dead when we attack...
AID00123414	All right, I'm going to give you a chance to talk to the Great Khans. Their leader is a man named Jessup.
AID00123415	If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in, but it'll probably be late for you.
AID00123416	I'd like to know more about the NCR.
AID00123417	That's a conversation we might be able to have some day - once you've shown more respect for my country.
AID00123418	I can provide a quick history lesson, if that's what you're looking for.
AID00123419	In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam.
AID00123420	Rangers and army scouts had confirmed that the dam was basically unoccupied and could be restored to an operable condition.
AID00123421	Upon arriving at the dam, however, they discovered that a large force of tribals and robots had occupied it.
AID00123422	This was our introduction to the Three Families, the Securitrons, and, of course, Mr. House.
AID00123423	Using his Securitrons as intermediaries, Mr. House called for parlay.
AID00123424	He claimed his forces had occupied Hoover Dam in order to safeguard it for our arrival.
AID00123425	And that he was ready to turn it over to us, so long as we could agree to terms.
AID00123426	Those terms became the Treaty of New Vegas.
AID00123427	The Treaty recognized Mr. House's sovereignty over the Strip and granted us rights to establish military bases at the Dam and McCarran Airport.
AID00123428	The NCR is legally permitted to send 95% of the electricity produced by the dam to our home states.
AID00123429	The remaining 5% goes to the Strip.
AID00123430	The treaty actually makes it illegal for the NCR to prevent its citizens, or troops on furlough, from visiting the Strip.
AID00123431	Once on the Strip, our citizens are subject to arrest - or punishment - by House's Securitrons, though that's a rare occurrence.
AID00123432	Our troops enjoy a different status. It's illegal for the Securitrons to take action against them.
AID00123433	Of course, it's also illegal for our troops to carry firearms on the Strip, so there isn't much trouble they can get into.
AID00123434	Our military police does an adequate job of keeping the troops on furlough in line. I don't envy them that task.
AID00123435	The embassy was established a few weeks after the Treaty was signed.
AID00123436	Basically Mr. House handed us a dumpy little building he had no interest in renovating.
AID00123437	I'm the third ambassador to hold this post. And the first, I think, to accept its limitations.
AID00123438	My predecessors had ambitions of engineering the annexation of the Mojave. They thought they'd convince Mr. House to join up.
AID00123439	I've never even spoken to the man - or whatever he is. Maybe the situation will change once we've beaten the Legion once and for all.
AID00123440	What's happening around the Strip?
AID00123441	If that's all you came here to talk about, you're wasting my time. Get to the point, or get out of my office.
AID00123442	I know you have a penchant for getting into trouble, but I'd recommend against that here. The Securitrons on the Strip aren't to be trifled with.
AID00123443	Perhaps I'll have Captain Pappas keep an eye on you. For your own safety, of course.
AID00123444	It's the same old stuff around here. Gambling, debauchery, drunkenness. It's all here. I'm getting a little old for it, however.
AID00123445	If you want more information try talking to some of the other guys around here. I don't get out of the office much anymore.
AID00123446	Tell me about yourself, Ambassador.
AID00123447	Interested in Politics, huh? Well, grab a seat and get comfortable.
AID00123448	I've been in politics quite a while now. Always had the drive to do it, even when I was young. It's just something I was drawn to.
AID00123449	I started my career over twenty years ago back in the NCR as the local mayor and worked my way up from there.
AID00123450	I managed President Kimball's first run for a seat on the Council. I suppose that's why I have this ambassadorship.
AID00123451	I'll see what I can do to help them.
AID00123452	Sobering them up and putting them back to work would go a long way toward helping Freeside.
AID00123453	Is there anything I can do to help?
AID00123454	There is always something needing done. A few souls here in Freeside could be great assets to the community, if they'd kick their addictions.
AID00123455	We need to get a regular supply of medicine organized, but the Crimson Caravan wants too many caps for what we need.
AID00123456	Lastly, tensions between the townies and NCR tourists have been going downhill fast lately. A lot of innocent people will get hurt if things blow up.
AID00123457	Things seem pretty rough here in Freeside.
AID00123458	More than rough, it's a damn mess. Freeside townies are constantly picking fights with NCR civilians.
AID00123459	Thugs and thieves are always looking for a victim, and the local families are just sitting back making caps on the mess.
AID00123460	Freeside is in dire need, but no one has been man enough to step up. The Followers can only do so much to stem the tide.
AID00123461	Where should I start looking?
AID00123462	In Freeside, the drunks and drug addicts flock in and around the Atomic Wrangler. I'd start there.
AID00123463	If I wanted to calm things down in Freeside, where would I start?
AID00123464	The big man around here is The King. Not much happens in Freeside that he doesn't know about.
AID00123465	He has the most influence locally, and some of his crew haven't helped the situation by harassing NCR citizens and charging double for water.
AID00123466	Some NCR soldiers have been bringing in supplies, but none of it is going to Freeside locals. I've tried to speak to both sides to no avail.
AID00123467	Tell me about Jacob.
AID00123468	The Garrets hooked Jacob on chems when he was working for them. Ironic, since he used to homebrew detox chems. He's a natural chemist.
AID00123469	Tell me about Bill Ronte.
AID00123470	Old Bill Ronte is an exceptionally skilled machinist. He could fix the problems we've been having with Freeside's water pump, if he sobered up.
AID00123471	You said something about helping addicts?
AID00123472	Yes, Old Bill Ronte and Jacob Hoff. They're not going to kick their habits on their own.
AID00123473	Do you have anything for sale?
AID00123474	Sure. Take a look.
AID00123475	Not for someone like you. My customers would shit a brick if they knew I sold anything to you.
AID00123476	If you need help cleaning up your rep around Freeside, I might be able to help... for a price.
AID00123477	I might be able to work something out.
AID00123478	Good. We can supply them with all the Med-X they need. For the Fixer, we'll only be able to send over some basic drug components.
AID00123479	We're not in the business of getting people off drugs, so we don't really dabble in that side of things.
AID00123480	The Followers should be able to whip some up with what we have available, though.
AID00123481	They just need to agree to fix up our stills and keep them maintained plus cover the cost for raw materials needed to make the alcohol.
AID00123482	The Followers need to find someone to trade with for supplies.
AID00123483	Really now? This is news. We could possibly supply what they need, but they would need to supply us in kind.
AID00123484	They have the tech know-how to make our stills work more efficiently. Purer alcohol means we can get our customers drunk quicker.
AID00123485	Getting our customers drunk quicker means more caps spent at the tables and stuffing slots if you know what I mean.
AID00123486	Plus, the extra alcohol can serve as surgical disinfectant for their needs. The Followers are a good lot. They've stitched up our boys in the past.
AID00123487	Goodbye.
AID00123488	Piss off, errand boy.
AID00123489	Piss off, errand girl.
AID00123490	<Speech>
AID00123491	[SUCCEEDED] Well, that sounds like a bit of a bargain. I get to walk free with the Garrets thinking I'm dead.
AID00123492	Sure, you can have my hat. I can always buy another with the caps I've got left.
AID00123493	It would have been more fun fighting it out, though. See you later, kid.
AID00123494	All I need is your hat, and you're a free man. I'll tell Francine you're dead.
AID00123495	[FAILED] <Glare> Better get your ass moving before your mouth gets you into trouble, kid.
AID00123496	Hand over your hat before I pump you full of hot lead, you old fart!
AID00123497	I guess I haven't got a choice but to put you away.
AID00123498	If you think you've got the guts, I'd like to see you try.
AID00123499	Nah, just thought I'd say hi.
AID00123500	Piss off.
AID00123501	Give me a share of the caps and your hat and you can go free.
AID00123502	Now why the hell should I do that? You're below me, kid.
AID00123503	I've been killing scum twice your size since before your mother squeezed you out.
AID00123504	I'm here to collect, McCaffery. No one crosses the Garret Twins.
AID00123505	I'd rather not waste the ammo, kid. But, if you insist, draw.
AID00123506	The Followers are looking to trade for supplies.
AID00123507	Interesting... Well, you're going to need to speak with my brother James. He handles all of the trading contracts and general operations.
AID00123508	VFSKingTellsRexToGoWithYou
AID00123509	Rex, this is your new master. Protect him as you would me.
AID00123510	Rex, this is your new master. Protect her as you would me.
AID00123511	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00123512	How can you afford so much alcohol?
AID00123513	Dixon sells me booze dirt cheap. It does the job, but it tastes like paint thinner and I feel like I'm going to die if I stop drinking for a day.
AID00123514	I swear that guy is trying to kill me, but what can I do? Drinking other booze doesn't cure the sickness like his.
AID00123515	Why don't you stop drinking?
AID00123516	Drop drinking?! I've been drinking for a straight month!
AID00123517	Listen, I've tried to stop, but the withdrawal symptoms are so bad I feel like I'm going to die. I can't stop now.
AID00123518	Julie Farkas sent me to help you sober up.
AID00123519	Julie? Ah, I love Julie. She's such a nice lady.
AID00123520	One time, I was working on the water pump and she came over, put her hand on my shoulder, and told me I was doing a great job. Great job she says!
AID00123521	I just choked up and didn't say nothing. Compliments are so rare these days.
AID00123522	How's business?
AID00123523	House may have boxed us out of the Strip, but we also don't have to deal with their bullshit.
AID00123524	I think now that the Followers are working with us, we'll be able to shape up Freeside a bit more.
AID00123525	With Jacob Hoff sobered up, there are new drinks are on the menu and sales are strong. People love the new Absinthe and Rum & Nuka.
AID00123526	Well, I wasn't expecting the increased NCR presence after the bombing to improve things, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
AID00123527	The off-duty chumps who have been wandering through have been stopping in to buy drinks and pay for strange. I appreciate the extra income.
AID00123528	The build-up of tension around the dam isn't making things safe, but it sure is bringing in a lot of hotheads looking to drink their worries away.
AID00123529	With the Kings dead, business is going a bit south. It's harder to get supplies into Freeside safely without their help.
AID00123530	We ain't scraping to get by, if that's what you're asking.
AID00123531	I spoke with Julie Farkas. She says the Followers will accept your offer.
AID00123532	Hey, that's great. We'll get some supplies sent over today as a show of good faith.
AID00123533	Once our stills are upgraded, we'll never be short on liquor for our patrons. If Jacob Hoff is sober, we might even have a few new drinks on tap.
AID00123534	Most might view us as drug dealing enablers around here, but honestly we care about our patrons. It's bad business for people to get addicted.
AID00123535	We've got enough crime in Freeside without a bunch of strung-out junkies robbing traders and gamblers to afford their next fix.
AID00123536	With a surplus of supplies, you could use your caps and influence to expand.
AID00123537	Good point. We wouldn't be paying anything for their supplies, just a portion of our food waste to make ethanol.
AID00123538	We get food from nearby wasteland farmers in exchange for medical services, so we could put our caps back into helping Freeside.
AID00123539	Tell the Garrets we'll keep their stills running if they provide us with supplies. Thank you for arranging this. You've been a godsend.
AID00123540	You get your chems and can help anyone who gets addicted.
AID00123541	True, we could help addicts, but the cycle of addiction, recover, and relapse would remain.
AID00123542	The Garret Twins.
AID00123543	They supply Freeside with drugs and liquor. From my point of view they're just better-organized pushers.
AID00123544	Upgrading their stills would increase their supply of liquor and chems. How does that help Freeside?
AID00123545	I think I found someone who will be able to cover your supplies.
AID00123546	That's phenomenal! Who did you find?
AID00123547	Thank you, Victor.
AID00123548	I see you brought a friend! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
AID00123549	I see you brought some friends! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
AID00123550	Come back soon, now!
AID00123551	Enjoy your visit!
AID00123552	The troopers are all dead. You're free to go.
AID00123553	Yeah, that's a pretty piece of work. Makes me wonder why you'd turn on the NCR, especially when they had us cold.
AID00123554	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AID00123555	Well, I've got that right here.
AID00123556	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
AID00123557	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they will help me through this.
AID00123558	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
AID00123559	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they will help me through this.
AID00123560	Bill, I've got what you asked for.
AID00123561	What do you need?
AID00123562	At least a couple doses of Fixer, a bottle of whiskey, and Rad-Away.
AID00123563	I can take doses of Fixer and Rad-Away to gradually flush my system over time while drinking decreasing shots of diluted whiskey.
AID00123564	This shit better be worth it, man.
AID00123565	You need to kick the habit, Bill. I can help you.
AID00123566	The only way you can help me now is a load of detox chems.
AID00123567	You won't be seeing Dixon anymore.
AID00123568	What the hell? Why? I need alcohol, man!
AID00123569	I'm gonna die if I don't get a drink!
AID00123570	Nevermind.  I don't have enough to cover that.
AID00123571	Heh, you sorry sad sack.  Come back when you've got the caps.
AID00123572	<Speech>
AID00123573	[SUCCEEDED] Wait, man! You can't go around saying shit like that!
AID00123574	Okay, I get your point. You won't have to worry about me supplying those two any more.
AID00123575	So the NCR is supplying you with cheap chems? To keep Freeside down?
AID00123576	[FAILED] Wow, you really suck at this don't you? Go bully some molerats, jackass.
AID00123577	If you don't leave them alone...  I'll...  I'll tell on you!
AID00123578	All right.  Take the caps and leave them alone.
AID00123579	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mr. Moneybags.
AID00123580	Good luck getting them healthy.  If they don't get a whole lot of fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
AID00123581	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mrs. Moneybags.
AID00123582	Good luck getting them healthy.  If they don't get a whole lot of fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
AID00123583	<Attack>
AID00123584	Ooo, I always enjoy a good scrap!
AID00123585	<Attack> Screw that.  It'd be a lot cheaper and easier for me to kill you.
AID00123586	Maybe some caps could persuade you to leave them alone?
AID00123587	300 caps and I'll stop selling to them. Otherwise, it is just too much fun watching them spiral downward.
AID00123588	I need you to stop supplying Bill and Jacob.
AID00123589	Really? Aw, you're such a saint.
AID00123590	You know what? I might be willing to stop if there is something in it for me.
AID00123591	Do you know anything about Bill or Jacob?
AID00123592	Yeah, man. Those cats are out of their domes addicted to my shit. They can't get enough. Pretty hilarious to watch.
AID00123593	I'll advance you a hundred caps and then... wait, I don't have that much on me.
AID00123594	A hundred caps? I have that much between the cushions of my day bed.
AID00123595	Come back when you've got a serious offer.
AID00123596	Uh... how about you give me your recipes and then we'll see.
AID00123597	Yes, of course.
AID00123598	[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
AID00123599	Yes. We're a major publisher. But as a sign of good faith I'll need recipes.
AID00123600	<grunts> You're pushing your luck. Here. I have a few copies on me. This better be good enough.
AID00123601	We're going to have a real problem if this thing isn't a hit.
AID00123602	It'll be huge. I'll advance you a hundred caps, plus half the gross.
AID00123603	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Don't get me wrong, I love my job here, but they don't pay me what I'm worth. Too many people skimming off the top.
AID00123604	Take these. Should be plenty for a book in there. That's all I'm giving. Don't expect me to write some fancy introduction.
AID00123605	[Attack] I just stopped by to kill you.
AID00123606	I was just wondering where I could find tonight's wines.
AID00123607	Well why don't you fucking try checking the serving table in the wine room, for fuck's sake? Circular room, two rooms down? Ring any bells? Christ!
AID00123608	Now don't speak to me again or I swear I'll serve you as the main course.
AID00123609	You go do that, then.
AID00123610	How could they treat me like that?
AID00123611	What about the banquet?
AID00123612	Forget about the fucking banquet. You know what? You can do it. You be the star chef. Take my recipes.
AID00123613	It won't fill the hole, though. Just remember that. You'll always feel empty.
AID00123614	You may be projecting. Tell me more about your parents.
AID00123615	[?] Oh. I see how it is. You think because my father walked out on us when I was five, now I have to yell at people.
AID00123616	Or because my mother was a deranged chem fiend who regularly brought strange men home who told me to call them uncle.
AID00123617	Or because my sisters would lock me in a shipping crate when they didn't want me around... and my brother...
AID00123618	God, I'd forgotten about that. How could they do that to me?
AID00123619	[SUCCEEDED] I... I can't stay here. I need to be alone.
AID00123620	That's right. I don't work for you.
AID00123621	I'm a new honorary member of the White Glove Society.
AID00123622	Well what do you want? I'm very busy here.
AID00123623	Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past.
AID00123624	[?] What kind of harebrained fucking psychobabble bullshit is that?
AID00123625	I yell at people because I like yelling at people and because they fucking deserve it. Not because Mumsy and Daddy-kins didn't hug me enough.
AID00123626	You're screwed up in the head.
AID00123627	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around his precious feelings.
AID00123628	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around her precious feelings.
AID00123629	Hey, could I, uh, buy some of your recipes?
AID00123630	Yes, of course.
AID00123631	[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
AID00123632	<Lie> I'm here to talk business.  Interested in putting out a cookbook?
AID00123633	[SUCCEEDED] What, me? The supreme ruler of the Nevada dining scene? Teach lowlife half-wits to make food that doesn't smell like burning excrement?
AID00123634	Do you think it would sell?
AID00123635	<Lie> Oh no, you have it right. I'm a server.
AID00123636	Well then why the fuck are you still standing there like you aren't the lowest form of life ever to be flushed down the evolutionary toilet?
AID00123637	[Attack] You'll be feeding birds when I'm through with you.
AID00123638	I'll carve that stupid look off your inbred face!
AID00123639	Now get the hell out of my sight, or I'll bathe your face in the deep fryer.
AID00123640	I'll go back to my job now.
AID00123641	Would you like me to try to get you out of your contract?
AID00123642	You'd do that? For me? I'm not sure what can be done, but you'd be doing me a solid if you would. I've been talking to Big Sal mostly.
AID00123643	That's it for now.
AID00123644	See ya.
AID00123645	Let's talk about something else.
AID00123646	What do you wanna talk about?
AID00123647	I have a couple more questions about what happened that night.
AID00123648	Alright, have at it.
AID00123649	<Medicine Options>
AID00123650	[SUCCEEDED] What? Yeah, you're right. I wonder what was up with that.
AID00123651	That doesn't sound like enough to get you to lose the whole night.
AID00123652	[FAILED] I've done much more than that in a single night and lived to tell the tale.
AID00123653	Um... Wouldn't that make your heart explode or something?
AID00123654	That seems like a lot of chems.
AID00123655	Like I said, pretty standard for me. I can handle my shit.
AID00123656	How did the family find out about it?
AID00123657	When I saw the body I started screaming, a few seconds some of their soldiers were in there cleaning up the room.
AID00123658	They offered to keep silent about what happened if I agreed to help them get their hands on large quantities of guns, at deep discounts.
AID00123659	What kind of chems were you doing?
AID00123660	That night? Mostly buffout, I like to cut it with a little bit of jet, and wash it down with some whiskey. That was my standard Saturday night...
AID00123661	Do you know where the knife came from?
AID00123662	I keep a little switchblade tucked away with me. You never know when you might find some trouble.
AID00123663	About that thing you wanted to talk about, let's hear it.
AID00123664	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible. The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that's going on, and I need someone like you to help me.
AID00123665	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
AID00123666	And if you prove to be a loyal and capable agent, well... let's just say there's a lot of work to be done, and the NCR is a good friend to have.
AID00123667	To the Northeast is a settlement. The locals here call them Boomers. They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
AID00123668	I would like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
AID00123669	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
AID00123670	I don't think it's going to work out. Sorry.
AID00123671	That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
AID00123672	Uh... no word yet. I'll get back to you on it.
AID00123673	You know where to find me.
AID00123674	Uh... I'm not sure. I'll get back to you.
AID00123675	Let me know as soon as you have an answer from them.
AID00123676	Yes... they will help... "us."
AID00123677	That's great. They're going to give us an advantage in the battle ahead.
AID00123678	The Boomers have agreed to help me.
AID00123679	Excellent work. I can't tell you how useful that will be.
AID00123680	In any event, I have another assignment ready and waiting for you. But we can speak of it later.
AID00123681	Rest up, and when you're ready, speak to me again.
AID00123682	I'll find them and talk to them.
AID00123683	Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, let me know what they have to say.
AID00123684	I know where they are. I'll go and talk to them.
AID00123685	Excellent, come back after you've spoken to them. They should see the benefits of helping us in the long-term.
AID00123686	I've met with the Boomers. I don't think it'll work out.
AID00123687	That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
AID00123688	Actually, I already know them. We're good friends.
AID00123689	That's excellent news! So they'll help us?
AID00123690	Sorry, I'm not interested.
AID00123691	Sorry to hear that. Do me a favor and give it some more thought. I'll be here if you change your mind.
AID00123692	I'm listening.
AID00123693	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible so we don't waste each other's time.
AID00123694	The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that is going on with Mr. House and the Legion.
AID00123695	And despite your reputation and previous actions with the NCR, we could use your help.
AID00123696	I'm sure you've noticed that things are a little tense around here with all the issues between the NCR, the Legion, and Mr. House.
AID00123697	It doesn't take a genius to see that something big is going to happen soon.
AID00123698	To be honest with you, the NCR is in a tight spot. But... if we fail now, it's the people here that are going to suffer the most.
AID00123699	I'm not willing to let that happen, and I don't think you're the kind of person that would either.
AID00123700	<VMS23 Boomer Quest>
AID00123701	I'm glad you could make it! I have something that I wanted to discuss with you.
AID00123702	It's a very important matter, and I have a strong feeling that you're the perfect person for the job.
AID00123703	You received my message, good. I realize that it may seem a little strange that I'm contacting you, considering your reputation...
AID00123704	But I have a business proposition to discuss with you.
AID00123705	Ah, I see you received my message. Good, good - I had something important to discuss with you.
AID00123706	I wanted to talk to you about the Boomers.
AID00123707	I'm glad to see you've given it some thought. Are you willing to go talk to them?
AID00123708	Thanks for doing this. Remember, we need their resources to help us in the upcoming battle. Do whatever it takes.
AID00123709	I hope you've returned with good news. Are they willing to help the NCR?
AID00123710	What's the word with the Boomers? Have you talked with them yet?
AID00123711	VMS18MortimerBanquetSpeech
AID00123712	I know I'm not the scheduled speaker, but I have a few words, if I may.
AID00123713	There was a time not so long ago when we were bound together not as members but as family. As a clan.
AID00123714	And when Mr. House came to us with his proposal, we accepted, knowing we stood to gain much.
AID00123715	Little did we know how much we'd lose in the process.
AID00123716	As a society, we've endeavored to sample the finest food and drink the world has to offer. But we are living a lie.
AID00123717	There is a meat sweeter than the most cornfed livestock. Most of you have tasted it. All of you have coveted it.
AID00123718	Among us, it is a crime to discuss a return to the old ways that unified our people.
AID00123719	Tonight, that all changes. The taboo ends. Let me finish, Marjorie.
AID00123720	You don't know it yet, but you are all now guilty of a greater crime. One that ordinarily bears the harshest of punishments.
AID00123721	Surely that you are all guilty warrants not only universal amnesty but also a renewed discussion.
AID00123722	For our society to be truly elite, we must dine on the most delicious, the most exclusive food known to us.
AID00123723	And tonight, for the first time as a society, you are sampling that very dish, the meat we are forbidden to taste, the way it was meant to be eaten!
AID00123724	Fellow members of the White Glove Society, bon appetit!
AID00123725	Never mind.
AID00123726	Very well.
AID00123727	Time to serve the meal.
AID00123728	At once.
AID00123729	But no one is in their chairs yet. Surely we should wait until 7 when the dinner guests arrive.
AID00123730	I'll be ready when you need me.
AID00123731	The wine is ready to be brought out.
AID00123732	Right away.
AID00123733	But no one is in their chairs yet. Surely we should wait until 7 when the dinner guests arrive.
AID00123734	I'll be ready when you need me.
AID00123735	Would you, uh, go step in the pantry for a minute?
AID00123736	[FAILED] Now why the fuck would I do that? I don't have time for games. Stop wasting my time.
AID00123737	I think I saw a radroach in the pantry. You should check it out.
AID00123738	[SUCCEEDED] No! It'll ruin my ingredients!
AID00123739	My mistake. Let's discuss other things.
AID00123740	What's the concrete used for?
AID00123741	The NCR has been constructing bunkers up and down the river. From what I've heard, it's a little late for that.
AID00123742	Travelers over at the 188 - just up the road - said that the Legion has overrun a couple of towns to the south.
AID00123743	Tell me about Boulder City.
AID00123744	Most of the town is rubble - destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam - and the only other thing around here is the concrete mixing yard.
AID00123745	Change the subject.
AID00123746	How have you stayed alive all this time?
AID00123747	Let's just say it was very... costly. But I was willing to make the sacrifices longevity entailed, financial and otherwise.
AID00123748	Use Medicine skill to surmise House's condition.
AID00123749	[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several text books...
AID00123750	Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer to others, such as yourself.
AID00123751	The lifespan you're claiming is impossible, except for ghouls and super mutants.
AID00123752	[FAILED] No. While brains demonstrated some use as organic processors in the robots produced by General Atomics International...
AID00123753	They never retained personality once removed from the human body.
AID00123754	You must be, like... a brain in a jar!
AID00123755	You appear to be a computer, not a man.
AID00123756	Don't let the video screens and computer terminals fool you. I'm flesh and blood, not silicon.
AID00123757	Use [Speech] to press Mr. House about the Chip.
AID00123758	[SUCCEEDED] You might keep an eye out for any computers that Benny's been using. Maybe even a computer lab of some sort...
AID00123759	The more I know about the Chip, the easier I can find it...
AID00123760	[FAILED] You have a contract to fulfill, a delivery to make.
AID00123761	If you can't hold to a contract, simply for the ethic of holding to a contract, you're worthless to me.
AID00123762	The less I know, the less I care. Know what I mean?
AID00123763	Tell me about the factions vying for New Vegas.
AID00123764	It's understandable that you'd be curious about this topic, but we'll hold off until the Platinum Chip has been recovered.
AID00123765	Who exactly are you, Mr. House?
AID00123766	I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
AID00123767	I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
AID00123768	Before the Great War of 2077, I was the founder, President and CEO of RobCo Industries, a vast computer and robotics corporation.
AID00123769	What was your relationship with Benny... back when he was breathing?
AID00123770	Benny was the leader of the Chairmen for seven years, ever since I recruited the tribe. I considered him something of a protege.
AID00123771	Ask about the Chip. (Recovered)
AID00123772	What is the Platinum Chip?
AID00123773	It's a very special item. There's nothing else like it in the entire world. It was lost a long time, and difficult to find.
AID00123774	That's all you need to know about it, for this stage of our enterprise. Fulfill your contract, deliver the Chip, and good things will come your way.
AID00123775	Tell me about Benny.
AID00123776	Benny has led the Chairmen ever since I recruited his tribe seven years ago.
AID00123777	Until his recent misbehavior, I'd planned to make him my protege. Maybe if I'd begun grooming him sooner, none of this would've happened...
AID00123778	What terms are you offering?
AID00123779	My only concern is the recovery of the Platinum Chip. What happens to Benny, I leave to your discretion.
AID00123780	When you bring the Chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
AID00123781	As I said before, Benny's fate is yours to decide. Once you've delivered the Chip, I will pay you the amount agreed-upon.
AID00123782	Tell me your terms again?
AID00123783	What are your plans for New Vegas?
AID00123784	I've resurrected Vegas, spirit intact. What I need now is the ability to enforce my rightful claim.
AID00123785	Not just against Caesar's Legion, by the way. In fact, the NCR is a more present and insidious threat.
AID00123786	To enforce, one must have force - a position of strength.
AID00123787	Years ago, when I detected NCR scouts roaming the Mojave, I could tell from their uniforms that these were no mere tribesmen.
AID00123788	I knew it was only a matter of time before an army appeared, to take control of the dam. And I knew my Securitrons wouldn't be enough to oppose them.
AID00123789	And so I recruited the Three Families. Vegas belongs to me because I mustered enough strength to bring the NCR to the bargaining table.
AID00123790	How do you intend to enforce your claim on the city?
AID00123791	Indeed it was - and still is. But not without taking significant casualties.
AID00123792	Would Kimball and Oliver have traded the lives of hundreds of soldiers for absolute control of Hoover Dam? Oh yes.
AID00123793	They weren't afraid of me, they were afraid of Caesar - that attacking me would leave them vulnerable to a Legion offensive.
AID00123794	And so they negotiated. Not out of the kindness of their hearts, as they try to make it seem. Because the calculus of power left no other choice.
AID00123795	Wasn't the NCR's army big enough to defeat your Securitrons and the Three Families?
AID00123796	NCR forces were permitted to occupy Hoover Dam and establish a military base at McCarran Airport. Well, it used to be one.
AID00123797	They recognized my sovereignty over the Vegas Strip and agreed to supply electricity and water once their engineers repaired the dam.
AID00123798	Written into the treaty were provisions that the NCR do nothing to prevent its soldiers and civilians from visiting the Strip.
AID00123799	That's how I harnessed the NCR to my endeavor. Their occupation has been the engine of my growing economy.
AID00123800	What were the terms of your treaty with the NCR?
AID00123801	The salient issue is that they will go to war with me, if given the chance.
AID00123802	There's just one reason why the NCR hasn't contrived some outrage to justify invading the Strip - Caesar's Legion.
AID00123803	The final battle between those two armies is fast approaching. I can't afford to let either side win on their terms.
AID00123804	You would go to war against the NCR?
AID00123805	New Vegas is more than a city - it's the remedy to mankind's derailment.
AID00123806	The city's economy is a blast furnace in which can be forged the steel of a new rail line, running straight to a new horizon.
AID00123807	What is the NCR? A society of people desperate to experience comfort, ease, luxury... A society of customers.
AID00123808	With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.
AID00123809	100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.
AID00123810	Say you keep control of New Vegas. What happens next?
AID00123811	I prefer the term "autocrat."
AID00123812	I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity.
AID00123813	Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.
AID00123814	In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?
AID00123815	My judgement.
AID00123816	I have no interest in abusing others, just as I have no interest in legislating or otherwise dictating what people do in their private time.
AID00123817	Nor have I any interest in being worshipped as some kind of machine god messiah. I am impervious to such corrupting ambitions.
AID00123818	But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have.
AID00123819	What's to keep you from abusing your power?
AID00123820	What's your story, Mr. House?
AID00123821	Yes, I have some questions I want to ask.
AID00123822	I'll return when I have the Chip.
AID00123823	Until then.
AID00123824	Still not interested.
AID00123825	All right, I'll do it.
AID00123826	The Chip is worth far more than that.
AID00123827	1250 caps? I accept your terms.
AID00123828	How do I get to Benny?
AID00123829	[Barter] for better terms.
AID00123830	[SUCCEEDED] Very well, five times the bonus. Not one cap more.
AID00123831	It's a good start... but well below market price.
AID00123832	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
AID00123833	I've always taken business negotiations very seriously. I advise you to do the same.
AID00123834	Raise your price or... or, uh... you're "chip outta luck."
AID00123835	No thanks.
AID00123836	My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligate you to deliver the Chip.
AID00123837	1000 caps? I accept your terms.
AID00123838	Well enough.  Return to me when you have the Platinum Chip in your possession. Any final matters for us to discuss?
AID00123839	I have some questions to ask first.
AID00123840	What are you proposing?
AID00123841	This doesn't interest me. I should be leaving.
AID00123842	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00123843	What do you propose?
AID00123844	VFSOrrisCursesThug
AID00123845	You idiot! What part of "play dead" do you not understand?
AID00123846	VFSOrrisCursesPlayer
AID00123847	It's regrettable, but it looks like I'm about to lose another customer.
AID00123848	VFSOrrisTurnsOnPlayer
AID00123849	VFSThugCursesOrris
AID00123850	Okay, that's it. Orris isn't paying us enough to put up with this shit. Let's just kill this one and be done with it.
AID00123851	VFSOrrisAfterCombat
AID00123852	Nothing to worry about. If you had hired one of those other hacks, you'd be up to your ass in lowlife right about now.
AID00123853	VFSOrrisLeaveThemToMe
AID00123854	Leave them to me!
AID00123855	VFSOrrisFinalStretch
AID00123856	That was rather invigorating, wasn't it? Let's keep moving, it's only a little further to the gate.
AID00123857	VFSOrrisIveGotThis
AID00123858	Gotcha! Thought you could ambush us, huh?
AID00123859	VFSOrrisThisWay
AID00123860	I'll scout ahead. You follow at a distance.
AID00123861	VFSOrrisEnd01
AID00123862	Well, here we are. No worse for wear, are you? I trust that if you need to cross Freeside again, you'll know who to hire.
AID00123863	Well, here we are. I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about the topic we were just discussing, or else.
AID00123864	VFSOrrisWarning01
AID00123865	Hey, slow down. I don't like the look of some of those men ahead. Let's take a different way around.
AID00123866	I've changed my mind.
AID00123867	No, you haven't.
AID00123868	This is the second time you've promised to deliver the Platinum Chip. Even if you don't hold yourself to your promises, I will.
AID00123869	Never mind. Goodbye.
AID00123870	Please focus on the task at hand - for both our sakes.
AID00123871	I need to ask some questions before I recover the Chip.
AID00123872	No, I'm still not interested.
AID00123873	You signed a contract in good faith to deliver that Chip. You're going to have a hard time on the Strip if you are so incautious of making enemies...
AID00123874	I have some questions to ask first.
AID00123875	What were your terms again?
AID00123876	I'll recover the Chip.
AID00123877	No thanks, not interested.
AID00123878	So you've said before. You're making a habit of wasting my time.
AID00123879	Maybe. I have some questions I want to ask.
AID00123880	Yes, let's get down to business.
AID00123881	Actually, never mind. Stealth is more my style.
AID00123882	I think I'd rather try negotiations, instead.
AID00123883	All right. Get ready to cover me once I've freed them.
AID00123884	Goodbye.
AID00123885	Okay. See you soon!
AID00123886	20 caps for a crappy rat-hole? C'mon, you can do better than that.
AID00123887	[FAILED] What? A crappy... rat-hole!? My vault!? You are cruisin' for a bruisin', shuckster! The price stays.
AID00123888	Sarah, I plan on staying here often - got a special price for a special client?
AID00123889	[SUCCEEDED] Well. Sure! You seem pretty special. But that will be our secret, okay?
AID00123890	On second thought, I don't need a room right now.
AID00123891	Okay! How can I help you?
AID00123892	Okay. 20 caps sounds good.
AID00123893	Go all the way down to the Vault's main hub. Your room's in the hallway to the left. Enjoy your stay!
AID00123894	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
AID00123895	I have Vault gear for you.
AID00123896	You do? That's wonderful! Let's see what you brought.
AID00123897	All right! That's going to net you lots of caps, my friend. Do you want to trade all your vault suits right now?
AID00123898	There are some things I wanted to know about you.
AID00123899	I see. Okay, your move.
AID00123900	I would like to ask you some questions about Vault 21.
AID00123901	All right! What would you like to know?
AID00123902	Let's see what you have for sale.
AID00123903	Take a look at this.
AID00123904	Are you the owner of this hotel and shop?
AID00123905	Well... it is my vault, all right. I mean, yeah. That is, no.
AID00123906	I take care of it but I suppose you could say that it belongs to Mr. House.
AID00123907	What kinds of things do you sell in this gift shop?
AID00123908	I have all sorts of things. Vault souvenirs, vault wares, vault machines, vault mementos and vault suits! And, well, lots of other vault things, too.
AID00123909	A vault hotel? Was it like this before the war?
AID00123910	No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
AID00123911	I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
AID00123912	Not that I know much of the world - I never left this place, come to think of it... but it is the most special vault, ever!
AID00123913	I would like a room, please.
AID00123914	All right! We have an available room for you. That will be just 20 caps.
AID00123915	A special room for a special client!
AID00123916	For The Strip VIPs, like you, I've got just the right room - at half the price.
AID00123917	My shop's open for you, but not my Vault. I don't need trouble-makers staying at my home, no thanks.
AID00123918	Having you tonight is my pleasure. Your room is ready!
AID00123919	<VMS23 Note Dialog>
AID00123920	Hey, you there! I have a message for you.
AID00123921	It's from Ambassador Crocker. Very important. Here you go.
AID00123922	No deal.
AID00123923	It's not my problem. I don't care what you do.
AID00123924	[Attack] He'll never know, because I'm going to kill you.
AID00123925	[Attack] Doesn't matter. I'm going to finish what they started.
AID00123926	The hell you will.
AID00123927	I could always leave you here if you aren't going to listen.
AID00123928	All right, all right. But there's gonna be some justice one way or another. I'll see to that.
AID00123929	Let's go. I'll be right behind you.
AID00123930	You're right. Let's make sure they're all killed.
AID00123931	Damn right, I'm right.
AID00123932	All right, let's get out while the getting's good.
AID00123933	You should have them all killed. It would serve them right.
AID00123934	I never liked them White Shoes in the first place. We'd be doing the Strip a service.
AID00123935	Let's go. I'll be right behind you.
AID00123936	The White Glove Society isn't to blame. Just Mortimer and a few others.
AID00123937	To hell with that. You've seen those freaks. They dress the same, talk the same. You can bet they all eat the same, too.
AID00123938	They deserve what my daddy's gonna have coming for them.
AID00123939	<Lie> I don't know who did this.
AID00123940	Some members of the White Glove Society. They were going to eat you.
AID00123941	What in the sam hell? Eat me? What kind of sick bastards would eat a person?
AID00123942	I'll tell you what. Soon as I'm out of here and my daddy knows the story, you can bet there ain't gonna be no White Hat Society no more.
AID00123943	There's no time to explain. We have to go now.
AID00123944	All right, fine. I'm right behind you.
AID00123945	Calm down. I've come to get you out of here.
AID00123946	My daddy sent you?
AID00123947	Goddamn it, I almost died in here! What the hell took you so long? It's just one damn hotel.
AID00123948	Who did this to me, anyway? They hit me over the head before I got a look at 'em.
AID00123949	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
AID00123950	Okay, what's on your mind?
AID00123951	Something about his story doesn't sit right with me.
AID00123952	What? That he's a murdering Jet-head? Not a new story around here.
AID00123953	Actually, I'd like to see about getting him out of his obligations to you.
AID00123954	Why would I want to do that?
AID00123955	What kind of business do you do here?
AID00123956	We run a hotel. What do you think our business is?
AID00123957	I'd like to talk to you about Troike.
AID00123958	Ah, Troike? What's he want? Some more Jet, a fresh batch of girls? Maybe a guy or two this time?
AID00123959	My associate Big Sal deals with Troike and his business. When my shift down here is done you can talk to him.
AID00123960	Um, nevermind. Sorry I said something.
AID00123961	Damn right you're sorry.
AID00123962	<Speech Option 2, low skill>
AID00123963	[SUCCEEDED] I guess if Cachino trusts you I can tell you a little of what happened. It all started with a prostitute in here.
AID00123964	Cachino forgot to tell me what they have on you.
AID00123965	[FAILED] No way, man. I don't want to think about it, much less talk about it.
AID00123966	Err... I know what they have on you... Well I know, but I forgot. Tell me again.
AID00123967	<Speech Option>
AID00123968	[SUCCEEDED] Great. So I'm fucked either way. I guess I don't have any choice but to help you. Just try not to get me killed here.
AID00123969	<Lie> If you don't help me, I'll report your work here to NCR.
AID00123970	[FAILED] Nothing you could do scares me as much as the Omertas.
AID00123971	Tell me what you know or I'll, um... break your nose.
AID00123972	Maybe I can help you out of your contract with the family.
AID00123973	More power to you if you can, but keep me out of it. I've been doing business with Big Sal, so he's going to be your man.
AID00123974	I'm looking to help Cachino break up whatever the Bosses are planning.
AID00123975	Yeah? Well fuck that. The bosses have my number, and I'm a company man while they've got the goods on me.
AID00123976	Here, Benny - special delivery. <Punch Benny in the face.>
AID00123977	Seems you need to work on your marksmanship.
AID00123978	I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare. Or are you just thick-skulled?
AID00123979	Either way, baby, this is good news. Maybe I can finally sleep at night, knowing you didn't die.
AID00123980	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny. <Attack.>
AID00123981	Cash me outta this mess!
AID00123982	I want the Platinum Chip and I want it now.
AID00123983	I can't do that, baby, and you know it. There's a lot of angles to this caper - complexities aplenty.
AID00123984	But plenty of action, too - enough for both of us. But we don't jabber about that out here in public.
AID00123985	[Black Widow] and options.
AID00123986	You making a pass at me, sister? Because I'm out of your league.
AID00123987	When you shot me, you ran off so fast I never got your name.
AID00123988	Did those bullets scramble your egg? Or have you always been a naughty broad...?
AID00123989	Is it wrong to want a guy who'd shoot me in the head?
AID00123990	You're one sick pussycat, baby. There's quins and then there's... I don't even know what to call you.
AID00123991	Girls like bad boys. And you've been downright awful.
AID00123992	I hear "dig" from you, babe, and all I can think of is a shovel. How can this be? This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.
AID00123993	I'm saying I dig you, despite it all. What do you say?
AID00123994	All right, honey baby, this is all kinds of wrong, but to my suite it is. Thirteenth floor. Don't keep me waiting.
AID00123995	I'm a courier, remember? Don't you want me to handle your package?
AID00123996	Wow-ee wow wow, girl. This is all kinds of wrong, but I'm in for a dozen.
AID00123997	You stole my package. Let's see what I can do with yours.
AID00123998	This
AID00123999	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
AID00124000	You want a reason, how about four?
AID00124001	They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
AID00124002	Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
AID00124003	Anyhow, baby, you didn't come here for vengeance. You came to get clued in.
AID00124004	What's the story with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
AID00124005	Tell Benny to give you the Chip.
AID00124006	I'm wondering why I shouldn't just kill you.
AID00124007	You've got a crazy drop on me here, baby, that's for sure. If killing's what you came for, this would be the time.
AID00124008	But baby - you'd be disappointing me. All the trouble you went through to arrange this shin-dig? Must be something more you're after...?
AID00124009	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny.
AID00124010	What's the story with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
AID00124011	What do you need me to do?
AID00124012	I was hoping you might have some work for me.
AID00124013	Maybe so. Maybe so. You look like you might be able to handle yourself. Tell you what.
AID00124014	You do me a favor, and I'll have some more work for you when it's done. Sound good?
AID00124015	I did have something, but some friends of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
AID00124016	I did have something, but a close friend of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
AID00124017	Do you always charge people to come talk to you?
AID00124018	Charge? Ha ha. Pace must be at it again. What did he take you for?
AID00124019	Actually, the White Glove Society is responsible. They're all cannibals.
AID00124020	But, but, but... that's so unfair. You should only punish the man who did it.
AID00124021	[FAILED] No, that ain't enough. It ain't just him. It's this hotel. It's the whole damn Strip, and everybody who takes their money here.
AID00124022	I sensed it when I got here. This place is evil, pure and simple. Everyone did their part. Ted getting taken was just a symptom of the disease.
AID00124023	That sounds like a fantastic idea.
AID00124024	Sometimes I got me so many ideas, it's a wonder they don't all just burst outta my head.
AID00124025	This town's headed to perdition anyway. I'm just giving them a little push.
AID00124026	That's just what they'd want. You'd be driving the city to eat each other.
AID00124027	[SUCCEEDED] I don't like this place. Whole Strip, really. Ever since I got here, the stink of it... it's flooded my nostrils.
AID00124028	But you got a point. They're already hell-bent on depravity here. All I'd be doing is helping them along.
AID00124029	Let's not be hasty. You don't have to punish the entire Strip.
AID00124030	The heck I don't! It's their support that gives these bastards power.
AID00124031	They all oughtta suffer for what they done. I just won't be satisfied with anything less. Wouldn't be enough.
AID00124032	My mind's made up on this. I'm cutting off the food supply to the Strip. They gotta learn their lesson the hard way, looks like.
AID00124033	Your son is confused. He doesn't know what he's saying.
AID00124034	You better be right. Cause I got me a mind to wipe this town off the map if some of the folks running it are to blame.
AID00124035	Well who did this, if it wasn't the White Gloves?
AID00124036	You can blame the White Glove Society. They're all cannibals.
AID00124037	Well that does it! None of them maniacs will ever do business with Heck Gunderson long as they live.
AID00124038	Hell, I'll put me together a damn blockade. Hit 'em where it hurts.
AID00124039	They control the food? Well there ain't gonna be no food. Not for anybody in this whole damn town.
AID00124040	It's a goddamned monument to inhumanity. Let 'em starve. Biggest favor anyone's ever done this hellhole.
AID00124041	<Lie> I don't know who took him. I just found him.
AID00124042	Confound it! I just don't know how I'm supposed to sleep knowing whoever done this got away.
AID00124043	All right. Well, I promised you I'd make it worth your while, so here you are.
AID00124044	Try not to lose it all at the same casino.
AID00124045	It was Mortimer, one of the White Gloves, who had Ted taken. He's a cannibal.
AID00124046	VMS18TedReturned
AID00124047	Oh my god! Ted! Are you all right?
AID00124048	Quit your hollering. I'm fine.
AID00124049	Listen, Pa, we got to go after the White Shoes or whatever they're called. They're the ones responsible.
AID00124050	I would like to hear again about the items you sell here.
AID00124051	I have all sorts of things. Vault souvenirs, vault wares, vault machines, vault mementos and vault suits! And, well, lots of other vault things, too.
AID00124052	You said that Vault 21 wasn't always a hotel?
AID00124053	No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
AID00124054	Actually, I don't have enough for that right now.
AID00124055	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00124056	Actually, I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00124057	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00124058	Here you go, 10 caps.
AID00124059	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
AID00124060	Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
AID00124061	What do I need to do to get in?
AID00124062	If you are unable to meet the minimum balance requirement, an official passport is an acceptable alternative.
AID00124063	<Science>
AID00124064	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
AID00124065	Thank you, sir.  You may proceed.
AID00124066	1C 3C R34 M.
AID00124067	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
AID00124068	Thank you, madam.  You may proceed.
AID00124069	1C 3C R34 M.
AID00124070	[FAILED] Please submit to a credit check or present a passport.
AID00124071	Robot!  Let me past!
AID00124072	[Passport] I've got a passport.
AID00124073	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
AID00124074	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
AID00124075	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
AID00124076	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
AID00124077	I'll submit to the credit check. <2,000 caps required.>
AID00124078	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
AID00124079	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
AID00124080	I'm sorry, but your balance does not meet the minimum balance.
AID00124081	Credit check? What's that for?
AID00124082	Admission to the Strip requires an official passport or proof that you are carrying the required minimum balance.
AID00124083	These policies prevent less-reputable persons from entering and ensure a good time will be had by all who enter the Strip.
AID00124084	RadAway.
AID00124085	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
AID00124086	Fixer.
AID00124087	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
AID00124088	A stimpak.
AID00124089	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
AID00124090	You said you could spare some supplies?
AID00124091	Sure. Would you like a Stimpak, Fixer, or Rad-Away?
AID00124092	Well, now that Jacob is dead, we don't have the extra resources to make a surplus of medical supplies. Sorry, but we cannot spare anything now.
AID00124093	I helped with that addiction problem you mentioned.
AID00124094	I saw them. Thank you so much for helping them. This means a lot to the Followers of the Apocalypse. You have our thanks.
AID00124095	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a stim or fixer once a day.
AID00124096	I saw Bill, but found Jacob Dead. His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
AID00124097	Thank you for helping Bill. At least he will help repair things around here.
AID00124098	I saw Jacob, but found Bill dead... His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
AID00124099	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a stim or fixer once a day.
AID00124100	No you didn't! They're both dead!
AID00124101	I don't know what you're pulling here, but this is not the way to win us over.
AID00124102	Goodbye.
AID00124103	See you.
AID00124104	I want to help you get well, Jacob.
AID00124105	Fine. If you really care so much, then get me some shots of Fixer to calm down these shakes.
AID00124106	I'm gonna need at least ten shots to get me through the week. From there the Followers should be able to help.
AID00124107	Sorry, Bill, but I still don't have the meds yet.
AID00124108	I don't have that on me right now.
AID00124109	Withdrawal could kill me if I don't get them soon.
AID00124110	I took care of that dealer. Now you can clean up.
AID00124111	What?! I need a fix now!
AID00124112	You look pretty bad, Jacob. You should probably stop using chems.
AID00124113	Why stop? I feel great!
AID00124114	No worries. My guy will be here soon enough, just wait.
AID00124115	Julie Farkas says you could use some help.
AID00124116	Julie is a saint, but I don't need help. I feel young and strong, as long as I get my chems.
AID00124117	What can you tell me about Captain Pappas?
AID00124118	She may be a bit of a hardass, but she's the best damn Captain we've had here. I'd be careful around her. You don't want to get on her bad side.
AID00124119	If you're digging for dirt on the Captain, you're digging in the wrong place.
AID00124120	What do you know about the Ambassador?
AID00124121	He's a little stiff and stuffy. Doesn't leave the office that much, always surrounds himself with papers and reports.
AID00124122	I've always wanted to play a prank on him, but there's no way I could ever pull that off without getting in trouble from Captain Pappas.
AID00124123	Sorry. I don't know much about him. We run in different circles, you know?
AID00124124	Tell me about yourself.
AID00124125	What have you heard? I know people think I'm a little on the wild side, but I'm just trying to have fun, you know?
AID00124126	Just because I happen to get into fights and like to pull pranks doesn't mean anything.
AID00124127	What's happening on the Strip?
AID00124128	Us troopers mostly come to the Strip for our R&R. We blow off some steam by gambling, drinking, partying, or fighting.
AID00124129	If you're looking for a good time, I'd suggest hitting up Gomorrah. The girls there are pretty nice, if you know what I mean.
AID00124130	Tell me about Private Erwin.
AID00124131	Private Erwin... he's starting to get a thick file here with all his troublemaking.
AID00124132	My troopers are my business. Stay out of it.
AID00124133	What can you tell me about the Ambassador?
AID00124134	Crocker isn't too bad. He mostly stays in his office now. If you have any questions about the Embassy you should ask him. He'll talk your ear off.
AID00124135	If you want to know more about the Ambassador, go talk to him yourself.
AID00124136	I'd like to know more about you.
AID00124137	Not much to tell. Keeping the troopers in line and monitoring the Strip keeps me busy. It's my job and I'm going to do it well.
AID00124138	Now if that's all, I've got work to do.
AID00124139	Look, I don't know you at all and I'm not really interested in small talk. If you have something important to say, do so quickly.
AID00124140	What is happening on the Strip?
AID00124141	More of the usual. We're keeping an eye on the troopers to make sure they don't do anything stupid.
AID00124142	The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause me more trouble than he's worth.
AID00124143	None of your business. You better keep your nose clean because I'll be watching you.
AID00124144	People drink, gamble, and fight. What do you think happens on the Strip? Any other intelligent questions?
AID00124145	How the hell did a brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
AID00124146	I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
AID00124147	Some idiot decided it would be funny to put up graffiti all over the Strip. If I find out it was one of my men, they'll be locked up for a month.
AID00124148	Some fool troopers think they can lounge around on the rooftops instead of doing their job. If I catch them, they'll have KP duty for a year.
AID00124149	Some drunk girls thought it would be fun to play in the fountain in front of the Ultra-Luxe. Now I need to clean up the mess.
AID00124150	Tell me about yourself.
AID00124151	I don't have time to give my life story to everyone that passes through. Is there something I can actually help you with?
AID00124152	What can you tell me about the Embassy?
AID00124153	The Embassy offices are to your left while the barracks and living quarters are to the right.
AID00124154	If you're looking for a history lesson, I suggest you talk to Ambassador Crocker.
AID00124155	I'm looking for the Ambassador.
AID00124156	Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right at the end of the hall.
AID00124157	What a prize you are. Not interested.
AID00124158	You fell for this trap hook, line, and sinker. <Attack Benny.>
AID00124159	You tramp! Like I needed another social disease anyhow!
AID00124160	Keep your pants on. I've got questions that need answers.
AID00124161	The time for talk has passed, honey baby. These mouths of ours have appointments to be elsewhere.
AID00124162	Let's see what's under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny>
AID00124163	Let's see what you've been hiding under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny.>
AID00124164	More than you ever dreamed, baby.
AID00124165	You're right. I want answers.
AID00124166	Player uses SPEECH to convince Benny to accompany him immediately.
AID00124167	[SUCCEEDED] If that's what it takes to win your trust, that's what it takes. Follow me.
AID00124168	Two conditions - lose the bodyguards, and we both go to the suite now.
AID00124169	[FAILED] You tracked me across the desert, Sugar Plum. Finding the Presidential? Easy pickings.
AID00124170	Why don't you, you know... help me find where the suite is?
AID00124171	Tell Benny you're going to kill him.
AID00124172	Starts combat.
AID00124173	Decline Benny's offer and say you'll expose him.
AID00124174	Use Barter to get Benny to advance you a stack of casino chips.
AID00124175	[SUCCEEDED] Where's my manners? Here's some cash up front. There'll be more where that came from.
AID00124176	Wait for me in the Presidential suite. We got a future together, you and me. It's time we got started.
AID00124177	The suite's a nice touch, but someone's got to pay off my contract.
AID00124178	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Johnny-come-lately.
AID00124179	If you want me to play nice, it'll cost you.
AID00124180	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Janey-come-lately.
AID00124181	If you want me to play nice, it'll cost you.
AID00124182	There's a first-class offer on the table. The rest is up to you.
AID00124183	Fine, but don't keep me waiting.
AID00124184	Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
AID00124185	And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
AID00124186	Here's this key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
AID00124187	What'd you have in mind?
AID00124188	To start, I'll comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. You deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
AID00124189	I'll hang out down here for a while to make everything look business-as-usual, then come to you. Any questions you got, I'll answer - guaranteed.
AID00124190	What are you offering?
AID00124191	Ask Benny about himself and his situation.
AID00124192	Goodbye.
AID00124193	Please return when you have sufficient caps or a passport.
AID00124194	VFSLadyJaneHello
AID00124195	Excuse me, but a lady of my stature does not converse with those of low stock.
AID00124196	VFSSantiagoHello
AID00124197	Hello, my friend.
AID00124198	VFSGrecksHello
AID00124199	Those rat-bastard Garrets stopped offering tabs.  Now where the hell am I supposed to go for free drinks?
AID00124200	VFSHighTimesDealerHello
AID00124201	Friggin' troll NCR squatters.  A bunch of mouth-breathing wastes of space, if you ask me.
AID00124202	VFSBillRonteHello
AID00124203	Hey! Got any liquor on you?! I'm damn thirsty.
AID00124204	Hey. Thanks for helping me out. Being back and working really saved my life.
AID00124205	VFSJacobHoffHello
AID00124206	Got any chems, sir?  I need a hit quick!
AID00124207	Can't talk. Much work to do at the Fort and Atomic Wrangler.
AID00124208	I led you on, and it worked like a charm. Bye bye.
AID00124209	Player says goodbye.
AID00124210	Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
AID00124211	In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
AID00124212	You're stinking up my suite, Benny. Scram. We'll talk later.
AID00124213	Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
AID00124214	Here, take some chips and see how you do at the tables. Ta-ta.
AID00124215	See ya around.
AID00124216	In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
AID00124217	Goodbye.
AID00124218	All I want is to see you dead. <Attack Benny.>
AID00124219	Then this is endsville, baby - may the best man win.
AID00124220	VFSElizabethKieranHandsOutSupplies
AID00124221	Here you go. I hope this helps.
AID00124222	
AID00124223	[SUCCEEDED] You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, it's all I got.
AID00124224	Now get in there and waste those guys!
AID00124225	What's my help worth to you?
AID00124226	[FAILED] What the hell? I ain't got that kind of money!
AID00124227	Take those guys out and I'm sure the King will reward you just fine.
AID00124228	I'll need at least two thousand caps to motivate me.
AID00124229	What do you want me to do?
AID00124230	Take these assholes out, what else? Now go!
AID00124231	What about you?
AID00124232	They seem to have it in for me. Go figure. While they waste all their bullets trying to get me, you head in and waste 'em.
AID00124233	VFSKingSendsPlayerAfterPacer
AID00124234	I want you to back him up. See this through, and there'll be something good waiting for you when you get back.
AID00124235	<Securitron Dialog>
AID00124236	Howdy, pardner! You've come a far piece, haven't you? Welcome to New Vegas!
AID00124237	I'd like to ask about something else instead.
AID00124238	Oh yes, sure sure. Ask away.
AID00124239	Interesting, go on.
AID00124240	I was elected to this post seven years ago. I'm the third NCR representative to serve here in Vegas.
AID00124241	Now, I've had my share of ups and downs along the way, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
AID00124242	That's it. Anything else you wished to know?
AID00124243	Go on.
AID00124244	Now we mostly just keep track of the NCR citizens and troopers around and make sure they don't get in trouble, but that's Captain Pappas' job.
AID00124245	I keep myself busy with paperwork and reports that get sent back to the NCR. It's mostly busy work, but every once in awhile, we make progress.
AID00124246	That's enough history for me.
AID00124247	Oh... very well then. What else can I do for you?
AID00124248	Have you seen Benny?
AID00124249	I saw him heading for his suite just a few minutes ago. Looked like a fox that just got caught in the henhouse. Maybe you'll catch him there.
AID00124250	It was a while ago! He came through in a real hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
AID00124251	When's the last time you saw Benny?
AID00124252	Dig it, baby, he beat feet to his suite. You scare the big boss man or something?
AID00124253	Sure! He came through here in a big hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out there in the hall!
AID00124254	He was around not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
AID00124255	You can wait for him here, if you like. I'm incapable of asking you to leave.
AID00124256	Do you still need more vault stuff?
AID00124257	If you could bring me vault suits, I would so make it worth your while... I mean, really! But it has to be good leather, okay!?
AID00124258	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
AID00124259	Don't say anything then - you look good enough just nodding your head.
AID00124260	[FAILED] Oh, don't floor it... There's a lot more to this than a classy chassis, you know?
AID00124261	Anyway, what do you say about my proposal?
AID00124262	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
AID00124263	All right. Consider it done.
AID00124264	Thank you so much!
AID00124265	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
AID00124266	All right. Consider it done.
AID00124267	Thank you so much!
AID00124268	You are an angel. I can't wait to see you again!
AID00124269	Thinking about you in tight leather makes me want to uh... blow my top?
AID00124270	[FAILED] Oh yeah? I bet you spend most of the time thinking lines rather than putting them to use. That vault merchandise is not on your menu! Next!
AID00124271	Actually, let me ask you about something else.
AID00124272	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00124273	Quit yapping. I am starting to think of very unpleasant uses for those toasters.
AID00124274	Cool it, smarty-pants! I don't have to take that shit from anybody, you know? Get out! Don't come back until you learn how to get along.
AID00124275	Wait a moment - I changed my mind. Let me ask you something else.
AID00124276	You know, leather is my specialty. Unzip it, heat it and rub a shine onto it.
AID00124277	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Well... Ha! I don't even know what to say to that!
AID00124278	Yeah. I wanted to ask you about something else before my top blows... off, too.
AID00124279	I might be persuaded to lend a hand.
AID00124280	You would? You really would?
AID00124281	That would help me, a lot!
AID00124282	I'll pay you good money per each suit.
AID00124283	I'll help you out.
AID00124284	You would? You really would?
AID00124285	That would help me, a lot!
AID00124286	Sarah, stop right there. Do you actually have any vault gear?
AID00124287	Okay, I do, but who wants a lame sensor module, or a nitrogen canister, anyway?
AID00124288	All the popular stuff has been sold - especially the vault suits. I need to find more because people buy them like hot cakes.
AID00124289	Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
AID00124290	Vault gear - swell. Can you show me what you got?
AID00124291	Oh, yeah, sure!
AID00124292	Okay - I got these great lunchboxes, they are super! What else? Oh! Look at these toasters! You like toasts, right? If they are crunchy even better!
AID00124293	What about a vintage Vault-Tec toy car? Or-
AID00124294	I have some questions to ask first...
AID00124295	Here you go. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00124296	This doesn't interest me. I should be leaving.
AID00124297	Too late, Mortimer. You already said too much.
AID00124298	You're all hypocrites! How can you claim to be connoisseurs yet deny yourselves the greatest of all meats?
AID00124299	I am ashamed to have once called everyone here family. This isn't over, though.
AID00124300	I'll begin anew. The White Glove Society will never achieve the greatness of my new order.
AID00124301	You'll all hear from me again.
AID00124302	[Attack] You all heard his confession! The punishment for cannibalism is death!
AID00124303	So be it. But we are all cannibals here. My death will be a constant reminder, and some day you will all remember.
AID00124304	Sorry, Mortimer. Secret recipe. It isn't human, though, I can tell you that.
AID00124305	No! These are lies! I never kidnapped anyone. And even if I did, there's no harm done. He's alive, after all.
AID00124306	I'm looking for the Gourmand. Am I in the right place?
AID00124307	Get them!
AID00124308	Get him!
AID00124309	Get her!
AID00124310	<Loudly> Bad news, Mortimer. No one's eating the boy you kidnapped tonight.
AID00124311	Kidnapped? That's ridiculous! And who said anything about eating anyone?
AID00124312	I know I didn't, because I hadn't gotten to that line of my speech yet. What remarkable timing you have.
AID00124313	What are you- ? Why is he there? Who are we eating right now?
AID00124314	Yeah, I heard that before. What about actual vault gear?
AID00124315	Okay, I do, but who wants a lame sensor module, or a nitrogen canister, anyway?
AID00124316	All the popular stuff has been sold - especially the vault suits. I need to find more because people buy them like hot cakes.
AID00124317	Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
AID00124318	VMS18PhilippeTrapped
AID00124319	What the- ? You son of a- ! Goddamn motherf- ! Ugh! Let me out!
AID00124320	VMS18PhilippeDetectTed
AID00124321	You get back here with our dinner!
AID00124322	I'm just browsing.
AID00124323	Please let me know if anything catches your eye.
AID00124324	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
AID00124325	Of course.
AID00124326	VFSOrrisMistaken
AID00124327	Hmmm, I guess they were harmless after all. I'm not often mistaken, you know.
AID00124328	VFSOrrisLeaves
AID00124329	Just so you know, heading out here breaks our contract. This is why I ask people to pay up front. See you around.
AID00124330	You don't follow orders very well, do you? Oh well, more money for me.
AID00124331	VFSOrrisChats03
AID00124332	Down to the right here is the fun part of town. You haven't seen Freeside till you've been to the Wrangler.
AID00124333	VFSOrrisChats02
AID00124334	Up ahead on the next block is where the Kings hang out. Don't let them scare you, if they don't outnumber you five to one you'll be fine.
AID00124335	VFSOrrisChats01
AID00124336	To your left here is the Old Mormon Fort. You get roughed up, the Followers there will patch you right up. Not that I ever need their services.
AID00124337	Two hundred caps! That's twice what everyone else is charging!
AID00124338	Hey, you want the best, you have to pay for it.
AID00124339	I'm a little busy right now.
AID00124340	I beg your pardon, then. I'll let you get about your business.
AID00124341	Sure.
AID00124342	I'm listening.
AID00124343	Will it be dangerous? I like dangerous.
AID00124344	In that case, some of the things I need handled will be right up your alley.
AID00124345	Would you be willing to sponsor me as an honorary member now?
AID00124346	The answer is still no, I fear. You need to be the talk of the town, really. Think big! Your name should be on everyone's lips.
AID00124347	Come back then, and we shall welcome you with open arms.
AID00124348	Most definitely! You have become quite an impressive person in my estimation, and you are very well regarded here among those in the know.
AID00124349	You have my full support, and you are welcome to join us at our nightly banquets in our special section of the Gourmand.
AID00124350	I hope to see you there.
AID00124351	I want to join the White Glove Society. I was told I'd need a sponsor.
AID00124352	Why yes, of course. The White Glove Society is the most exclusive club in all of New Vegas. Perhaps the entire world.
AID00124353	It's only natural that you'd need a sponsor from within the club who can vouch for your good name.
AID00124354	Originally we didn't allow anyone else in, you see. Founding members only. We thought exclusivity would make us the envy of everyone who's anyone.
AID00124355	And it has. But then I had the idea to allow honorary members. Lower in status, naturally, but it just makes people want to be us even more.
AID00124356	And the right people could certainly do wonders for our image. Celebrities, philanthropists. We want only the very best.
AID00124357	I'm afraid you are a relative unknown. Certainly not the caliber of person we would consider for such an honor. Not yet, anyway.
AID00124358	If you had more notoriety or clout here on the Strip, things would be different. People need to have heard of you, and you must be well thought of.
AID00124359	And you most definitely fit the bill. Given your deeds on the Strip alone, I can safely say that you would be a prized addition to our honorary ranks.
AID00124360	Mmm. You'll have to look elsewhere, I'm afraid. The whole idea of "joining" the White Glove Society is pure hogwash.
AID00124361	You're either in it, or you're not. There's no joining.
AID00124362	This "honorary member" nonsense is just something Marjorie contrived because she's so preoccupied with image. But it's only a fad.
AID00124363	Once it blows over the riff-raff we've temporarily inducted will be shown the door. So I wouldn't hold out hope if I were you.
AID00124364	What did you say about not being the owner of the hotel and shop?
AID00124365	I take care of it but I suppose you could say that it belongs to Mr. House.
AID00124366	I would like to know other things about you and this hotel.
AID00124367	I see. Okay, your move.
AID00124368	I have some more questions about Vault 21
AID00124369	I still have some questions about Vault 21.
AID00124370	All right! What would you like to know?
AID00124371	Count on it.
AID00124372	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
AID00124373	Just don't say "Here, now!" Don't want to get the patrons all riled up, do we?
AID00124374	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha ha! Okay - why don't you help me out and in the meantime I will think about where to... take advantage of your skills.
AID00124375	I had other questions for you.
AID00124376	Do you miss the old days in the vault?
AID00124377	It was bustling with activity! We all knew each other so well - you see, the vault kept us all even. It's all symmetry and windows down there.
AID00124378	We solved any quarrels through gambling! Lady luck casts no eyeballs, you know? So, nobody shafted anyone else!
AID00124379	Yeah... I miss those days!
AID00124380	Yeah... I miss those days!
AID00124381	Do you get a lot of business here?
AID00124382	Sure! The place's packed... usually.
AID00124383	We get loads of NCR cubes these days, a stray Brahmin baron once in a while, and recently circled couples shining big rocks on their fingers.
AID00124384	Why did he fill the vault with concrete?
AID00124385	I don't know! Maybe he didn't want anybody sneaking around down there.
AID00124386	My vault runs deep and wide! It's filled with corridors and rooms that go far.
AID00124387	What gives him the right to screw us with the royal shaft, anyway? So, he saved New Vegas. Wohooo! Now scram and let us go on with our lives! Sheesh!
AID00124388	Sure. I would like that.
AID00124389	Righty-o, daddy-o. Let's do it!
AID00124390	You run the place, then?
AID00124391	Yeah - and you got to dig what I did with it! Looking as good as it should... almost.
AID00124392	What does Mr. House have to do with Vault 21?
AID00124393	Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
AID00124394	I almost went ape! So, we convinced him - okay, Sheldon and I, right? We convinced him to leave the top level mostly intact!
AID00124395	Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
AID00124396	Something doesn't add up, Sarah. This can't be all that.
AID00124397	[FAILED] I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
AID00124398	Sheldon also likes the indoors... a lot. Are you agoraphobic too?
AID00124399	Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
AID00124400	Sarah - there is something else behind all this, right?
AID00124401	[SUCCEEDED] Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
AID00124402	You have never actually left this place?
AID00124403	Sure I have! I made the scene in The Strip. It is just that I really like it here - Vault 21 is a kick!
AID00124404	What is so special about this vault?
AID00124405	My vault is pure New Vegas. Everyone has a chance and lady luck smiles if you play your odds right!... Okay, it was like that before we had to leave.
AID00124406	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
AID00124407	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
AID00124408	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
AID00124409	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
AID00124410	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
AID00124411	BCPrivateKowalskiAttack
AID00124412	Oh, that's it. Your ass is mine!
AID00124413	Yeah, whatever.
AID00124414	Just get the fuck away from here, already.
AID00124415	Where are you normally stationed?
AID00124416	Camp McCarran, but I'm on leave at the moment - heading back to California to see my folks.
AID00124417	I'm supposed to join up with a caravan that's heading that way up at the 188, but they're not due to arrive for awhile yet.
AID00124418	< Speech Option - 30 >
AID00124419	[SUCCEEDED] All right, apology accepted. Don't let it happen again.
AID00124420	My apologies. It was rude and disrespectful of me to do that.
AID00124421	[FAILED] Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm done with you.
AID00124422	Sorry. I, uh, didn't know what I was doing.
AID00124423	I'm sorry to hear that.
AID00124424	Don't worry about it.
AID00124425	What is this memorial?
AID00124426	It commemorates the Battle of Hoover Dam. The rangers lured the best of Caesar's Legion into Boulder City, then blew the whole town up.
AID00124427	The NCR still lost a bunch of troops in the fighting, though. My older brother sacrificed himself so they could evacuate some of the wounded.
AID00124428	Goodbye.
AID00124429	Bye.
AID00124430	You're a little bitch and your brother was, too.
AID00124431	Oh, now it's on.
AID00124432	I didn't come here to negotiate, I came for revenge. <Attack Benny.>
AID00124433	We talk here and now, or I tell everyone my story.
AID00124434	Do what you got to do, baby, and let the chips fall as they may. You know where to find me.
AID00124435	Tell Benny you're going to kill him.
AID00124436	What is Thermite?
AID00124437	Thermite is a mix of rust and aluminum dust. If you add a little heat, a massive amount of heat is spit out.
AID00124438	It gives off enough heat to melt through just about anything. It should make short work of the weapons.
AID00124439	
AID00124440	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, fuck you.
AID00124441	Alright, I'll place the fucking Thermite myself. You get out of the casino for a bit. I'll take care of it while you're gone.
AID00124442	If you don't deploy the Thermite yourself, I'll tell the bosses what you've been planning.
AID00124443	[FAILED] Nothing you could threaten me with holds a candle to what the Omertas would do to me if they caught me.
AID00124444	You deploy the Thermite or I'll punch you in the shoulder.
AID00124445	Give me the Thermite and I'll destroy the weapons.
AID00124446	Okay, here's the Thermite and a key to the room where the guns are stored. Place the Thermite on the crates in the room.
AID00124447	I rigged the light switch outside the room to kick off a spark big enough to hold the Thermite. That should turn that shit into molten slag.
AID00124448	As soon as we're done talking I'm going to make myself like a ghost. I don't want to be anywhere near here when the bosses find out.
AID00124449	Where do the guns come from?
AID00124450	I've made lots of contacts over the years. I have some friends back in California that can get their hands on just about anything.
AID00124451	Mostly I've been calling in every last favor I have.
AID00124452	That's it for now.
AID00124453	Okay, cool.
AID00124454	Let's talk about something else.
AID00124455	Alright, let's.
AID00124456	I have a couple more questions about the guns.
AID00124457	Okay, try and be fast about it.
AID00124458	What can we do to take care of the guns?
AID00124459	As a little pet project I've been making some thermite. Thermite burns as hot as the devil's asshole and can melt through just about anything.
AID00124460	I've been keeping it so if the Family betrays me I can hopefully do some damage before I end up dead or in jail.
AID00124461	Okay, I know the stuff inside and out. What do you want to know?
AID00124462	I have some more questions about the Thermite.
AID00124463	How do you get the guns into the strip?
AID00124464	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
AID00124465	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
AID00124466	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
AID00124467	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
AID00124468	I found proof of your blackmail.
AID00124469	Well that motherfucker. What the hell. Damn, thanks for finding this.
AID00124470	This should be plenty of proof to cover my ass if they try to rat me out to any authorities.
AID00124471	What would you like to know?
AID00124472	And this is where I come in.
AID00124473	Right. We just want to find out what sort of technology Mr. House has used to stay alive for all these years.
AID00124474	It could be of great benefit to the people we try to help, many of whom suffer from hard to diagnose illnesses.
AID00124475	Yes.
AID00124476	Oh. Great! The Followers of the Apocalypse, well some of us, anyway, have been interested in Mr. House's technology, how he stays alive.
AID00124477	Of course, no one is allowed inside the Lucky 38, so no one knows what's going on. Well, except for you.
AID00124478	Why do you want to know?
AID00124479	Oh! Well, I heard... I mean, we heard... we meaning the Followers of the Apocalypse... that you had been in there. The Lucky 38, I mean.
AID00124480	And we were wondering if you could help us. If it's not too much trouble, of course.
AID00124481	Who are you?
AID00124482	I'm Jane, one of Mr. House's girls. We keep him... entertained. We don't get many guests lately; perhaps we can entertain you as well.
AID00124483	VVault21TourTopic008
AID00124484	Down there is the game room! Each side of the vault had one... but the other is filled with concrete now. Okay, that wraps it up. I'll see you soon!
AID00124485	VVault21TourTopic007
AID00124486	This hall leads to our guest rooms. You can use the first room on our left. But no snooping next door! That's my room, always was.
AID00124487	VVault21TourTopic006
AID00124488	We used to have such parties in this diner! A bitch to clean later... but well worth it!
AID00124489	VVault21TourTopic005
AID00124490	Chosen representatives gambled against each other here. The winner earned the right to settle the dispute as wished by the collective.
AID00124491	VVault21TourTopic004
AID00124492	This is the main game-hall. Here we settled the big disputes among the vault's levels.
AID00124493	VVault21TourTopic003
AID00124494	Don't get lost! My vault has many corridors and rooms - although it is no longer symmetrical, after Mr. House threw us out.
AID00124495	VVault21TourTopic002
AID00124496	Above us there's the control center for this level of the vault's life-support systems, electric grid, radioactive shields and all that jazz.
AID00124497	VVault21TourTopic001
AID00124498	This bunker protects the entrance to the vault - solid stone outside and thick steel on the inside!
AID00124499	VVault21TourTopic000
AID00124500	All right! Please, follow me. We'll head into the vault right away.
AID00124501	
AID00124502	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you've done some good work for us. I'll do this as a favor for you.
AID00124503	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
AID00124504	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm sure they enjoy the cash flow, but that doesn't mean dick to me.
AID00124505	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
AID00124506	[SUCCEEDED] We don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Alright, we'll give them a little bit of extra business.
AID00124507	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
AID00124508	[FAILED] They're small timers, I could give a fuck what they would enjoy.
AID00124509	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
AID00124510	Sorry, but I don't know you from Adam, and you don't have any business getting in our business.
AID00124511	Mick and Ralph are curious why you stopped buying guns from them.
AID00124512	He seems pretty tired.
AID00124513	I bet he does. That's from hookers and chems. His work for us is the most restful part of his day.
AID00124514	
AID00124515	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I see where you're coming from. Okay, tell Troike he can hit the road.
AID00124516	Troike is pretty strung out. He'll be more trouble than he is worth.
AID00124517	[FAILED] Nah, I don't think so. We've still got some work for him to do.
AID00124518	Well I'm sure he's be a very productive worker, he could use some vacation time.
AID00124519	
AID00124520	[SUCCEEDED] Really? That was his idea? Alright, he can go. Hopefully he finds us some good deals out there.
AID00124521	<Lie>Troike wants to see about negotiation some lower prices for weapons for you guys.
AID00124522	[FAILED] You're really funny. I like you. But no. We still have business for Troike.
AID00124523	Um... I'm sure you have enough guns.
AID00124524	Big Sal agreed to let you go.
AID00124525	Holy shit, really? Okay, I'll help you, but I'm getting the hell out of here first chance I get.
AID00124526	Why do they need to die?
AID00124527	As long as they're alive, they can start up their plans again. All you've managed to do is stall them. I guarantee you they have contingencies.
AID00124528	What's the next step in breaking up the bosses plans?
AID00124529	Now we cut off the head of the serpent. Big Sal and Nero have to die.
AID00124530	What's the next step in breaking up the bosses plans?
AID00124531	
AID00124532	You better get outside for a little bit. I'm sure they are going to look for the infamous courier when things go to hell.
AID00124533	Troike is on his way to destroy the guns for me.
AID00124534	Yeah, poor fucker got himself caught after he melted all the guns. Bastard mentioned your name before they shot him in the head.
AID00124535	Now the bosses want to see you.
AID00124536	Troike destroyed the guns for me.
AID00124537	Whoa, you managed to pull that off? Solid work. That ought to gum up the bosses' plans.
AID00124538	I destroyed all the guns.
AID00124539	Well, what the fuck are you talking to me for? Go destroy the damn guns so we can move on.
AID00124540	Troike gave me some Thermite to destroy the guns.
AID00124541	Yeah, we saw the troopers come through. I can't imagine things are going to work out well for him.
AID00124542	Clanden has been arrested.
AID00124543	Oh, is that right? Well I guess if he's gone, he's gone. I don't need to know anything more than that.
AID00124544	Clanden is leaving Gomorrah and won't be back.
AID00124545	Oh, is that right? Was that your handiwork? Well I can't say I'm sad to see him go, he gave me the fucking creeps.
AID00124546	Clanden is dead.
AID00124547	Could you repair some things for me?
AID00124548	Sure, let's see what you've got.
AID00124549	I'd like to talk about something else.
AID00124550	What do you want to talk about?
AID00124551	What can you tell me about your organization?
AID00124552	My, such a popular question. I suppose it is only natural to see us and wonder what it is that makes us special.
AID00124553	The White Glove Society has only just made itself known to the public, of course, but our pedigree was established over generations.
AID00124554	Were we always so refined? I'd be lying if I said yes. But I've always felt we were destined for a place atop modern society. And now, here we are.
AID00124555	Not everyone can wear the finest clothes and eat the finest foods, obviously. That's just the reality we live in.
AID00124556	But surely we can agree that the most tasteful, sophisticated people are the most deserving. That's what the White Glove Society is all about.
AID00124557	What happened to Boulder City?
AID00124558	Destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam a couple of years ago. The town was set up as a trap for Caesar's Legion.
AID00124559	The sharpshooters in the Rangers picked off the Legion's veterans from a distance, and the rest of the Legion just rushed on in. Then - boom!
AID00124560	The President is coming to Hoover Dam?
AID00124561	It's probably just a political thing - you know, give a few speeches, shake hands with the troops, boost morale.
AID00124562	Where can I find McCarran?
AID00124563	Camp McCarran is the headquarters for the NCR military in this region. It occupies the old airport next to New Vegas.
AID00124564	Is there anything you can tell me about the Great Khans?
AID00124565	They're an outlaw group, primarily trafficking in drugs and other contraband. They usually stay out of NCR territory, though.
AID00124566	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
AID00124567	It's one of the biggest sources of electrical power in the region, so the NCR's fortified the place pretty heavily.
AID00124568	When President Kimball shows up on his inspection tour, I'm sure he'll be confident that the Dam is safe and secure.
AID00124569	Let's talk about something else.
AID00124570	All right.
AID00124571	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00124572	Go ahead.
AID00124573	Where did you say the investigator's room was, again?
AID00124574	If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
AID00124575	DealerBlackWidow
AID00124576	VFSHighTimesDealerDone
AID00124577	Get lost.
AID00124578	<Speech>
AID00124579	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, Julie... I've really screwed things up.
AID00124580	I'll head over to the fort and get some rest. This has gone on too long.
AID00124581	Bill, Julie and the rest of your friends miss you. They need your help.
AID00124582	[FAILED] Sissy?! Real men can hold their liquor, and I'm double-clutching mine!
AID00124583	Harden the hell up, Bill. You're being a sissy!
AID00124584	<Science>
AID00124585	[SUCCEEDED] Never thought about using that combination before. Should be able to get through this with that.
AID00124586	A combination of Fixer, Psycho, and Buffout would do it in one shot.
AID00124587	[FAILED] No way, the withdrawal symptoms will kill me if I don't have Fixer to flush out the chems.
AID00124588	Fixer is for pansies!
AID00124589	<Science>
AID00124590	[SUCCEEDED] Man, you're one hell of an egghead. If you think it'll work, I'll give it a shot.
AID00124591	Regulating decreasing doses of booze with a couple shots of Fixer should do it.
AID00124592	[FAILED] Oh, I'll be vomiting plenty if you don't get me Fixer. You're worse than that damn dealer.
AID00124593	Just stick your fingers down your throat. That'll flush you real good.
AID00124594	<Lie> Yes, everything's resolved - Hanlon and I found a Legion spy at Camp Golf.
AID00124595	I knew it. I'm glad you and the Chief were able to put a stop to this.
AID00124596	Hanlon was the one sending out the false reports. He killed himself rather than turning himself in.
AID00124597	What? Chief Hanlon. The man's a war hero? Why would he...? That just doesn't make sense. This is awful...
AID00124598	VMS21BigSalGreeting
AID00124599	So I assume you know why we called you here?
AID00124600	Is this you asking for a last request?
AID00124601	VMS21OfficeBark
AID00124602	Let's have some words. Take a seat on the couch so we can get to talking.
AID00124603	Please, have a seat. Let's have a bit of a pow-wow.
AID00124604	VMS21CachinoGun
AID00124605	Hey, here is that gun I promised you. I suggest using it while they are talking, I'm pretty sure they're going to kill you after they've talked.
AID00124606	Hey, I'll take care of them when you're ready, just say the word. I suggest doing it while they're talking to get the drop on them.
AID00124607	I'm not ready to take out the bosses yet.
AID00124608	Hurry and get ready. I'll give you a gun when you get to the room.
AID00124609	Hurry and get ready. I'll be waiting for you there when you're ready.
AID00124610	Let's go take care of the bosses.
AID00124611	Hurry and get ready. I'll give you a gun when you get to the room.
AID00124612	Hurry and get ready. I'll be waiting for you there when you're ready.
AID00124613	
AID00124614	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll take care of them. Just give me the word when to start shooting.
AID00124615	They are going to expect something from me, you can do it and surprise them.
AID00124616	[FAILED] If you aren't a good shot then we're fucked anyways. No, I think you're going to have to do it.
AID00124617	I'm not a very good shot, you should kill them.
AID00124618	What happens when the bosses are gone?
AID00124619	When they're gone I'm gonna run this joint. Don't worry, I'll take care of the place.
AID00124620	How do we take care of the bosses?
AID00124621	They're a little bit upset about what's been done to muck up their plans. They tasked me to find out who's responsible.
AID00124622	There isn't going to be another chance to get both of them together in the same room. I'll slip you a gun and we can take them out.
AID00124623	I have some questions about the Bosses plans.
AID00124624	Alright, let's have them.
AID00124625	VMS18PatrollerDetectTed
AID00124626	He's trying to escape!
AID00124627	You're not getting away!
AID00124628	Cachino! Shoot now.
AID00124629	Cachino? What the fu...
AID00124630	Time to die, Sal.
AID00124631	Alright, let's dance.
AID00124632	I hear you lost some guns.
AID00124633	Yeah, we lost some guns you little weasel. However, we can get more guns. You slowed us down but you can't stop us.
AID00124634	You're gonna die a failure.
AID00124635	No idea.
AID00124636	Well you've been a real thorn in our side. We've got business plans. You set us back a little bit, I'll admit that.
AID00124637	However, we wanted you to know that nothing you did made a shit bit of difference, and you're going to die a failure.
AID00124638	
AID00124639	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like a deal to me.
AID00124640	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
AID00124641	[FAILED] Yeah, but come back when you have the money.
AID00124642	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
AID00124643	[FAILED] I bet it does, but free ain't gonna work.
AID00124644	Free sounds better to me.
AID00124645	Ok, 300 caps is a deal.
AID00124646	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks you ain't never seen me before.
AID00124647	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks you ain't never seen me before.
AID00124648	Thanks, but I'll find another way.
AID00124649	No skin off my back.
AID00124650	I need a key to Cachino's room. Do you have one that will work?
AID00124651	Yeah, Cachino is a creep. I'll give you a key for some caps... Hazard pay.
AID00124652	Yeah, Cachino is a creep. I'll give you a key for some caps... Hazard pay.
AID00124653	I need more film for the camera
AID00124654	Here.
AID00124655	Okay. You got it.
AID00124656	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
AID00124657	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
AID00124658	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
AID00124659	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
AID00124660	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
AID00124661	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
AID00124662	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
AID00124663	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
AID00124664	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
AID00124665	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
AID00124666	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
AID00124667	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
AID00124668	Answers first, then I decide.
AID00124669	Let's talk about something else.
AID00124670	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
AID00124671	Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this and "my pleasure" that.
AID00124672	Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
AID00124673	What do you think of the Omertas?
AID00124674	A tribe of finks. Every single one of them is a degenerate.
AID00124675	Mark my words - they're playing an angle. How do I know? They always are.
AID00124676	I dug myself out of that grave to put you in yours, Benny.
AID00124677	Uh oh.
AID00124678	What makes you think you can succeed?
AID00124679	Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are.
AID00124680	I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got more to learn, but it's... it's coming together.
AID00124681	No deal. Time for you to die. <Attack Benny>
AID00124682	We gotta problem, boys!
AID00124683	Forget it, I forgive you.
AID00124684	You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
AID00124685	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. The least I can do is comp you the Presidential for as long as you want it.
AID00124686	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby - all the way.
AID00124687	You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
AID00124688	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. Here, take the key to the Presidential - the best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like.
AID00124689	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby. Catch you later.
AID00124690	Like I'd trust you? No thanks.
AID00124691	I know, you figure me for a creep. It's your prerogative.
AID00124692	If you change your mind, come find me on the casino floor. In the meantime, the Presidential is yours whenever you want it. Adios.
AID00124693	I know, you figure me for a creep. And you done me a solid already, just by not shooting at me.
AID00124694	As a token of appreciation, this here's the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like, free of charge.
AID00124695	If you change your mind, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll work out the next step of this caper. Adios.
AID00124696	It's a deal.
AID00124697	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
AID00124698	Here's a start on your retainer - don't spend it all in one place. And the Prez is yours for as long as you want it.
AID00124699	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
AID00124700	Ring-a-ding, baby! Ta-ta!
AID00124701	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
AID00124702	Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
AID00124703	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
AID00124704	Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
AID00124705	No deal. Time to die.
AID00124706	Guess I shoulda seen that coming.
AID00124707	What are you offering?
AID00124708	You help me, and before long the Chairmen will rule all of Vegas, dig? With enough robot muscle to back it up.
AID00124709	You'll get a sweet, juicy cut of that action. But until that day comes, I'll keep you on retainer, and pay bonuses for "special missions."
AID00124710	How's that sound?
AID00124711	What does the Chip do?
AID00124712	It has something to do with the Securitrons, I know that much. Upgrades their hitting power, gives them heft.
AID00124713	Might be slightly useful, if you're looking to defend the Strip from Caesar's Legion or the NCR. Or maybe both?
AID00124714	What are you offering?
AID00124715	Help me understand this scheme of yours.
AID00124716	I want to know about the factions gunning for Vegas.
AID00124717	Let's talk about the Platinum Chip.
AID00124718	
AID00124719	Look at me, a big-leaguer or so I claim, making all the mistakes of an original loser...
AID00124720	You left quite a trail. <Show Benny his cigarette butt and lighter.>
AID00124721	Looks like I should think about quitting...
AID00124722	You left these at my grave.<Show Benny his cigarette butts.>
AID00124723	To think I deemed that flintbox my lucky charm. Oh, the irony...
AID00124724	Seems you dropped something in Boulder City. <Show Benny his lighter.>
AID00124725	The hows don't matter.
AID00124726	A magician don't explain his tricks. I get it.
AID00124727	Tell me why you used Great Khans.
AID00124728	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
AID00124729	Worst of the worst! A tribe of degenerate losers led by a creep. They crucify people for kicks! Slaughter whole towns!
AID00124730	The NCR beat them at the dam three years ago, but that didn't stop them. They've spent the meanwhile gathering strength.
AID00124731	They're gonna try to take the dam again, real soon. And if they do, Vegas as we know it will cease to exist.
AID00124732	Fill me in about the NCR.
AID00124733	A nation of meddlers, trying to muscle in on our action. Well, we got muscles too, and smarts besides.
AID00124734	Only reason the NCR hasn't busted up our scene is they're a little afraid of Mr. House, and a lot afraid of Caesar.
AID00124735	If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them - not yet.
AID00124736	Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are out best customers. It's complicated.
AID00124737	What makes the Chairmen so special?
AID00124738	We're the definition of cool, baby. We know how to swing. Folks come to us to learn how to enjoy themselves.
AID00124739	Of the three families, we're the only ones with the heart and savoir-faire to run the Strip on our own.
AID00124740	Tell me about Mr. House.
AID00124741	A good cat to swing with. Or was - until he stopped mewing.
AID00124742	It was House's big idea to resurrect the Strip. He recruited the Three Families as muscle, showed us how to set up casinos, negotiated with the NCR.
AID00124743	None of this in person, mind you. Did all his talking through those Securitrons of his. But lately? The silence is deafening.
AID00124744	The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
AID00124745	If you're thinking we can work together, let's hear your offer.
AID00124746	What makes you think you can succeed?
AID00124747	What's your plan?
AID00124748	What's your offer?
AID00124749	If you're thinking we can work together, let's hear your offer.
AID00124750	The ruthlessness of others is no excuse.
AID00124751	Was a time I would've agreed with you. But this... it's too big, it affects too many people. I can't get hung up on those details.
AID00124752	I see your point.
AID00124753	It's a game, and games have winners and losers. I prefer the former, how about you?
AID00124754	You're right, murder is the answer. Yours. <Attack Benny.>
AID00124755	Not the point I was aiming for but, well, let's see this through.
AID00124756	And you're willing to commit murder to make this happen?
AID00124757	Baby, do you not understand the level of game here?
AID00124758	What I did to you was rotten, but if you think House, the NCR or Caesar won't kill to put Vegas in their pocket, I really did blow out your brains.
AID00124759	What is this scheme of yours, Benny?
AID00124760	I want to know about the factions gunning for Vegas.
AID00124761	The Chip belongs to me. Hand it over.
AID00124762	Baby, ease off the gas. The Chip belongs in the hands of someone who can use it. As in me, not you.
AID00124763	You'll get a piece of the action, and a sweet one. But the Chip sticks with me.
AID00124764	First things first. Tell me about the Platinum Chip.
AID00124765	What's the deal with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
AID00124766	You really weren't supposed to talk to him...
AID00124767	All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest, until I gave him a mickey in the shape of pulse grenade.
AID00124768	Once he was on the nod, I yanked some wires and dragged him up to the workshop. I had... some help, you see.
AID00124769	Gal named Emily, one of the Followers over in Freeside, a real whiz when it comes to things technical. She programmed his personality.
AID00124770	Once Yes Man was hooked back in to House's data network, I started learning a lot more about what he was up to, dig? Like where and when to find you.
AID00124771	I've got questions - a bunch of them.
AID00124772	How's the Chip work?
AID00124773	It's some kind of data storage device, dig? So it's the data on the Chip that's platinum, not the Chip itself.
AID00124774	Trouble is, the Chip don't fit any computer I've found. Must require special hardware.
AID00124775	What is the Platinum Chip?
AID00124776	Orris left town after I had a little talk with him.
AID00124777	Convinced him, huh? I could use more men with your powers of persuasion.
AID00124778	You've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
AID00124779	
AID00124780	[SUCCEEDED] I ought to take my chances and kill you right here, but you may be right. Here, take this.
AID00124781	Don't think this is over, though. I'll have that money back, out of your hide if I have to.
AID00124782	I want all the money you have on you. I could make it to the Kings from here.
AID00124783	[FAILED] I think I'll keep my money thanks. You take that fanciful tale of yours wherever you'd like. Now let's go. I have a job to finish.
AID00124784	You should give me all your money. Or I'll tell. And stuff.
AID00124785	After you.
AID00124786	Stay close. I wouldn't want something to happen to you.
AID00124787	Or, you just faked this whole thing to drum up repeat business.
AID00124788	That's an interesting theory you've got there. I'd suggest you keep it to yourself. Let's get moving.
AID00124789	Let's keep moving.
AID00124790	My thoughts exactly. Time is money, after all.
AID00124791	Why did you run ahead like that?
AID00124792	Call it a hunch. You do this job for long enough, and you learn to trust your instincts.
AID00124793	
AID00124794	[SUCCEEDED] Er, noticed that, did you? I keenly aimed one of the shots through some soft tissue of one of them to hit the man behind him.
AID00124795	Hey you only fired three shots and there are four guys there...
AID00124796	[FAILED] You're imagining things. It's just the rush of adrenaline caused by your near brush with death.
AID00124797	Luckily for you, I was here, so there's no reason to get out of sorts.
AID00124798	Something about this doesn't seem right...
AID00124799	I think I already killed him...
AID00124800	So it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
AID00124801	Even though you lack subtlety, you've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
AID00124802	VFSKingGreetsPlayerWithLadies
AID00124803	Ah, my little friend has come at last. Not me, darling, though you were doing just fine.
AID00124804	VFSKingTellsLadiesToLeave
AID00124805	Ladies, take five. I need to talk to my friend here.
AID00124806	VFSKingBodyguardKingsNotIn
AID00124807	I'm looking for someone.
AID00124808	Oh. Well, it's a big hotel. You should talk to Marjorie - she's in charge and she can probably help you find anyone you might need.
AID00124809	She usually works at the front of the Gourmand. She likes to see how people respond to it.
AID00124810	You can get to the Gourmand from the lobby here - it's a big set of double doors on the first floor on the eastern side. Can't miss it.
AID00124811	Where is your mask?
AID00124812	Hmm. Must've forgotten to put it on. How embarrassing.
AID00124813	Why is everyone around here dressed up and wearing masks?
AID00124814	Those are all members of the White Glove Society. Our founder, Marjorie, gave us all a dress code. There's only one rule to it.
AID00124815	In her words, we must dress in such a way that no one can be said to have dressed better than us.
AID00124816	As for the masks, I'm not allowed to tell you. We're sworn to secrecy.
AID00124817	Actually that's not true. That's just what we're supposed to say.
AID00124818	I think Marjorie likes them for the mystery they create. And the way they make it clear that we're different from everyone else.
AID00124819	But you didn't hear that from me.
AID00124820	VFSSecuritronHalt
AID00124821	You have entered a restricted area!  Exit the gate area or you will be fired upon!
AID00124822	VFSSecuritronKill
AID00124823	You have been warned! Extermination imminent!
AID00124824	Vaporization subroutine initiated!
AID00124825	Unauthorized entry detected!
AID00124826	Have a nice day!
AID00124827	Exterminate!
AID00124828	You have the wrong person.
AID00124829	I'm sorry that you think so. However, if you do happen to change your mind, you can find me here at the embassy.
AID00124830	You have my attention, go on.
AID00124831	To the northeast is a settlement, the locals here call them "Boomers." They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
AID00124832	I'd like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
AID00124833	Unfortunately, the Boomers keep to themselves and are, let's say, hostile to all outsiders. That is why I need someone like you.
AID00124834	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
AID00124835	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
AID00124836	Do you think you would be able to do this for me?
AID00124837	No thanks. I can handle myself just fine.
AID00124838	Bad idea, pardner! That man you're chasing, he's a bad penny all right - a rattlesnake of a man. Think of Mr. House as anti-venom.
AID00124839	Tell Mr. House I might stop by. We'll see.
AID00124840	Don't you dawdle, little doggie! Mr. House isn't someone you want to go about snubbing. He'll be waiting.
AID00124841	All right, I'll go there straight off.
AID00124842	Yeehaw, pardner! That's the spirit. He'll be waiting for you.
AID00124843	Why is a robot passing on his invitation?
AID00124844	Well now, it was Mr. House who made Securitrons like me. Seems the least I could do is pass on his message. Don't dawdle. He'll be waiting.
AID00124845	Not now, Victor - I'm busy.
AID00124846	Sure you are, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
AID00124847	Mr. House, the head honcho of New Vegas, is itching to make your acquaintance. He'll help you serve that cold dish of yours extra-chilly.
AID00124848	Point me to The Tops, Victor. I've got a score to settle.
AID00124849	Sorry, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
AID00124850	Mr. House, the head honcho of New Vegas, is itching to make your acquaintance. He'll help you serve that cold dish of yours extra-chilly.
AID00124851	This place looks amazing. Where do I start?
AID00124852	The place to get started is the Lucky 38. See that big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner?
AID00124853	That's where you'll find Mr. House, New Vegas's head honcho. And he's itching to make your acquaintance.
AID00124854	What are you doing here?
AID00124855	Consider me your personal welcome wagon! Now hear this - the head honcho of New Vegas, Mr. House, is itching to make your acquaintance.
AID00124856	Just head for the Lucky 38. It's the big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner.
AID00124857	Is there anyone who could do all that?
AID00124858	There's an old scientist named Dr. Henry who reportedly specializes in this sort of procedure. He'd probably be your best bet.
AID00124859	Last I heard, he was living up in Jacobstown, far to the northwest.
AID00124860	So there's no chance he'll ever get better?
AID00124861	I didn't say that. While no one here has that kind of expertise, I do know of one man who might fit the bill.
AID00124862	The King brought him here for treatment then?
AID00124863	Yes, a few months ago. We had to tell him there was nothing we could do.
AID00124864	So you can't heal him?
AID00124865	No, Rex's condition is way beyond anything we can handle. He requires brain surgery, and some sophisticated cybernetics work, too.
AID00124866	The King said you could tell me more about his robotic dog.
AID00124867	Rex? It breaks my heart every time I see him. He's such a good dog.
AID00124868	How you feeling, boy?
AID00124869	<happy bark!>
AID00124870	<whimper>
AID00124871	I'm still working on getting you fixed.
AID00124872	<bark!>
AID00124873	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris06
AID00124874	Much obliged.
AID00124875	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris05
AID00124876	Fine, then. I guess I'll hire you.
AID00124877	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris04
AID00124878	Look, the Kings clubbed him from behind and dragged him away. I don't think missing your commission is his number one concern right now.
AID00124879	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris03
AID00124880	But I always hire Orris! How do I know you're not trying to steal my business from him?
AID00124881	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris02
AID00124882	That's right. But I'm available. And I'm cheaper.
AID00124883	VFSGamblerAsksForOrris
AID00124884	So you're saying Orris isn't available?
AID00124885	Not interested. I'll see myself out.
AID00124886	You have an "interest" in this, whether you like it or not. You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip to me.
AID00124887	Now, I could stop you from leaving, but what would that accomplish? If you want to go, go.
AID00124888	See what the Strip I built - the Strip I own - has to offer. Think about what I could offer you. I expect we'll have occasion to talk again.
AID00124889	Let's get down to business, then.
AID00124890	I think I'll be leaving.
AID00124891	You are the first person to step foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. It was not an invitation I made lightly.
AID00124892	We have a serious matter to discuss, concerning a contract you have yet to fulfill.
AID00124893	I think I'll be leaving.
AID00124894	Why the VIP treatment? I'm just a courier.
AID00124895	I think I'll be on my way.
AID00124896	Shall we get down to business?
AID00124897	What are you talking about? I'm just a courier.
AID00124898	Shall we get down to business, then?
AID00124899	Shall we get down to business?
AID00124900	That doesn't sound like a good idea.
AID00124901	Yeah, I know. That's why I'm not really going to do it.
AID00124902	A prank you say?
AID00124903	Yeah, I've got a few ideas that I'm working on. Maybe I'll let you in on it once I have something.
AID00124904	I changed my mind. Let me ask you about something else.
AID00124905	Yeah, I would like that.
AID00124906	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
AID00124907	I could retrieve the caps from your caravan.
AID00124908	But what about those nasty critters?
AID00124909	But, what about the R O U S's?
AID00124910	I've dealt with such things in the past.
AID00124911	Very well, but please do be careful.
AID00124912	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
AID00124913	It is so rare to meet good friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
AID00124914	Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist.
AID00124915	Oh I assure you, sir, they are very real and very large. Please do be careful.
AID00124916	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
AID00124917	It is so rare to meet good friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
AID00124918	<Barter>
AID00124919	[SUCCEEDED] I'm short 90 caps or so, but I have a few cartons of cigarettes and some sensor modules I could put toward my debt.
AID00124920	At this point I'll have to return to California to start anew. I haven't got a cap to my name.
AID00124921	I find it hard to believe you ran from the caravan without taking something.
AID00124922	[FAILED] I don't even have enough caps to get a new caravan up and running. What makes you think I have enough to afford anything else of value?
AID00124923	Lady, you've got to have extra stuff on you somewhere.
AID00124924	<Perception>
AID00124925	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. I didn't want to hand over all of my caps because I won't have enough to get home to California.
AID00124926	Here, take it all. I'll find my way home one way or another.
AID00124927	Jane, I can tell you're lying through your teeth.
AID00124928	<Lady Killer>
AID00124929	[SUCCEEDED] Oh you charming wonderful hunk of man. I agree, I cannot risk my reputation on such a paltry sum.
AID00124930	Here is what I owe, paid in full. I may scrape a bit to get home to California, but I'm a resourceful woman.
AID00124931	Here is the last known location of my caravan if you feel like looking for it. Until we meet again, handsome.
AID00124932	Jane, surely a lady of your stature has honor sufficient to pay her debts.
AID00124933	Goodbye.
AID00124934	Sure, kid, see ya.
AID00124935	I'm not sure yet, but I had some other questions first.
AID00124936	Sure, whatcha need?
AID00124937	I thought maybe I'd talk to the man. See if we can work out a deal.
AID00124938	Yeah? That's ballsy. Good luck with that.
AID00124939	Benny has reprogrammed a Securitron, he's trying to take over the Strip.
AID00124940	He's what? Ah jeez... jeez, this is really bad. What are you going to do?
AID00124941	I haven't had a chance to look yet.
AID00124942	All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
AID00124943	I've bugged the tower for you.
AID00124944	Good to hear, but it looks like the bug was deactivated a few minutes after it went online.
AID00124945	It looks like House has some kind of countermeasure in place to prevent evesdropping on his network. We'll get through eventually, just not today.
AID00124946	Here are those medical supplies I promised. Hopefully you won't need to use them. Take care.
AID00124947	It looks like we've started getting reports from the tower's network! I'm sure the others will be able to make some sense of this.
AID00124948	Oh what the hell? The bug went offline! Dammit!
AID00124949	I swear to God that old man has thought of everything. Well, it looks like this was all for nothing, but you did your best. I appreciate the help.
AID00124950	We haven't received any information yet from the bug.  Please report back when you've found a way into House's network.
AID00124951	Not quite yet.
AID00124952	Okay. No rush, but the sooner the Followers can learn about Mr. House's technology, the better.
AID00124953	All right. I'm on it.
AID00124954	Really? Oh, I wasn't expecting you to agree so easily. That's great!
AID00124955	Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
AID00124956	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
AID00124957	VMS18PatrollerThreaten
AID00124958	I strongly suggest you take your leave.
AID00124959	Members only.
AID00124960	This is your last warning.
AID00124961	[Attack] Trespassing.
AID00124962	Not for long.
AID00124963	<Lie> I'm... er... a building inspector. Surprise inspection!
AID00124964	[FAILED] With our dinner in tow? I think not.
AID00124965	[FAILED] If you're a building inspector, I am the secret identity of Mr. House. Kindly remove yourself.
AID00124966	<Lie> Uh... I'm supposed to release the prisoner. Good behavior I guess.
AID00124967	[FAILED] That has to be the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. You're not taking our main course.
AID00124968	[FAILED] I don't know who you are, but you need to return to the Gourmand this instant!
AID00124969	<Lie> Mortimer sent me to move the kid. Thinks one of his own might betray him.
AID00124970	[SUCCEEDED] First he's too trusting, now he doesn't trust any of us. It addles the senses.
AID00124971	I suppose caution is the desirable course at this point. It's all of our necks if something goes afoul.
AID00124972	<Lie> Water main burst upstairs. They sent me down to survey the damage.
AID00124973	[FAILED] With our dinner in tow? I think not.
AID00124974	[SUCCEEDED] Curse it all. Your timing couldn't be more atrocious. Just make it quick, all right?
AID00124975	Just passing through.
AID00124976	You're trying to help him escape!
AID00124977	Well be a dear and lend a hand upstairs in the banquet hall, if you can. They're in need of more able bodies.
AID00124978	You need to turn around and leave right now, or I shall be forced to draw my cane.
AID00124979	VMS18PatrollerMembersOnlyAttack
AID00124980	You aren't allowed up there!
AID00124981	
AID00124982	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? I like you. Half of the people around here, they forget who runs this place.
AID00124983	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin miss him.
AID00124984	I'm new in town, and wanted to pay my respects.
AID00124985	[FAILED] No, trust me, the King will want to see you if I want you to see him. Come back when you figure out how the world works.
AID00124986	Trust me, the King will want to see me.
AID00124987	I don't have much on me.
AID00124988	Then the King has no interest in seeing you.
AID00124989	
AID00124990	She said what? Why didn't she just say so when I was there? Actually, come to think of it, I was pretty angry when I went down there.
AID00124991	I vaguely recall something about upending a few tables, maybe knocking out one of her doctors. Anyway, that's incredible news!
AID00124992	Only thing is, there's too much going on around here for me to make a trip like that, and I need all of my guys just to keep things settled here.
AID00124993	You seem to be awfully interested in my boy Rex here. And you've done some good work for me already. I'll tell you what.
AID00124994	You promise to get Rexie here to that doctor, and I'll lend him to you. What do you say?
AID00124995	Julie Farkas said a man in Jacobstown can treat Rex.
AID00124996	Yes? Did you reconsider?
AID00124997	About Rex...
AID00124998	Let's talk about something else.
AID00124999	What did you want to talk about?
AID00125000	Thank you. You've been very helpful.
AID00125001	No problem.
AID00125002	Not interested. Sorry.
AID00125003	I'll accept your original offer.
AID00125004	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125005	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125006	Where did the Three Families come from?
AID00125007	Tribals, nothing special. Spend some time in the casinos and you'll catch the gist of each Family.
AID00125008	The only requirement was that the tribals agree to follow my directions. Some, like the Khans and the Kings, did not - and suffered for it.
AID00125009	How did you establish New Vegas?
AID00125010	We can discuss this in greater detail at another time. Suffice it to say that when my Securitrons detected NCR scouts at Hoover Dam, I took action.
AID00125011	I recruited a tribal force to supplement my Securitrons and renovated the Strip just in time to welcome the NCR as it marched into the region.
AID00125012	Instead of war, a treaty was negotiated. And the money started to pour in.
AID00125013	Why can't you be the one to tell Swank?
AID00125014	By contract, Securitrons are to enter the casinos only when invited by the Three Families or if other extraordinary circumstances arise.
AID00125015	The moment I send one into the Tops, Benny will know I'm on to him.
AID00125016	Are Marilyn and Jane your... girlfriends?
AID00125017	I have a few questions before I decide.
AID00125018	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125019	The Chairmen are your employees. Don't they take orders?
AID00125020	It's more complicated than that. The Chairmen share what you might call a... tribal affinity.
AID00125021	Look for a man named Swank, Benny's second-in-command. He's always been a reliable, if unimaginative, employee.
AID00125022	Do your best to convince him that you're working under my auspices. If you have evidence of Benny's crimes, show it to him.
AID00125023	Any ideas on how I could catch him off-guard?
AID00125024	Sneaking into Benny's suite on the 13th floor would be very difficult... but not impossible.
AID00125025	There might be guards. Certainly there'd be a sturdy lock on his front door.
AID00125026	Say I want to take a diplomatic approach.
AID00125027	If you were to approach Benny in public, you might be able to leverage his fear of exposure to make him agree to meet with you in private.
AID00125028	How do I get to Benny?
AID00125029	It won't be easy... Benny is always surrounded by at least four bodyguards - except when he's in his private suite on the 13th floor of the Tops...
AID00125030	Isn't that overstating things a bit?
AID00125031	To your untrained eyes, it may look as though mankind is making a comeback. In the NCR, you have something that remsembles a nation state.
AID00125032	Savage as it is, in Caesar's Legion, you have an organized society. But neither of these offer a future. They're regurgitations of the past.
AID00125033	Bring me the Platinum Chip, and in ten years you'll hardly recognize this city.
AID00125034	What happens if the Platinum Chip is never lost?
AID00125035	Then Vegas shall be lost, and with it, mankind's best hope for long-term survival.
AID00125036	Why don't you send your robots into the Tops to arrest Benny?
AID00125037	Frontal assaults on casinos? Not good for business.
AID00125038	In any case, Benny would see it coming. And all he'd have to do is hold the Chip up and point a pistol at it.
AID00125039	Our foremost advantage is that Benny doesn't know that I know he has the Chip - let's not squander it.
AID00125040	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125041	If the Chip's so valuable, why use a single courier to transport it?
AID00125042	You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them dummies, so to speak?
AID00125043	Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach.
AID00125044	Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world "this is important. Attack this!"
AID00125045	I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.
AID00125046	I have a right to know more.
AID00125047	That's simply not true.
AID00125048	I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly.
AID00125049	To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting.
AID00125050	For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it.  And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here.
AID00125051	We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.
AID00125052	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125053	Why did Benny betray you?
AID00125054	I have to think that he found out about the Platinum Chip and mistakenly convinced himself that he could use it to his own ends.
AID00125055	One of the problems of a tribal work force, I'm afraid. No intuitive understanding of how complex technologies can be.
AID00125056	What use would you have for a protege?
AID00125057	To achieve my aims, I require a capable human agent to perform certain... tasks.
AID00125058	I knew Benny was ambitious, even ruthless. But I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately.
AID00125059	Obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacy. But in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.
AID00125060	Why didn't you intervene sooner when Benny ambushed me?
AID00125061	Why didn't Victor intervene sooner, you mean?
AID00125062	Goodsprings is a bit too far away for me to reliably control a Securitron agent by remote. I can send and receive packets of data, at best.
AID00125063	Victor's combat algorithms determined the proper course of action. Benny and his thugs were more than a match for a lone Securitron.
AID00125064	When he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after Benny and the others had departed.
AID00125065	Now you need to settle that debt with the Garrets.
AID00125066	Sir, Santiago told you. Santiago has no debts.
AID00125067	<Speech>
AID00125068	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
AID00125069	50 caps without even knowing the details of this code? How about 25?
AID00125070	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
AID00125071	25 caps, take it or leave it.
AID00125072	<Speech>
AID00125073	I'm kidding, ha ha! There is no discount. Sorry!... Please don't kill me.
AID00125074	I can give you this tip, though. I have seen a few people go to the pawn shop then somehow get through the south gate to Vegas without caps.
AID00125075	Coincidence? I think not. Ralph and Mick have something going on there, but they refuse to let me in on it.
AID00125076	<Glare> You should give me this code for free while you can still walk straight.
AID00125077	I appologize, friend, but that is absurd given the value of this information.
AID00125078	Give it to me for free, now!

AID00125083	I will need more than that to recoup travel expenses.
AID00125084	[FAILED] Sorry, but that is the best I can do.
AID00125085	That's chimp pay!

AID00125090	Ha! Who are you kidding! I need double!

AID00125094	I'll expect 100 caps *minimum* for each candidate I bring in.
AID00125095	Just don't rough up the merchandise before delivery - you break it, you bought it.
AID00125096	I'm not going to be your pimp.
AID00125097	Oh, I'd still be the pimp - you'd just be my pissant recruiter is all. Let me know if you change your mind.
AID00125098	I'll see if I run across any suitable candidates.
AID00125099	Just direct them to the Wrangler. I'll pay you when they show up.
AID00125100	Maybe later.
AID00125101	Come on back and see me if you change your mind.
AID00125102	What sort of "proclivities" are we talking about?
AID00125103	Our wealthiest client has a thing for ghouls, and a thing for cowboys. He wants an escort who can satisfy both fetishes.
AID00125104	Plenty of customers have said they'd be willing to pay extra for a suave talker, someone who can fake the "boyfriend experience" real good.
AID00125105	And then there's these disgusting robot fetishists you may have heard about? Well, those creeps want a sexbot.
AID00125106	Have you ever run across a sexbot? Not that I'd ever want one within 100 feet of me - but I gotta be a businessman about it.
AID00125107	Do you have any work you need done?
AID00125108	We've got the basics covered, but now that you mention it, we have had unusual requests from some of our wealthier customers.
AID00125109	If you can recruit escorts to match these customers'... proclivities... I'd be willing to pay you finder's fees.
AID00125110	I still need those escorts if you're interested.
AID00125111	Who's supplying you?
AID00125112	If I had two caps to scrape together I'd buy the materials to make my own, but my damn hands won't stop shaking.
AID00125113	This guy named Dixon. Something about him seems sketchy, but I can't stop now. Last time I stopped, I felt like I was going to turn inside out.
AID00125114	At this point, I'm mostly buying his stuff just so I don't feel sick. Speaking of which, do you have any spare caps?
AID00125115	Goodbye.
AID00125116	Yep.
AID00125117	What do you do out here?
AID00125118	We're here to make sure the Legion doesn't try to sneak around Lake Mead and come at NCR from another direction.
AID00125119	Maybe you're lying to keep morale up.
AID00125120	Do a fucking headcount, then. Everybody's right where they're supposed to be.
AID00125121	Reyes' information says otherwise.
AID00125122	Any injury, illness, or death gets radioed to Ranger HQ at Camp Golf.
AID00125123	Chief Hanlon and his aides compile the reports and assign reinforcements as needed, and they're not needed here.
AID00125124	How is Cachino going to be handled?
AID00125125	He'll be handled in the way the Family handles these situations. I want you there for this, come meet me in my office.
AID00125126	Come to my office and you'll see.
AID00125127	Actually I have some other business to take care of.
AID00125128	Thanks for wasting my time.
AID00125129	I wanted to ask you another question first.
AID00125130	Make it snappy.
AID00125131	
AID00125132	[SUCCEEDED] Ok, that sounds fair.
AID00125133	I'll give it to you for 200 caps.
AID00125134	[FAILED] You're real funny. Man, I haven't had a laugh like that in days. Thanks. Now, let's get real here.
AID00125135	I'll give you the journal for... um... 5% of Gomorrah's earnings.
AID00125136	[SUCCEEDED] This'll be worth your while. I wouldn't be here talking to you otherwise.
AID00125137	This will be worth your while, so much that you won't regret paying 300 caps for it.
AID00125138	[FAILED] I'm not sure if you're funny or just stupid, but I'm not amused. Make me a real offer and we can talk.
AID00125139	You give me 4500 caps and I'll let you look at the proof I found.
AID00125140	Is it worth 100 caps to you?
AID00125141	Here, now give it over.
AID00125142	What the fuck is this shit? Cachino, you dumb motherfucker. Yeah, we are going to have some words with Cachino. Meet me in my office.
AID00125143	I have proof one of your Lieutenants is dealing behind your back.
AID00125144	Do you now? Let's see it.
AID00125145	Like hell you do, show me what you have or get the fuck out of my face.
AID00125146	
AID00125147	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, calm down. I'm just doing my job. Go talk to the bosses, one of them should be upstairs. Look for Big Sal or Nero.
AID00125148	I'll tell Cachino to head upstairs.
AID00125149	It involves Cachino, and if you don't let me through it'll involve you too.
AID00125150	[FAILED] I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but this is my gate and I'm the gatekeeper.
AID00125151	What I have is for their eyes only, not some lowly thug.
AID00125152	My business with the bosses is my business, not yours.
AID00125153	It's my fucking job, and no one sees the bosses unless I give the okay.
AID00125154	One of your soldiers has been breaking family rules, here is the proof.
AID00125155	Yeah, give me what you got.
AID00125156	What the fuck? Oh shit. Yeah, go talk to Nero or Big Sal upstairs. They'll want to see this. I'll send Cachino to the office as well.
AID00125157	Nevermind, I'm done now.
AID00125158	Good, get lost.
AID00125159	I have business with your bosses.
AID00125160	What business is that?
AID00125161	What is Zoara?
AID00125162	Zoara is our club. The Family club. If you got business with the bosses, you can go upstairs to talk to them.
AID00125163	What do you mean by Family?
AID00125164	Family, the fucking Omertas. Are you new around here or what?
AID00125165	<Speech>
AID00125166	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
AID00125167	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
AID00125168	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
AID00125169	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
AID00125170	[FAILED] I don't have any more than that to give! I'm sorry!
AID00125171	Hey, you made me look like a fool!
AID00125172	Goodbye, and I better not hear about you trying this crap again.
AID00125173	You won't! I'll be clean as a whistle!
AID00125174	Thanks, but I'm still going to kill you.
AID00125175	No! Don't!
AID00125176	Santiago says the password is extravaganza for a discount.
AID00125177	You aren't the first poor sucker who's come in here saying that. We don't do discounts here.
AID00125178	Sounds like you were ripped off. I'd go get your money back from Santiago.
AID00125179	I'm going to kill you now.
AID00125180	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
AID00125181	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
AID00125182	Your discount was a lie.
AID00125183	Santiago knows not of what you speak.
AID00125184	Cachino mentioned you had something big planned.
AID00125185	Did he now? Funny that, more backstabbing. Yeah, we got something big planned. I was actually hoping to jaw at you about that.
AID00125186	Now that Cachino is gone, we need some help wrapping some things up, and you seem like the resourceful type.
AID00125187	Okay, what do you need to know?
AID00125188	I have more questions about your plans.
AID00125189	VMS21CachinoExecution3
AID00125190	You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
AID00125191	I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
AID00125192	VMS21CachinoExecution2
AID00125193	I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
AID00125194	I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
AID00125195	VMS21CachinoExecution1
AID00125196	Cachino, you've really disappointed me.
AID00125197	Cachino, we've been friends for a long time. A real long time, but this time you really fucked up.
AID00125198	I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
AID00125199	I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
AID00125200	You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
AID00125201	I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.

AID00125210	You're the boss, boss.
AID00125211	Easy as a heart transplant.
AID00125212	Okay.
AID00125213	All right.
AID00125214	I buy that.
AID00125215	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00125216	<bark!>
AID00125217	Makes sense to me.
AID00125218	I hear you.
AID00125219	Got it.
AID00125220	No need to get bossy, dear. Grandma can hear you.
AID00125221	FollowersGiveOrder
AID00125222	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
AID00125223	I'm already doing that.
AID00125224	That's sounding dangerously close to a plan, boss.
AID00125225	I'm hardly a whirlwind of death when left to my own devices, but all right.
AID00125226	I'm already doing that.
AID00125227	I'll follow your lead.
AID00125228	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00125229	<Aggression Level::Passive>
AID00125230	I like this plan where you're the decoy.
AID00125231	What a coincidence! I've been doing that all this time!
AID00125232	[Rex is already waiting for you to attack enemies first.]
AID00125233	<bark!>
AID00125234	Thought I was already holding back.
AID00125235	Heard you the first time, no need to repeat yourself.
AID00125236	Guess it's leftovers for me.
AID00125237	Slim pickings, but all right.
AID00125238	Yes, dearie, that's what grandma's been doing. And Leo isn't happy about it, either.
AID00125239	Ohh, Leo's not going to like that....
AID00125240	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
AID00125241	Just like you said five minutes ago. Don't worry, boss, I got it.
AID00125242	Understood. I won't hesitate.
AID00125243	Shoot first, poke bodies later. Got it, boss.
AID00125244	I'm already doing that.
AID00125245	Good. Makes things simple.
AID00125246	You mean like, even more?
AID00125247	Beats waiting till they shoot me first.

AID00125254	I'll do like I'm doing then - except I'll try to smile less.
AID00125255	What, was I not doing it right before?
AID00125256	Got a habit of repeating yourself.
AID00125257	Never get tired of hearing that.
AID00125258	Now we're talking.
AID00125259	With a smile.
AID00125260	You can keep repeating yourself all day, dearie, but I remember what you said.
AID00125261	That's eactly what Leo told me to do!
AID00125262	I found some chlorine for you.
AID00125263	Great. Yeah, this is just what I needed.
AID00125264	Actually, I was curious if you sell chlorine to The Ultra-Luxe.
AID00125265	Funny you should mention that, I do have a bit of chlorine here.
AID00125266	Normally I wouldn't sell that to just anyone, but you were so helpful getting us Omerta business again, I'll set some aside for you to buy.
AID00125267	I do, but that's some dangerous stuff. I don't sell it to just anyone, I have to be a responsible businessman.
AID00125268	I don't think I want to get involved in this.
AID00125269	Hey, you know what I need, find it or I'll find another way to get it. You're the one that offered.
AID00125270	Where can I find some chlorine gas?
AID00125271	I'm not sure exactly. There is a swimming pool at The Ultra-Luxe, so they probably have some, although I doubt they'd appreciate you taking it.
AID00125272	But they must get it from somewhere, maybe try out in Freeside somewhere.
AID00125273	Let's talk about this a little later.
AID00125274	Okay, come find me whenever you want to chat.
AID00125275	I have a couple other questions to ask you instead.
AID00125276	Yeah, of course. Ask away.
AID00125277	What did you have in mind?
AID00125278	I figure chlorine gas is the way to go. It's toxic, and I can rig it up to do a whole lot of killing in a fairly short timeframe.
AID00125279	
AID00125280	[SUCCEEDED] Spot on, you're a bright one.
AID00125281	A gas, perhaps chlorine? It is a deadly nerve gas and not too hard to come by.
AID00125282	[FAILED] Yeah, I could  build a nuke, but I'm not looking to turn the Mojave into a giant mirror.
AID00125283	No, I was thinking something more subtle.
AID00125284	Er... Maybe you could build a nuke?
AID00125285	How can I be of assistance?
AID00125286	Well, since I can't hope to get all the killing done that they need to get done with bombs, I've been thinking about some alternatives.
AID00125287	What do you need the bombs for?
AID00125288	Blowing shit up, of course. Thing is, they don't need things to blow up, they need people to die in a fairly large area in a fairly small timeframe.
AID00125289	There are other ways to kill people with bombs aside from explosions, if you know what I mean.
AID00125290	The Bosses sent me to offer you assistance.
AID00125291	Oh, that's great. I could sure use some help. You see, I do explosives, and they have a special need for some big explosions.
AID00125292	Problem is, there's no way I can get enough explosives to do the type of damage they're looking to do, much less get it all deployed.
AID00125293	How did you end up with one of the hotel suites?
AID00125294	I'm a close friend of some of the Family around here. I do some independent contracting around the casino, and they set me up with this great room.
AID00125295	What do you do around here?
AID00125296	A little bit of this, and a little bit of that.
AID00125297	What was Cachino's role in the plan?
AID00125298	As one of our captains, Cachino was kind of like a project manager. He made sure people had what they needed to get their jobs done.
AID00125299	Cachino was my Man Friday. He took care of what needed to be taken care of. Had no idea what a dumb son of a bitch he was.
AID00125300	I don't have any more questions right now.
AID00125301	Alright, come back any time.
AID00125302	Come find me when you have something you need to say.
AID00125303	Let's talk about something else
AID00125304	What's on your mind?
AID00125305	Okay, let's chat.
AID00125306	Tell me about the plan.
AID00125307	The plan is called Racket, but that's all the info you're going to get out of me right now.
AID00125308	We call it Racket, and it is going to show Not-At-Home and every other fucker in our business just what the Family can do.
AID00125309	What kind of help do you need?
AID00125310	Two of the players, Troike and Clanden, have some problems that need to be solved. Ask them what they need.
AID00125311	We have two contractors, a guy named Troike and one named Clanden. They've both been running into some issues.
AID00125312	Are you trying to kill your customers?
AID00125313	Those fools are from NCR. I love seeing those squatters in agony.
AID00125314	We were doing just fine before those shits came here and made a mess of things. We don't need NCR eggheads wandering around confusing things.
AID00125315	I found those weapon parts you needed.
AID00125316	Well, hot shit. Thank you. Must have been a real bitch getting it from the Fiends, thanks.
AID00125317	That's all I have for questions right now.
AID00125318	Alright, you know where to find me.
AID00125319	I want to ask about something else.
AID00125320	Okay, what's on your mind?
AID00125321	I have a couple more questions.
AID00125322	Okay, what do you need to know?
AID00125323	I'll keep an eye out for them.
AID00125324	Great, thanks.
AID00125325	Do you mean these weapon parts?
AID00125326	What the hell? You got this from the Fiends already? Hot damn, you really are good. Thanks, this is exactly what I needed.
AID00125327	Why do you work for the Omertas?
AID00125328	Sorry, that's my business and no one else's.
AID00125329	How are you getting the weapons into the strip?
AID00125330	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
AID00125331	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
AID00125332	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
AID00125333	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
AID00125334	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
AID00125335	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
AID00125336	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
AID00125337	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
AID00125338	Tell me about the problem with the last shipment.
AID00125339	The Fiends, a group of raiders freaked out on chems, stole my last shipment before I could get it into Vegas.
AID00125340	I could sure use some help getting it from them.
AID00125341	
AID00125342	[SUCCEEDED] Um... I think that sounds reasonable... As long as you aren't going to do anything dangerous with it, I guess I can spare some.
AID00125343	I'm looking to make some carbon tetrachloride for fire suppression.
AID00125344	[FAILED] I don't know much about biology, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't make a damn bit of sense.
AID00125345	I... Um... Need it to make chlorophyll for plants...
AID00125346	Your bosses sent me to you to see if you needed any help with your work for them.
AID00125347	Yeah, I heard you might be coming. I appreciate the help, I'm in kind of a fix.
AID00125348	I help the Omertas get guns without the NCR catching wind of it. I need someone to cover my ass with the last shipment.
AID00125349	
AID00125350	I heard, we'll be needing those guns. Word on the street is you handled those Fiend freaks like a real pro.
AID00125351	I helped Troike out, like you asked.
AID00125352	Yeah, I heard. I wasn't sold on the whole gas thing. He's the expert though. It sounds like this chlorine thing is going to work out real well.
AID00125353	I finished that work for Clanden.
AID00125354	I heard you did some good work for us. Thank you. Here's a little cash from us to you. Try not to spend it all in one place.
AID00125355	I'm all done with that work you needed.
AID00125356	BMTabithaDishHutGetHim
AID00125357	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
AID00125358	Keep up the attitude soon you'll be on the ground, for good.
AID00125359	[SUCCEEDED] Hey... I'm just worked up, okay. You're tough, right? You won't care about my stupid rambling then?
AID00125360	Goodbye.
AID00125361	Good riddance.
AID00125362	Until next round.
AID00125363	I want to ask you some questions.
AID00125364	And I want a cute patron of this shit-hole to blow me over the pool-table, but that ain't happening either, is it?
AID00125365	I'm in - ask.
AID00125366	Looks like you could use a friendly ear right now. What's up?
AID00125367	[FAILED] Shit, not even down this rat-hole can I drink in peace? I don't need no friends. I just need you to get the fuck out of my sight.
AID00125368	As good a place as any - though here you are drinking yourself *under* ground.
AID00125369	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha! - damn straight! This is about the last place in this fucking city where I can burrow without having to look over my shoulder.
AID00125370	I need one too. Here, next round's on me.
AID00125371	Allright! I won't turn down a freebie. Shit, these days I almost can't pay my own in this two-faced, goddamn city any more.
AID00125372	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
AID00125373	Yes, sir!
AID00125374	Yes, ma'am!
AID00125375	I suppose I should test you out before I hand you to the Garrets...
AID00125376	Servos active!
AID00125377	My pleasure is for you to work at the Atomic Wrangler.
AID00125378	Fisto will report to the Atomic Wrangler for further orders.
AID00125379	What?! No!
AID00125380	I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position.
AID00125381	That is a mouthful. Let's shorten that to Fisto.
AID00125382	Yes, sir. Fisto reporting for duty.
AID00125383	Please assume the position.
AID00125384	Yes, ma'am. Fisto reporting for duty.
AID00125385	Please assume the position.
AID00125386	So you're a bounty hunter?
AID00125387	Bingo. Now if you're done asking stupid questions, I have more important things to do.
AID00125388	What do you do around here?
AID00125389	Hunting and killing, plain and simple.
AID00125390	Cachino sent me to talk to you.
AID00125391	Cachino? Yeah I've heard the name. Not sure why he'd send you to me, is he helping out with room service or something?
AID00125392	I spoke to Clanden, and I couldn't get anything out of him.
AID00125393	Yeah this is Clanden, this guy is one sick motherfucker. The way I see it you have a few options.
AID00125394	Maybe you could use what's on these tapes to get him by himself, or maybe you could use them to leverage him out of the casino.
AID00125395	I found these tapes in Clanden's room, can you verify this is him?
AID00125396	I figured you might have that problem. That guy is pretty much a mystery. I did some asking around about him, on the down-low of course.
AID00125397	Turns out the bosses' plans are right fucked without him. Killing him would probably work wonders, just don't let anyone see you do it.
AID00125398	I'll show it to you for 100 caps.
AID00125399	I'll show you what I have, but if it doesn't rock my world then we're going to have a long talk.
AID00125400	What kind of business do you do here?
AID00125401	All kinds of business, most of it is ours.
AID00125402	Can't say that I do, sorry.
AID00125403	Ah well. It was worth a shot.
AID00125404	Yeah, he's probably dead anyways. You should just get a life.
AID00125405	Sounds like you should move on. Settle down, maybe.
AID00125406	Maybe I should. Don't suppose you know anyplace a feller with a guitar might find a job, huh?
AID00125407	He sounds like a scumbag. You should make him pay.
AID00125408	Maybe I will. Or maybe I'll just ask him why he left. Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
AID00125409	And what will you do when you find him?
AID00125410	Can't say as I really know. Maybe I'll just ask him why. Maybe I'll punch him right in the mouth.
AID00125411	Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
AID00125412	You were better off without him. You became your own man, outside of his shadow.
AID00125413	I suppose there's that, but a man oughta know his own Pa, and a woman oughtn't have to work herself to an early grave to provide for her family.
AID00125414	After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
AID00125415	It must have been hard growing up without a father.
AID00125416	It sure wasn't easy. Ma worked her fingers to the bone to make sure we had enough to survive, and I worked the coal mines from when I was fifteen.
AID00125417	After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
AID00125418	Let's change the subject.
AID00125419	I'm sure he had a reason for leaving.
AID00125420	Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that don't change the fact that it wasn't right.
AID00125421	Sounds like you miss him. Is that why you're out here wandering?
AID00125422	Maybe. Maybe I just never felt like I belonged back home.
AID00125423	No reason. Well, uh, say, let's talk about something else.
AID00125424	Oh thank God. Forget it. Never mind. So your father left?
AID00125425	Wait, Montana? You wouldn't happen to be 17, would you?
AID00125426	No sir, I'm 28. Why?
AID00125427	Smart guy. Families just tie you down.
AID00125428	Maybe that's how you was raised, but where I come from a man does right by his wife and child or he ain't no kinda man at all.
AID00125429	Your father abandoned you?
AID00125430	That he did. Never did know why. Ma always said he was a real mysterious feller, even when he was with her. Like he was a stranger sometimes.
AID00125431	Oh, okay then, never mind.
AID00125432	Anything else you'd like to know?
AID00125433	Nevertheless, I'm interested.
AID00125434	Well, I was born in a little town out Montana way. Me and Ma didn't have much, ever since my pa up and left.
AID00125435	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125436	Looking for a story, huh? All right, what can I tell you?
AID00125437	When did your father leave?
AID00125438	Long time ago, now. I never even knew him. Ma always said he was a mysterious feller, always traveling on in secret.
AID00125439	Have you been playing long?
AID00125440	Just about my whole life, ever since my daddy left ma and me and went off to roam the wastes.
AID00125441	On second thought, I don't think you're the right fit after all.
AID00125442	No apologies needed, friend - I'm sure there's somebody out there'll appreciate my singing.
AID00125443	If I give you his card, what's in it for me?
AID00125444	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's only right you get a little something for your troubles. Here - my daddy left me this gun. Guess I don't need it no more.
AID00125445	I'm giving you a real opportunity here - how about some compensation?
AID00125446	[FAILED] I'm sure Mr. Torini already took care of your fee. Maybe you ought to talk to him. Much obliged for the opportunity, friend. See you around.
AID00125447	Here, take his card. Tell him I sent you.
AID00125448	Much obliged to you, friend.
AID00125449	Tommy offered me a recruiting fee.
AID00125450	Well, at least you're honest, I guess. Sorry, I just don't take charity from strangers.
AID00125451	No game. I offered to keep an eye out for talented acts, is all.
AID00125452	Uh-huh. Sorry stranger, just not sure I trust that kind of charity from somebody I don't even know.
AID00125453	That's a mighty fine guitar you got there.
AID00125454	Oh, this old thing? Why, thanks, friend. This here guitar is just about the only thing my daddy left me.
AID00125455	Tommy Torini at the Tops is looking for musical acts, if you're interested.
AID00125456	Son, where I come from, a man doesn't just walk up to another man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
AID00125457	Darling, where I come from, a lady doesn't just walk up to a man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
AID00125458	Like I said, I got no reason to take your charity. Not till I know you better.
AID00125459	Hmm.... Maybe it's time to give these tired old bones a rest. All right, show me what you've got.
AID00125460	What's your story, stranger?
AID00125461	My story's a long one, friend, and I can't say as it's all that interesting.
AID00125462	Goodbye.
AID00125463	Okay.
AID00125464	What do you do here?
AID00125465	The Legion's got a major crossing point down at Cottonwood Cove, so we keep an eye on them from up here.
AID00125466	If McCarran would send us some more men, we could do more than watch.
AID00125467	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125468	All right.
AID00125469	How long have you been a slave?
AID00125470	Three years and counting. If I could just get across the river, I'd be free. Not that I'd try it - I've seen what happens when you get caught.
AID00125471	I have some questions about you.
AID00125472	What do you want to know?
AID00125473	Well, that was... different.
AID00125474	Are you uncomfortable? My servos may require adjustment.
AID00125475	No, you performed as intended.
AID00125476	Excellent. Awaiting further orders.
AID00125477	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
AID00125478	I can't feel my legs!
AID00125479	Numbness will subside in several minutes. Awaiting further orders.
AID00125480	VFSFistoKiller
AID00125481	Exterminate!
AID00125482	VFSFistoBusy
AID00125483	Routine active. Please return later.
AID00125484	I found the sexbot you're looking for.
AID00125485	You did? Hot damn! I been looking for one of those for years!
AID00125486	For my customers, I mean... I'm not into that kind of shit.
AID00125487	Fisto is already programmed to respond to your commands.
AID00125488	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
AID00125489	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
AID00125490	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00125491	}It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
AID00125492	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
AID00125493	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
AID00125494	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.

AID00125497	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
AID00125498	<Speech>
AID00125499	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, I'm amazed you even found the thing in the first place.
AID00125500	Here is double for your trouble. Those freaky fetishists ought to be satisfied now.
AID00125501	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
AID00125502	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, I'm amazed you even found the thing in the first place.
AID00125503	Here is double for your trouble. Those freaky fetishists ought to be satisfied now.
AID00125504	First I'd like to discuss payment. This wasn't a cakewalk.
AID00125505	[FAILED] I don't think so. We agreed to a price, and that's what you're getting.
AID00125506	I need double before we talk more.
AID00125507	<Barter>
AID00125508	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, you're right! Something like this, it's worth a little extra because it's going to keep on satisfying you...
AID00125509	Those disgusting fetishists, I mean. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
AID00125510	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
AID00125511	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, you're right! Something like this, it's worth a little extra because it's going to keep on satisfying you...
AID00125512	Those disgusting fetishists, I mean. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
AID00125513	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
AID00125514	[FAILED] Believe me - these things is a mess of trouble to keep maintained! They wear out on you, at the worst possible moment!
AID00125515	So say those disgusting fetishists, anyway. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
AID00125516	Seems like... maybe a robot would be worth more? You think?
AID00125517	I would like to purchase your services.
AID00125518	That will be 10 caps, please.
AID00125519	I am sorry, but you must procure a room first. Please return when you have lodging arranged.
AID00125520	<Pay 10 caps>
AID00125521	Thank you. I will meet you in your room.
AID00125522	Maybe later.
AID00125523	Woohoo! <assume the position>
AID00125524	Servos active!
AID00125525	Never mind, I would like a refund.
AID00125526	Very well. Please return if you require further service.
AID00125527	Where are you from?
AID00125528	A small town in New Mexico. The Legion burned it a few years back - that's how I ended up here.
AID00125529	Do you ever trade with the NCR?
AID00125530	Between having to hire protection and getting slapped with taxes, it's more profitable to stick to Arizona and New Mexico.
AID00125531	But, I do cross the river from time to time when an opportunity comes along.
AID00125532	Is it dangerous to trade with the Legion?
AID00125533	Not at all - they're my best customers. As long as you don't try to sell 'em chems or alcohol, they treat you fair.
AID00125534	Hell, I don't even need to travel with guards most of the time in Legion territory. All the bandits are dead or run off.
AID00125535	Are you part of the Legion?
AID00125536	No, sir. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
AID00125537	No, ma'am. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
AID00125538	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125539	All right.
AID00125540	I'd like to know more about you.
AID00125541	Shoot.
AID00125542	Interested in working for the Garrets?
AID00125543	They already have that pig McCaffery working for them. Do they need another guard?
AID00125544	Still trying to convince me, huh?
AID00125545	If you're looking for work, Tommy Torini is hiring singers at the Tops.
AID00125546	Really? The Tops, huh? Well, it's no Shark Club, but I hear security on the Strip is real tight. Even Mr. Bishop wouldn't hit a joint like that.
AID00125547	I'll check it out. Thanks!
AID00125548	I'll let you know if I find any work for a singer.
AID00125549	You'd do that? Great! I really appreciate that!
AID00125550	That's a tough break. Good luck with that.
AID00125551	Thanks.
AID00125552	You really don't know when to quit, do you?
AID00125553	I guess I don't. That's why I'm here.
AID00125554	Wow. My hat is off to you, that takes some balls.
AID00125555	Thanks, but if Bishop finds me and I don't have his money, my balls are going to be on his trophy wall.
AID00125556	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125557	Sure.
AID00125558	And so because of that you ran all the way to Novac?
AID00125559	I figured it might take him a while to understand his accounting error and cool down a little.
AID00125560	Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
AID00125561	You robbed a casino boss?
AID00125562	"Robbed" is such an ugly word. It's more like I took care of a payroll problem for him.
AID00125563	Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
AID00125564	Aren't you that singer from New Reno? I think I saw you play the clubs there.
AID00125565	Oh, so you have heard of me. Yeah, that's right. I was the big draw at the Shark Club, people used to pay hundreds of caps to see me.
AID00125566	Can't say that I have.
AID00125567	<Lie> Yeah, I do, and it's time for you to suffer!
AID00125568	Please, no!
AID00125569	No, I don't. What makes you think that?
AID00125570	Sorry, it's just... you look like his type, y'know? You got that hard-ass wasteland explorer thing going on.
AID00125571	If you're looking for work as a singer, Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring.
AID00125572	Why would this Mr. Bishop be after you?
AID00125573	Oh, well, that's all just a big misunderstanding, see.
AID00125574	Mr. Bishop, well, he owed me a lot of money, and, y'know, he's a busy guy, so I sort of figured I'd just...take it off his hands.
AID00125575	Why did you come all the way out here from New Reno?
AID00125576	You don't know Mr. Bishop. He's not like the other bosses up there. He knows the Wasteland like the back of his hand, and he likes to wander it.
AID00125577	I knew if I didn't get way the hell away from New Reno, he'd run me down like a dog.
AID00125578	Billy's worth three times what you're paying him.
AID00125579	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's the difference for your cut.
AID00125580	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking!
AID00125581	I want to talk to you about how much you're paying Billy Knight.
AID00125582	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle.
AID00125583	Thanks.
AID00125584	Any day, baby, any day.
AID00125585	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
AID00125586	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
AID00125587	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
AID00125588	Thanks.
AID00125589	Any day, baby, any day.
AID00125590	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
AID00125591	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
AID00125592	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
AID00125593	Tommy wants a profit, he won't pay you what you're worth unless you ask for it.
AID00125594	Look, just hang out here for a bit, I want to make sure you get a deal.
AID00125595	Hey, okay, but don't take too long, I don't want to miss this!
AID00125596	That's your call. Here's his card.
AID00125597	Sure, here's his card.
AID00125598	Sweet daisies, here I come!
AID00125599	Don't sell yourself short. You're worth a lot more than that.
AID00125600	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, geez, what was I thinking? You're right, I oughta go in there with a cool head, tell him how much I'm really worth.
AID00125601	[FAILED] Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but you don't know what it's like.
AID00125602	They offer me a roof over my head and half a Fancy Lad and I'll fold like a classy napkin.
AID00125603	No, you've got to start high! Ask for a million and go from there!
AID00125604	With jokes like that, no wonder you're working the street.
AID00125605	Hey, now, come on! I prefer the term "outdoor entertainment bonanza." Besides, have you seen the caps whores make in this town? I should be so lucky!
AID00125606	So you're looking for your big break?
AID00125607	A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts!
AID00125608	It's very impressive.
AID00125609	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic fella I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
AID00125610	As the bar!
AID00125611	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic dame I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
AID00125612	As the bar!
AID00125613	But we're standing on a street corner in the middle of nowhere.
AID00125614	That's exactly my point, kid. Exactly my point.
AID00125615	Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring entertainers. I could put in a word for you.
AID00125616	Yeah? Hey, you're all right! Tell him I'll do it for a hundred a night! No! Fifty! No, twenty! Ten!
AID00125617	Just don't rob me, and I'll do it!
AID00125618	Hey, I'm just happy to get any kind of work I can.
AID00125619	Have you reconsidered asking for a better price from Tommy?
AID00125620	How long have you been doing comedy?
AID00125621	If you believe my mother, since she first laid eyes on me. First thing she said was "Boy! That's a funny-looking kid!"
AID00125622	I guess I got a face only a mother could love, because nobody else would give me the time of day.
AID00125623	Maybe you can help me, see, I can never tell when it's lunchtime.
AID00125624	Who are you?
AID00125625	The name's Knight. Billy Knight. And this here is what a lifelong career in comedy will get you.
AID00125626	I just have a few questions.
AID00125627	All right, but make it snappy, this isn't exactly a lucrative career enterprise here.
AID00125628	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
AID00125629	Jeez, some people....
AID00125630	Goodbye.
AID00125631	Later.
AID00125632	What are you doing out here?
AID00125633	Keeping watch on the Great Khans mostly. They usually stick around Red Rock Canyon, but at least one large group left recently.
AID00125634	We called it in, but haven't heard anything about any Great Khan incidents. Whatever they're doing, they're keeping a low profile.
AID00125635	Tommy Torini is hiring new acts at the Tops. I think you could make good money.
AID00125636	Too bad I got this ironclad contract with the Garrets. They'll never let me out of it.
AID00125637	Like I told you, I can't go anywhere without getting out of my contract with Garret first. Talk to him, maybe he'll cut me loose if you ask nice.
AID00125638	Are you sure you wouldn't rather go work at the Tops?
AID00125639	Really? You mean I'm finally out of this shithole? That's great! Thank you!
AID00125640	Garrett's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops.
AID00125641	Sure, why not? Nothing left for me here since Garret's dead.
AID00125642	So you perform stand-up comedy, huh?
AID00125643	Eesh, is my act that bad, or are you just that dumb? Yeah, that's right - got me a nice, juicy contract with the management.
AID00125644	So who are you, exactly?
AID00125645	Either you need to get your eyes checked or that "fame is fleeting" thing is true - and since I happen to be world famous, you must be going blind.
AID00125646	Name's Hadrian. Bet you never saw a ghoul in a suit before, huh? Course, you don't exactly strike me as the worldly type.
AID00125647	He's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops now.
AID00125648	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
AID00125649	I'm not suirprised, he's a stubborn, greedy bastard.
AID00125650	I can't think of a more pathetic career choice.
AID00125651	Thanks, but that's not why I'm here.
AID00125652	No, but if there's money in it, I could be.
AID00125653	Yeah, no, we were hoping to find someone who was actually... what's the word... funny? What do you want, kid?
AID00125654	Afraid not.
AID00125655	So, what do you want, then?
AID00125656	That's what your mom said last night. Aw yeah. I went there.
AID00125657	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, not bad! Your timing's terrible and you got no style, but you might make it as a professional heckler.
AID00125658	Why bother? You're embarassing yourself enough as it is.
AID00125659	[FAILED] That doesn't even make any sense! You're not the heckler Garret hired to spice up the show, are you?
AID00125660	I have no idea what you're talking about.
AID00125661	Whoa, why the hostility?
AID00125662	Come on, stay in character! You're supposed to be heckling me!
AID00125663	Watch your mouth, ghoul, or I might just rip your jaw off.
AID00125664	Whoa Nelly! There's insult comedy and then there's psycho comedy! I guess you aren't the heckler Garret hired to spice up my show. What do you want?
AID00125665	Excuse me?
AID00125666	What, you mean you're not part of the act? Heh. Sorry. Thought you were the heckler Garret hired to spice up the shows.
AID00125667	Would you happen to know where I could find a sexbot?
AID00125668	Ha! Are you some kind of machine fetishist or something?
AID00125669	The Garrets are looking to satisfy certain customers.
AID00125670	Heh. Well, the only place I know of locally would be Cerulean Robotics, but that place has been overrun by vermin for years.
AID00125671	If you want to check the place out, you can find it on the west side of Freeside. The entrance is on the back side of the building.
AID00125672	Just watch out for thugs. The rats aren't the only vermin you need to worry about.
AID00125673	Thanks, I'll check it out.
AID00125674	Anything else I can help you with?
AID00125675	Is there a holotape or anything I'll need for the sexbot?
AID00125676	I don't know of any, but if you give me a few days and some caps, I think I could probably make one on my terminal.
AID00125677	Here are the caps. <pay 150 caps>
AID00125678	All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AID00125679	Good to know. I might have you make one later if I can't get it myself.
AID00125680	Just stop back and see me if you need one made. Anything else I can help you with?
AID00125681	<Speech>
AID00125682	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AID00125683	Ralph, I've been a loyal customer to you and Mick. How about 100 caps?
AID00125684	[FAILED] I don't think so. I've got a business to run here, buddy.
AID00125685	Can't you just call it a favor?
AID00125686	<Barter>
AID00125687	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AID00125688	Data modules are rare but generally useless. How about 100 caps for your work?
AID00125689	[FAILED] That is just an insult to my expertise. My work is worth more than that.
AID00125690	50 caps is my best offer.
AID00125691	<Speech High>
AID00125692	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AID00125693	Ralph, I've been directing a lot of business your direction. Call it a favor?
AID00125694	Is the holotape ready yet?
AID00125695	Not yet. Come back later and it should be ready to go.
AID00125696	Yep, here you go. You'll need to use a terminal to upload the data to the robot.
AID00125697	I'm short on caps right now. Maybe later.
AID00125698	Just stop back and see me if you need one made. Anything else I can help you with?
AID00125699	Is there a holotape or anything I'll need for the sexbot?
AID00125700	I don't know of any, but if you give me a few days and some caps, I think I could probably make one on my terminal.
AID00125701	VFSCalebMcCafferyEnd
AID00125702	Piss off, kid. We've got no more business to conduct.
AID00125703	A fight broke out when I presented Hsu's offer. The Kings are all dead.
AID00125704	That's terrible. I suppose the violence against our people will stop, though.
AID00125705	I'll have to spend much of the remaining funds for the operation on damage control, but I can spare this much as compensation for your efforts.
AID00125706	The King accepted Colonel Hsu's offer of help.
AID00125707	Good, good. Hsu's a man you can count on to handle a crisis. I'm just glad that things didn't end in violence.
AID00125708	Here, this is what remains of the funds initially allocated for this operation.
AID00125709	Also, I've been directed to send you on to Colonel Moore at Hoover Dam. She's been following my reports on your exploits with some interest.
AID00125710	As I don't have any further assignments for you, I'd recommend going to see her if you need more work.
AID00125711	The Kings were all killed after the King turned down the ultimatum.
AID00125712	I was afraid this would happen. Freeside will be a little more dangerous for a while, but eventually things will die down.
AID00125713	I expect few people will purposely target NCR citizens for some time to come, which is a relief.
AID00125714	However, the NCR's reputation has taken a huge blow because of this. People are beginning to see not much difference between us and the Legion.
AID00125715	I've been authorized to give you this for your efforts. It's not much, but most of the funds for this operation are now going toward damage control.
AID00125716	The King complied with Colonel Moore's ultimatum.
AID00125717	How unexpected! I was sure a direct confrontation would lead to more fighting, but I'm delighted to be proven wrong.
AID00125718	I wouldn't be surprised if you had something to do with the situation not flaring up, either. Here, I'm sure you deserve every one of these caps.
AID00125719	Also, Colonel Moore has requested your presence at Hoover Dam again. No doubt she has further work for an individual with your skillset.
AID00125720	I'm afraid I don't have any further assignments that would suit you, so you should probably go see her at your earliest convenience.
AID00125721	But you've got another idea. Spit it out.
AID00125722	Is it that obvious? You must understand that while Colonel Moore's job is to get things done, my job is to represent the NCR's best interests.
AID00125723	I guess I'll head over to Colonel Moore, then.
AID00125724	Wait a moment, if you would. While sending you to Colonel Moore is what I'm officially supposed to do, I'd like to propose an alternative.
AID00125725	So what do you suggest?
AID00125726	I'd suggest you speak to Colonel Hsu over at Camp McCarran. He's much more level-headed about this sort of thing.
AID00125727	He's also in a better position to bargain with the people of Freeside, seeing as how he's in charge of water and power distribution in the area.
AID00125728	Still, I'm only mentioning it as an option. My official orders are to direct you to Colonel Moore. Godspeed.
AID00125729	Sending NCR soldiers into Freeside would be a bad idea.
AID00125730	I completely agree. Even if a riot didn't immediately break out, a line will have been crossed, and we'll have made that many more enemies.
AID00125731	That'll show the people in Freeside who's in charge!
AID00125732	More like instigate a mass riot. People there already think the NCR is trying to take this place over. We'd only be confirming their fears.
AID00125733	Sounds like you and the Colonel don't get along.
AID00125734	Oh, I like the Colonel just fine. She's a good soldier, one of the best. I just don't think her general approach to things is a good fit here.
AID00125735	See, the Colonel likes to solve things neatly, quickly, and efficiently, through a show of force if possible, and through actual force if necessary.
AID00125736	That won't work here. Unless she plans on killing half the population of Freeside, sending soldiers to the area will only make things worse.
AID00125737	I'm still working on it.
AID00125738	I understand. Sometimes these things take time.
AID00125739	Remember, do what you can to gain the man's trust. Then you'll have your chance.
AID00125740	The King won't deal with the NCR.
AID00125741	That's most unfortunate. In this circumstance I've been instructed to send you along to Colonel Moore over at Hoover Dam for further orders.
AID00125742	The Colonel will likely send you back to Freeside with a squad of armed men, for all the good that will do.
AID00125743	I spoke to the King, and he promised to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
AID00125744	That's great to hear. He's got a lot of sway in Freeside, so we can expect a dramatic drop in violence soon.
AID00125745	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
AID00125746	Keep me in mind for any future assignments.
AID00125747	I would, but I'm afraid the rest of the work in my queue pertains to matters I'll have to deal with personally. You do have another option, however.
AID00125748	Glad to be of service.
AID00125749	I've received a message from Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam. She's been following your exploits and has requested that you meet with her.
AID00125750	You're not officially in the employ of the NCR, so there's nothing forcing you to go, but I'd go see her sooner rather than later.
AID00125751	The Colonel is not someone you want to keep waiting.
AID00125752	I laced Pacer's Jet with Psycho and it didn't go well for him.
AID00125753	Good show. With the conditions there, no one will suspect anything other than bad drugs to be the culprit. You've done a great service for the NCR.
AID00125754	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
AID00125755	
AID00125756	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I don't officially have access to any more funds, but here. This is from me personally. There's more coming your way, too.
AID00125757	I risked my neck out there. Couldn't you spare a little more?
AID00125758	[FAILED] I'm sorry, but those are the only funds I was able to allocate. You'll have to make due with it. Besides, you may have other tasks soon.
AID00125759	That's it?
AID00125760	I used an energy weapon to kill Pacer, so the Van Graffs should take the blame.
AID00125761	Killing two birds with one stone. Excellent. You've done a great service for the NCR.
AID00125762	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
AID00125763	I discovered that Pacer is a Jet addict and has a heart condition.
AID00125764	That could be useful, but I'm afraid I don't have the background to know how to take advantage of that knowledge.
AID00125765	As I told you before, that could be useful information, but I don't know how to take advantage of it.
AID00125766	I discovered that Pacer and the Van Graffs have a troubled history.
AID00125767	See, that's exactly the type of information we can use. In fact, that's perfect. Those fancy weapons the Van Graffs peddle aren't exactly common.
AID00125768	It goes without saying that actually getting the Van Graffs to do the deed would be the ideal solution.
AID00125769	However, if Pacer were killed with either a laser or plasma-based weapon, everyone would automatically assume the Van Graffs did it.
AID00125770	Still, unless you want several dozen armed men at your throat, you'd have to kill him without being seen. Be careful.
AID00125771	I'll leave the method up to you. However, there is an alternative if you'd rather try to handle things without bloodshed.
AID00125772	Wow, you're really mad.
AID00125773	You better believe I'm mad. You've waged a one man campaign to drag our good name through the mud and I'll be held accountable!
AID00125774	You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. Gah! This is what I get for hiring an idiot to do such an important job.
AID00125775	Here, just take this and go. I have damage control to do.
AID00125776	Wait, I'm supposed to send you to Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam, though why she wants to see an imbecile like you is beyond me.
AID00125777	So go to Hoover Dam and see Colonel Moore. Got it? Hoover Dam. Colonel Moore. Maybe it's time to retire.
AID00125778	I'm sorry. I screwed up.
AID00125779	That's an understatement. Still, there's nothing to be done about it now. Maybe the violence may die down once things settle.
AID00125780	Here, take this. It's not what I was planning to give you, but you deserve some sort of payment for your efforts. Oh, and one other thing.
AID00125781	You wanted a man dead. He's dead. Now where are my caps?
AID00125782	If it will get you out of my hair, this is a small price to pay. At least I won't have to put up with you any longer.
AID00125783	I suppose not.
AID00125784	At least you've got the sense to know you've screwed up. I'll probably be cleaning toilets by the end of the week. But you'll be busy, too.
AID00125785	When you put it that way... yes.
AID00125786	Oh, I see. You're proud of your efforts, eh? Bah! Thankfully, it looks like we won't be working together any longer.
AID00125787	Let's start with my reward.
AID00125788	Reward? You want a reward for setting our diplomatic efforts back a year?
AID00125789	What's my other choice?
AID00125790	I'm not a violent man myself, so I had our guys come up with an alternate solution on the off chance that our agent-to-be shared my sentiments.
AID00125791	All right, I'll try to find a way.
AID00125792	I'm sure something will turn up. If you think you've found something but are unsure, report back and I'll let you know if it's something we can use.
AID00125793	It may be tough to find a way to completely throw off suspicion, however.
AID00125794	I'm not an assassin.
AID00125795	In that case, we can take a different tack, but one that I at least have more experience with - diplomacy.
AID00125796	If we can't go after the man responsible, we'll simply appeal to the man above him.
AID00125797	The Kings, including our friend Pacer, report to the leader of their gang, a man who calls himself the King.
AID00125798	I was hoping you'd know.
AID00125799	Damn it, I'm an ambassador, not a doctor. You'll have to find some other way.
AID00125800	I'm afraid I can't be much help in this matter. My specialty is people and politics, not medicine.
AID00125801	
AID00125802	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
AID00125803	However, it would involve gaining access to his personal drug stash and tampering with it unseen, which might pose a challenge.
AID00125804	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
AID00125805	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
AID00125806	Maybe the jet will cause his heart to give out.
AID00125807	Pacer's addicted to Jet, even though he has a heart condition.
AID00125808	That could be useful, but I'm afraid I don't have the background to know how to take advantage of that knowledge.
AID00125809	I've heard that there's bad blood between Pacer and the Van Graff family.
AID00125810	See, that's exactly the type of information we can use. In fact, that's perfect. Those fancy weapons the Van Graffs peddle aren't exactly common.
AID00125811	It goes without saying that actually getting the Van Graffs to do the deed would be the ideal solution.
AID00125812	However, if Pacer were killed with either a laser or plasma-based weapon, everyone would automatically assume the Van Graffs did it.
AID00125813	Still, unless you want several dozen armed men at your throat, you'd have to kill him without being seen. Be careful.
AID00125814	I'll leave the method up to you. However, there is an alternative if you'd rather try to handle things without bloodshed.
AID00125815	If I can't just kill him, what did you want me to do?
AID00125816	Make it look like an accident, or pin the deed on someone else. Look into this guy's affairs, and I'm sure you'll find something you can use.
AID00125817	I think I'll pass.
AID00125818	That's too bad. Come back if you change your mind. I'm sure you can see yourself out.
AID00125819	Sure, I'll look into it.
AID00125820	Good. Our men have come up with two different plans for seeing an end to the violence.
AID00125821	First, our sources have tracked most of the attacks back to a King named Pacer. The consensus is that the violence will stop if he's removed.
AID00125822	The problem is that we can't simply kill him. In the current climate, the NCR would likely be blamed for his death.
AID00125823	There is an alternative option, but my sources feel that getting rid of this Pacer fellow is our best shot.
AID00125824	Maybe? I go lots of places. Can't remember them all, you know.
AID00125825	You'd remember this one. It's a pit where people are robbed, murdered, or simply go to die.
AID00125826	No, I haven't.
AID00125827	It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
AID00125828	Yes, what of it?
AID00125829	Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
AID00125830	More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
AID00125831	I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
AID00125832	I have. It's a slum.
AID00125833	I'm inclined to agree, but it's a slum with NCR citizens in it, and as such it falls under my jurisdiction.
AID00125834	
AID00125835	So I did. As you may have noticed, our position here in New Vegas is tenuous.
AID00125836	We've made great strides, sure, but the NCR is not welcomed here, merely tolerated. And even then, not by everyone.
AID00125837	We've had reports of violence against NCR citizens in a neighborhood just to the northeast called Freeside. Ever been there?
AID00125838	Earlier you mentioned another assignment?
AID00125839	Yes, have you reconsidered? NCR citizens may be dying as we speak in that hellhole.
AID00125840	Is that job in Freeside still available?
AID00125841	Oh, I've already heard. Pacer is dead. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
AID00125842	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
AID00125843	What do you have to say for yourself?
AID00125844	I've completed the Pacer job.
AID00125845	Oh, I've already heard. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
AID00125846	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
AID00125847	What do you have to say for yourself?
AID00125848	Uh, the King sort of got killed while I was working on that Freeside job.
AID00125849	Yes, do you have something to report?
AID00125850	I wanted to talk about the situation in Freeside.
AID00125851	Yes, how did it go?
AID00125852	I have an update on the Freeside situation.
AID00125853	You train these dogs?
AID00125854	Been doing it since I was a boy. The mongrels know to listen up when I start talking to them.
AID00125855	Let's talk about something else.
AID00125856	Okay.
AID00125857	Where does the Legion get its dogs?
AID00125858	We breed them, mostly, but sometimes we get some good ones from Denver. That whole city is overrun with them.
AID00125859	I had some questions.
AID00125860	Yeah?
AID00125861	What's being a Bighorn rancher like?
AID00125862	Bighorners' my trade since I was a youngin. I confess it's hard living these days, kid. The Wasteland ain't the same anymore.
AID00125863	Tell me again about your home.
AID00125864	Darn far it is, our ranch. Ethel would be happy to yap about that - I got more important things in mind, kid.
AID00125865	Actually, never mind. Let me ask you about something else.
AID00125866	I'm not interested right now. Sorry, Walter.
AID00125867	I won't hold it against you, kid. You got to do your clean thing, I respect that.
AID00125868	500 and Ted's history.
AID00125869	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00125870	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
AID00125871	Heck's a powerful man - I'd need extra for his son's life, 500 caps.
AID00125872	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
AID00125873	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
AID00125874	I'll take care of them.
AID00125875	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
AID00125876	How is Heck a threat to other ranchers in The Wasteland?
AID00125877	We are honest folk out there, damn hard to make a living in the desert, kid. Heck's a different breed, goddamn thief he is.
AID00125878	Scaring us into giving away our lands is all he's done to strike it flush - comes packing iron and none can hold a candle to his men - bad blood.
AID00125879	Actually, let me consider it first.
AID00125880	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
AID00125881	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00125882	Actually, let me consider it first.
AID00125883	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
AID00125884	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00125885	Actually, let me consider it first.
AID00125886	That's okay, kid. I understand - let me know if you change your mind, will you?
AID00125887	The best don't come cheap, Walter. 400 caps' my fee.
AID00125888	[SUCCEEDED] All right, kid! I'm taking a liking to you. It's a deal.
AID00125889	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
AID00125890	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AID00125891	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
AID00125892	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00125893	I'll find out for you but not cheaply - 400 caps.
AID00125894	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00125895	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
AID00125896	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AID00125897	I may be able to help you.
AID00125898	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
AID00125899	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AID00125900	Heck's looking for his disappeared son. I've agreed to find him.
AID00125901	I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
AID00125902	I'd not be one to complain if he got lost for good, kid... If it makes Heck suffer then I'm all for it.
AID00125903	What do you plan to do about him?
AID00125904	I have no illusions that he'll ever stop his plundering. So I'm just going to make him suffer, that's what I'm going to do.
AID00125905	Here, in town, he's got few of his armed men to protect him. I just got to find out what's he up to and then I'll know where to hit him hard.
AID00125906	Like I said, kid. Someone's got to rein that greedy son of a gun.
AID00125907	Heck claims to be an honest rancher.
AID00125908	Sure, kid, and I still hump like a buck in Spring. That Gunderson's a liar and born of a viper, I swear.
AID00125909	What else can you tell me about Heck Gunderson?
AID00125910	What more you want? He's a slithering snake, what he is. One of the biggest landowners this side of the Colorado and it's all stolen, I tell you.
AID00125911	All that money buys him any NCR senators he wants - scoundrels, like Heck. There's just no way for us small folks to get by, much less prosper, kid.
AID00125912	Are you a Bighorn rancher?
AID00125913	Bighorners' my trade since I was a youngin. I confess it's hard living these days, kid. The Wasteland ain't the same anymore.
AID00125914	You're not from around here, are you?
AID00125915	Darn far it is, our ranch. Ethel would be happy to yap about that - I got more important things in mind, kid.
AID00125916	I want to talk to you about our deal.
AID00125917	I hear you. What's on your mind?
AID00125918	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
AID00125919	Steeling our pure-breed resolve, that's how! We've faced the Wasteland right in the old mug and told her to shove it!
AID00125920	Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
AID00125921	Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
AID00125922	I have news about the Gundersons
AID00125923	You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
AID00125924	Where do you come from?
AID00125925	What was that about settling a score?
AID00125926	There's a long list of grievances that Heck Gunderson's got to answer for, kid. I'm here to make sure that "rancher" stops stealing our lands.
AID00125927	If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny or you're dead.
AID00125928	I'm tired of being trampled over, kid, and I got a good mind to stop Heck once and for all.
AID00125929	I came to take care of Heck Gunderson. That bastard's taking over any ranch he spots in The Wasteland.
AID00125930	Let's talk about Heck Gunderson.
AID00125931	I hear you. What's on your mind?
AID00125932	I'd like to ask you about the Wasteland.
AID00125933	I know it better than my wife's corset! What about it, kid?
AID00125934	I have questions about you.
AID00125935	Okay. What'd you want know?
AID00125936	Goodbye.
AID00125937	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00125938	I'd like to ask you some other questions.
AID00125939	I got some time - what's eating you?
AID00125940	Then have, I don't know, some water or something.
AID00125941	[FAILED] A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
AID00125942	You look more than just too hot - what's the matter?
AID00125943	[SUCCEEDED] Sharp eyes on you, all right. We've gone through a heap of trouble to get in town. Ethel says I just need to wet my throat.
AID00125944	A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
AID00125945	I want to talk about Joana.
AID00125946	Hey, that's great. What's going on?
AID00125947	On second thought - let's wait.
AID00125948	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
AID00125949	All right. I'll talk to her.
AID00125950	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00125951	On second thought - let's wait.
AID00125952	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
AID00125953	All right. I'll talk to her.
AID00125954	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00125955	You know, paying a visit to Joana sounds like fun.
AID00125956	I could talk to Joana for you, but it'll cost you 200 caps.
AID00125957	Don't know... She's a dream to me now... If I, I mean if I could have her again I'd be a made man.
AID00125958	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
AID00125959	Okay - you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
AID00125960	Have you made up your mind?
AID00125961	I can talk to Joana for you.
AID00125962	Don't know... She's a dream to me now... If I, I mean if I could have her again I'd be a made man.
AID00125963	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
AID00125964	Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
AID00125965	Have you made up your mind?
AID00125966	How did Cachino get you out of the way?
AID00125967	He's a cunning bastard, Cachino. Told Nero and Big Sal he caught me spring cleaning my tributes to the family - can't do nothing against that viper.
AID00125968	Why don't you get her out of Gomorrah?
AID00125969	What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
AID00125970	Besides, I step in Gomorrah and I'm as good as dead, you hear? You don't just leave the Omertas unless it's in a body bag.
AID00125971	Why not? It looks private enough for a midnight stunt.
AID00125972	Don't talk to me like that or I'll... I'll... have to get tough with you.
AID00125973	[FAILED] Ha ha ha! Okay, okay... stop or I'll choke, I swear. Listen, kid - I'll cut you some slack because nothing else in this town will, you hear?
AID00125974	Tell me again about the girl at Gomorrah that worries you.
AID00125975	What about Joana?
AID00125976	What did you say about working at Gomorrah?
AID00125977	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
AID00125978	So you live in Vault 21?
AID00125979	This place has come a long way. Sarah takes care of it and she lets me stay, for now.
AID00125980	This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
AID00125981	Tell me about your past.
AID00125982	You know - straightening up bets, Gomorrah, success, women, all that shiny stuff.
AID00125983	Wait a minute. What's that name again?
AID00125984	No dice. I already opened my trap more than I should. Walls have ears even all the way down in this hole, you know? Can't trust nobody.
AID00125985	I can keep a secret, Carlitos. About whom are you worried?
AID00125986	I... Okay, it's Joana. She... works at Gomorrah. But it's all my fault! I met her at the Atomic Wrangler - beautiful doesn't even come close.
AID00125987	I moved her into Gomorrah. I was in love, okay? Then Cachino, backstabbing snake, got me out of the way so that he could have my girl.
AID00125988	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
AID00125989	Because Mr. House ripped this place to shreds before filling it with concrete. Hey, I was untouchable once, but Mr. House's a god - you got that?
AID00125990	What does Sarah do around here?
AID00125991	What doesn't she do, huh? Sarah makes this hole look like a palace - damn nice pair of gams on her too. She never walks outside, though.
AID00125992	Let me ask you something else.
AID00125993	Anyone in Gomorrah you'd recommend for a good time?
AID00125994	I'd recommend you save your caps and your skin. Check The Tops - no big time wiseguys there. Freeside's also fun, you know?
AID00125995	There's too much shit and despair at Gomorrah already. I don't want anybody making it worse for Jo... for the girls, you know?
AID00125996	Any important "wiseguys" that I should know about?
AID00125997	Now, if you have to ask, you probably don't know shit about who you're dealing with, huh? Listen up - watch out for Cachino, that's all I'm saying.
AID00125998	You spent some time at Gomorrah, then. What was it like?
AID00125999	I didn't just spend time there, I lived there, okay? I was family. All I wanted, I had. Caps, booze, drugs, women, power, you name it.
AID00126000	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
AID00126001	You worked in Gomorrah as a Croupier, uh? What was it like?
AID00126002	Hey, you're smart. Okay, it was like finding diamonds in your vodka and showgirls under your card-table. You want it, Gomorrah has it.
AID00126003	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
AID00126004	Any recommendations on where to go for some fun?
AID00126005	My recommendation, get the fuck out of town while you can. It'll leave you hanging in the wind or, worse, add your body to a concrete wall, okay?
AID00126006	I've got other questions about you.
AID00126007	What are the important players in town?
AID00126008	Ha! There's only one important player in town, and that's Mr. House. Everyone keeps clean around him, the families, the barons - fuck, even the NCR.
AID00126009	Tell me about The Strip.
AID00126010	If you're smart, the Strip's all flash and noise. If not, luck's your dame, your hot date, until you find she's a cheap whore high on Jet.
AID00126011	Let me ask you about New Vegas.
AID00126012	All right. What do you want to know?
AID00126013	If Vault 21 is your "bottom of the barrel" then I'd say you could've done worse.
AID00126014	Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
AID00126015	This place has come a long way. Sarah takes care of it and she lets me stay, for now.
AID00126016	Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
AID00126017	This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
AID00126018	How high was that fall?
AID00126019	From the top! Where else, uh? I am Carlitos - my fingers work the magic and my hands deal the luck!
AID00126020	There was no player who'd stood a chance, no wiseguy who didn't fear me, and no doll who could resist me. Gomorrah was my kingdom, Carlitos' turf!
AID00126021	Sounds like you're in trouble. What's the deal?
AID00126022	Who isn't in trouble in New Vegas, uh? Sooner or later, you hit the bottom of the barrel - I just happened to fall harder than most, is all.
AID00126023	I am just one more loser that got the evil-eye from Lady Luck - hard fall. Now I lay at the bottom and keep to myself.
AID00126024	All right. About what do you want to know?
AID00126025	You've got them all wrong.
AID00126026	Wrong, huh? And I suppose they sent all of these soldiers just to make nice. Lucky me.
AID00126027	Actually, they want to make you an offer.
AID00126028	An offer, huh? All right, let's hear it.
AID00126029	VFSKingHsuOfferStart
AID00126030	Let me guess. The NCR couldn't get me to dance to their tune so now they're asking again a little less nicely, right?
AID00126031	VFSNCRCaptainAttacksTheKing
AID00126032	Sounds like he's not going to cooperate, men. Open fire!
AID00126033	The NCR is just trying to protect its people.
AID00126034	And I'm trying to protect mine. If the NCR wants peace so much, the first step would be to get these soldiers out of here.
AID00126035	
AID00126036	[SUCCEEDED] Honestly, I hadn't thought it through that far. I'd guess someone would come and take over this place.
AID00126037	And you can be damn sure they won't run it like the King, baby. They might run everyone out, or enslave them, or worse.
AID00126038	I guess I have no choice. Tell your NCR masters that I accept their terms. I'll see that violence against their people is dealt with.
AID00126039	Now take these fools and get out of here before they start a riot.
AID00126040	And when you're dead? What will happen to their freedom then?
AID00126041	[FAILED] My momma didn't raise no quitter, and I stand by my beliefs. The answer is no.
AID00126042	The NCR is far too powerful. Just give up.
AID00126043	These men have orders to kill you all if you refuse. Are you sure?
AID00126044	That I don't want to sign away my freedom and that of all the people I'm responsible for at gunpoint? Yeah, I'm sure.
AID00126045	There's still time to solve this peacefully.
AID00126046	Says the one with a squad of armed soldiers behind them. No, I don't think a peaceful solution is possible. Not anymore.
AID00126047	The violence needs to stop.
AID00126048	And whose job is it to stop it? Yours? Mine? Who are we to tell people what to do? No man has that right.
AID00126049	I'm afraid so.
AID00126050	Then I must refuse. The people here have the right to do what they want and are beholden to none. I won't take that away from them.
AID00126051	VFSKingUltimatumStart
AID00126052	Let me guess. The NCR couldn't get me to dance to their tune so now they're asking again a little less nicely, right?
AID00126053	Nope. I'm to go to Freeside and shoot up some Kings.
AID00126054	Not exactly. Give them the chance to do the right thing at least. Personally, I doubt they'll do it.
AID00126055	Crocker's been making overtures to these savages for months and gotten nowhere. Expect a fight, but don't look for one.
AID00126056	Dismissed.
AID00126057	This plan seems awfully confrontational.
AID00126058	Do you have any idea what our current situation is? As we speak there is a huge army of madmen not ten miles from here waiting to kill us all.
AID00126059	We don't have the luxury of long-term diplomacy any longer. Anyone that could prove a hindrance in the battle to come must be dealt with swiftly.
AID00126060	You have your orders. I expect you to carry them out.
AID00126061	Dismissed.
AID00126062	No ma'am.
AID00126063	Good. When the task is done, report back to Crocker. My men have other orders and will return here on their own to make their report.
AID00126064	Dismissed.
AID00126065	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about Freeside.
AID00126066	You say Crocker sent you? Let me see... I just received a memo regarding him recently and haven't had a chance to read it in detail.
AID00126067	Ah, the matter with the so-called Kings. Crocker's been wringing his hands while good people die for too long, and now the matter's fallen to me.
AID00126068	Unlike the good ambassador, I don't intend to blink. Tell the leader of this gang to stand down or face annihilation.
AID00126069	That is his choice. If he chooses the latter, a squad of my men will be there to back you up. Any questions?
AID00126070	You know, I just received the strangest memo about Freeside. It said that Colonel Hsu has already dispatched a squad to take care of the problem.
AID00126071	I'll let Hsu's men deal with things, but the good ambassador is going to learn a harsh lesson regarding protocol.
AID00126072	I trust you can find your own way out.
AID00126073	I was, uh, just sightseeing. Sorry to bother you.
AID00126074	Then I suggest you make your way back outside. My men have orders to shoot anyone caught sneaking around in sensitive areas.
AID00126075	I think the authorities would like to hear these tapes I found in your safe.
AID00126076	I think I should kill you before you have a chance to show those tapes to anyone. What do I have to lose?
AID00126077	VMS21ClandenMurderRoom
AID00126078	What the fuck are you trying to pull here? Where is my girl? Now I'm gonna have to kill your sorry ass.
AID00126079	Ok little lady, let's get started. You look like a tough piece of meat, I'm going to enjoy tenderizing you.
AID00126080	Goodbye.
AID00126081	Get lost.
AID00126082	Sorry, I was thinking about someone else. I have a different question though.
AID00126083	Alright, but you're starting to get on my nerves.
AID00126084	I thought that maybe I could be your next playtoy. Your exploits are well known.
AID00126085	Well, look at you! It's so rare I get a volunteer. Yes, let's head to my special room. Follow me, we'll talk there.
AID00126086	
AID00126087	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, already? I figured it would be a couple days. Well, let's go meet the lucky lady.
AID00126088	Oh, I was just told to deliver a girl to the spare room you keep up here.
AID00126089	[FAILED] I don't care much about your tastes. Get lost and leave me alone.
AID00126090	Well... I... I have some exotic tastes too!
AID00126091	I hear you have some exotic tastes when it comes to women.
AID00126092	Oh did you now? What business is that of yours, and why the fuck should I care?
AID00126093	VMS21ClandenArrest01
AID00126094	VMS21ClandenArrest
AID00126095	Clanden, under the authority of the New California Republic, I place you under arrest for murder.
AID00126096	What? Are you fucking kidding me? You can't do this, the Omertas aren't going to stand by and let you arrest me.
AID00126097	The Omertas have no say in this matter. This is a legal matter now. You'll have to come with us.
AID00126098	Alright. I'll come quietly, but this fucked.
AID00126099	Never mind, I have some other questions though.
AID00126100	Ok, ask away.
AID00126101	It is a guy named Clanden.
AID00126102	Clanden? Okay, I'll send some troops over there to bring him in.
AID00126103	No, but I'll find out for you.
AID00126104	Come back here as soon as you do, I'd like to see this asshole behind bars.
AID00126105	I can't say for sure.
AID00126106	Well come back here when you can. I'd like to take care of this as soon as possible.
AID00126107	I found these tapes.
AID00126108	These are terrifying. Do you have any idea who the man is speaking on this tape?
AID00126109	I found a dead girl in Gomorrah.
AID00126110	Well that's something, but I can't go in there without proof of foul play.
AID00126111	Sorry, I'll find some proof.
AID00126112	Okay, this is a very serious accusation. Please be sure to bring me something concrete.
AID00126113	I'd like to report a murder at Gomorrah.
AID00126114	Murder? What kind of Murder? Do you have any proof?
AID00126115	It turns out that Ted Gunderson's disappeared. Heck's looking for him.
AID00126116	I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
AID00126117	I'd not be one to complain if he got lost for good, kid... If it makes Heck suffer then I'm all for it.
AID00126118	I'm surprised you haven't asked what became of Benny.
AID00126119	That's because he ceased to be relevant when you recovered the Platinum Chip. Revenge doesn't interest me, progress does.
AID00126120	Sorry to deny you a moment of primate triumph, but you'll have to go elsewhere to sound your barbaric yawp.
AID00126121	<Change the subject.>
AID00126122	I'm not planning to visit the Fort.
AID00126123	I'm not planning to go to the Fort.
AID00126124	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126125	I've already met with Caesar at the Fort.
AID00126126	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
AID00126127	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
AID00126128	So you want me to go back there and kill Caesar?
AID00126129	What's inside the hatch?
AID00126130	Something very important. I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise - so don't bother asking.
AID00126131	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
AID00126132	I'll do as you ask.
AID00126133	Here, take the Platinum Chip again. You will need it.
AID00126134	Upon arrival at the Fort, it's likely that you'll be searched and the Chip taken from you. Don't worry - it will come back to you.
AID00126135	I expect that if Benny doesn't have the Chip, Caesar will make sure you get it. More on that later. Be off.
AID00126136	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126137	I've already visited Caesar.
AID00126138	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
AID00126139	And what then?
AID00126140	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126141	If you find Caesar's Legion so frightening at this remove, imagine them rampaging across the Strip.
AID00126142	We have a chance to see them detroyed, to see New Vegas become the harbinger of a new age.
AID00126143	I've already visited Caesar.
AID00126144	You have? So you have the means to gain entry?
AID00126145	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
AID00126146	I'm not surprised. The Legion has spies on the Strip.
AID00126147	What do you want me to do there?
AID00126148	I want you to open a hatch in the basement of the derelict weather station atop Fortification Hill.
AID00126149	You'll recognize it on sight. The hatch bears the logo of the Lucky 38, same as the Platinum Chip.
AID00126150	I think that sounds insane.
AID00126151	Not if you've been invited. You realize that you've made quite a splash here in New Vegas?
AID00126152	I can predict with a high degree of confidence that you'll receive an official summons from Caesar. If you haven't already, that is.
AID00126153	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126154	Let me ask some questions first.
AID00126155	I guess you can tell me about the mission.
AID00126156	The Chip's been delivered. We're through.
AID00126157	Do you have any idea how prodigious is the opportunity you're casting aside here?
AID00126158	Let me ask some questions first.
AID00126159	I'm listening.
AID00126160	The next step will require you to infiltrate Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
AID00126161	You'll have to return to Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
AID00126162	I'll be on my way, Mr. House.
AID00126163	No no no, you'll want to hear this out...
AID00126164	Disappointing. In the extreme.
AID00126165	You think your Securitrons can defeat Caesar's Legion *and* the NCR?
AID00126166	Why would I want to go to war against the NCR? They're my best customers.
AID00126167	If their leaders weren't scheming to steal Vegas out from under me, I'd have no troubles with the NCR at all.
AID00126168	Why show your hand like that? Now your enemies know what you're up to.
AID00126169	I'm surprised you can still underestimate me after everything you've seen.
AID00126170	I haven't shown my hand - I've shown one card. I've given my enemies a single, provocative datum upon which to fixate.
AID00126171	They have no idea what other cards I'm holding. It's a strong hand, believe me - I dealt it to myself.
AID00126172	I'll be on my way, then...
AID00126173	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
AID00126174	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role. To get started, all you need do is take the elevator all the way down...
AID00126175	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
AID00126176	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role.
AID00126177	To get started, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level...
AID00126178	What does the Chip do, exactly?
AID00126179	Yes, so far as you've seen, all it does is change the picture on the Securitrons' face screens from policemen to soldiers. But as you'll see...
AID00126180	Some things are more easily shown than told. Take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level, and you'll see what I mean.
AID00126181	Don't worry, you'll like what you see. We have much to accomplish, you and I...
AID00126182	What happens next?
AID00126183	A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
AID00126184	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level. You'll understand soon enough...
AID00126185	A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
AID00126186	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level.
AID00126187	What you see there will help you understand the significance of what you accomplished at the Fort.
AID00126188	I'm still not giving you the Chip.
AID00126189	Then this is a waste of time.
AID00126190	Here, take it. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00126191	Well enough. We can put the past behind us, I think.
AID00126192	Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00126193	You want the Chip? Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00126194	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
AID00126195	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
AID00126196	I have some questions to ask first...
AID00126197	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
AID00126198	I have some questions to ask first...
AID00126199	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
AID00126200	I'm not afraid of you, Mr. House. The Platinum Chip belongs to me.
AID00126201	You needn't be afraid of me. It's my Securitrons that are going to kill you.
AID00126202	Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00126203	Why, thank you so much. You played that very poorly, you realize?
AID00126204	You're fortunate that I have a certain tolerance for greed. I expect my business partners to be self-interested - but smartly so.
AID00126205	Attack me and you risk destroying the Chip.
AID00126206	By the time I was 30 years old, I was a billionaire 30 times over. I founded and ran a vast economic empire.
AID00126207	Do you really think I'm going to let an upstart come into my home and ransom my property to me?
AID00126208	I spent two centuries searching for the Platinum Chip. It's my invention, my property - mine. Now be a good courier and deliver it!
AID00126209	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
AID00126210	Hmm... How shall I put this?
AID00126211	Delivery of the Platinum Chip is non-negotiable.
AID00126212	I invite you to think carefully about what you do next... standing alone before me, surrounded by my heavily-armed Securitron guards.
AID00126213	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
AID00126214	Our terms were clear. Now that you have the Chip in your possession, any attempt to "re-negotiate" payment would be tantamount to blackmail.
AID00126215	I haven't talked to either Colonel Moore or Colonel Hsu yet.
AID00126216	Well then don't waste any more time here. Get going!
AID00126217	I received my orders from Colonel Hsu, and am still carrying them out.
AID00126218	I trust that Hsu will deal with the matter thoughtfully. Regardless, stay on your toes. There's no telling what will happen.
AID00126219	I received my orders from Colonel Moore, and am still carrying them out.
AID00126220	No doubt Colonel Moore's approach will produce results. Just be ready to duck when the bullets start flying.
AID00126221	I was hoping you'd know.
AID00126222	Damn it, I'm an ambassador, not a doctor. You'll have to find some other way.
AID00126223	I'm afraid I can't be much help in this matter. My specialty is people and politics, not medicine.
AID00126224	
AID00126225	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
AID00126226	It looks like you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to it.
AID00126227	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
AID00126228	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
AID00126229	Maybe the jet will cause his heart to give out.
AID00126230	I think I'd rather go with the assassination plan.
AID00126231	If that's what you prefer, I won't stop you. Just remember to try to find a way to do it that doesn't lead back to the NCR.
AID00126232	If it just doesn't look possible to make the kill without drawing attention, don't forget there's always the diplomatic approach.
AID00126233	Guess I'll go have a talk with the King, then.
AID00126234	I wish you luck. If you run into some difficulty and think you'd rather just take the shot with Pacer, that's fine too.
AID00126235	What would I need to do?
AID00126236	Go and talk to the King, try to convince him to put an end to this violence. Pacer's a punk, but he won't likely disobey a direct order.
AID00126237	The King might not be open to the idea at first, so you may have to ingratiate yourself with him. Do whatever it takes.
AID00126238	When it's done, one way or the other, report back here and we'll take it from there.
AID00126239	Tell me more about the King.
AID00126240	He's caucasian, in his mid-30s, and extremely charismatic. It's that last part that we're counting on.
AID00126241	The Kings are a bunch of young hoodlums who aren't inclined to listen to anyone, except him. Get him on our side, and the rest will fall in line.
AID00126242	VFSKingThanksPacer
AID00126243	We'll deal with that should the time come, Pace. Now I'm sure these gentlemen are as anxious to get out of here as we are to see them go.
AID00126244	It appears the Kings are a worthless pack of thugs. Sergeant, they're all yours.
AID00126245	We're dealing with the King, not you.
AID00126246	You're going to have to deal with me whether you like it or not. Get them!
AID00126247	
AID00126248	[SUCCEEDED] I... No. We would never survive. We need to stick together.
AID00126249	I'll go with whatever the King decides, but I'll be watching these NCR scumbags like a hawk. If they try anything...
AID00126250	So you'll fight him *and* the NCR? Can the Kings afford to fight each other?
AID00126251	[FAILED] No, I won't even consider this. We'll show the NCR they can't bully us!
AID00126252	Just shut up and do what your leader tells you!
AID00126253	I was afraid this would happen. Sergeant, you know what to do.
AID00126254	What the f-? Get the others! Now!
AID00126255	I think that's up to the King.
AID00126256	Not anymore it isn't. He's not in his right mind if he's even thinking about making a deal with this scum.
AID00126257	Pacer, I won't let you ruin this opportunity.
AID00126258	Let's see you stop me, then. Guys, let's teach these soldier boys a lesson.
AID00126259	VFSKing
AID00126260	VFSPacerSpeaksUp
AID00126261	I can't believe what I'm hearing. You're actually going to make a deal with these guys?
AID00126262	Pace, this is an opportunity we can't pass up. They're finally recognizing us. This is what we've been fighting for.
AID00126263	Like hell it is. This goes against everything we stand for. Everything you supposedly stand for.
AID00126264	I'm not going to listen to them just because they throw a few crumbs my way, and a lot of the guys feel the same way.
AID00126265	VFSPacerBetrays
AID00126266	And you. Bringing these assholes in here like you're doing us some kind of favor.
AID00126267	You can take your new friends and get the hell out of here, because the answer is no. The Kings will never deal with trash from the NCR.
AID00126268	No catch. You just make sure no King attack an NCR citizen from now on.
AID00126269	That's not so bad. I might have to make an example of a few of the more hotheaded guys, but otherwise, that sounds fair.
AID00126270	Tell you what. I'll agree to those terms. But the Kings won't lift a finger until we see the first of those supplies.
AID00126271	They're just here as an escort. Now do you want to hear their offer or not?
AID00126272	The Kings have to stop the violence against people from the NCR.
AID00126273	Hmmm, people around here *would* be a lot less ornery if there were more supplies to go around. It'd be rough at first, but I think we could manage.
AID00126274	Tell you what. I'll agree to those terms. But the Kings won't lift a finger until we see the first of those supplies.
AID00126275	You stop the attacks on NCR citizens, and your supply problems disappear.
AID00126276	Just hear them out. They're offering generous terms.
AID00126277	The NCR is willing to help supply Freeside in exchange for peace.
AID00126278	Freeside gets more food, water, and electricity.
AID00126279	That doesn't sound half bad... what's the catch?
AID00126280	What if they are?
AID00126281	Then I'm afraid we're going to have ourselves a tussle. Now say what you came to say or get out.
AID00126282	I can't give you these tapes, they are evidence of a crime.
AID00126283	I guess you've made your choice then. Time to die.
AID00126284	
AID00126285	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, give me the tapes and I'll leave.
AID00126286	I'm going a long way away from Vegas, but you better hope that you and I never see each other again.
AID00126287	I'll give you the tapes if you promise to leave Vegas and never come back, and give me 200 caps.
AID00126288	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no fucking way I'm going anywhere if those tapes aren't with me.
AID00126289	If you... um... give me 300 caps and leave Vegas, I'll keep these tapes safe.
AID00126290	VNelsonNelsonRangerMiloTopic000
AID00126291	I found the supplies you were looking for.
AID00126292	I take it my men were dead. It's a high price to pay, but these supplies will save a few lives here.
AID00126293	Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
AID00126294	Major Polatli sent me to help you out.
AID00126295	So the Major has you running errands for him. Well, we're short on personnel as well as supplies so we'll take all the help we can get.
AID00126296	Major Polatli said you might need some help.
AID00126297	With business booming like it is and considering I'm the only person with medical experience in the camp, I could perhaps use a hand.
AID00126298	Do you have any medical experience?
AID00126299	I don't have time for this.
AID00126300	I'll be here if you change your mind.
AID00126301	I could do that for you.
AID00126302	Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us of both.
AID00126303	Quartermaster Mayes has been complaining to me nonstop about the lack of supplies, but unfortunately we aren't getting a resupply any time soon.
AID00126304	I want you speak with him and see if there's anything you can do for him.
AID00126305	What do you need help with?
AID00126306	I'm short staffed and I don't have the time to take care of some issues around the camp.
AID00126307	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
AID00126308	I've got the Legion at Nelson breathing down my neck and not enough men or supplies to get this camp into fighting shape so we can strike back.
AID00126309	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
AID00126310	If I can get this place in order, then I can focus our efforts on taking back Nelson from the Legion.
AID00126311	And the more that gets done around here, the more resources I'll be able to put into assaulting Nelson.
AID00126312	Speaking of supplies... I found some nearby, are they yours?
AID00126313	Damn it all... I sent some men out to get these supplies, but they never returned. I guess the Legion got them on their way back.
AID00126314	At least we have the supplies. It's not much, but every little bit counts.
AID00126315	Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
AID00126316	Let's talk about that mission after all.
AID00126317	Legion?
AID00126318	What's the trouble with the Legion?
AID00126319	Hell, what ain't the trouble with the Legion? This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up
AID00126320	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
AID00126321	You're one of them "special" folks, ain't you? They ain't... real snakes, see? They're Legion soldiers.
AID00126322	I just called 'em snakes because they're low down and sneaky. Like a snake.
AID00126323	Anyway, we always have trouble with the Legion 'round here. This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up.
AID00126324	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
AID00126325	Do you have time for a few questions?
AID00126326	What's on your mind?
AID00126327	I'll be on my way. Goodbye.
AID00126328	What does the Platinum Chip do?
AID00126329	I'll make it up to you. What do we do next?
AID00126330	That all you've got, robot?
AID00126331	I will require a hardware and software upgrade to offer enhanced services.
AID00126332	No chatty games, Santiago. I don't have time for this.
AID00126333	Goodbye.
AID00126334	Goodbye.
AID00126335	VFSSantiagoHello2
AID00126336	Please leave me alone. I have nothing more to give.
AID00126337	If you want to make a go at it, I'll come along.
AID00126338	Why?
AID00126339	Nelson?
AID00126340	Fine, I'll do as you ask.
AID00126341	What's inside the hatch?
AID00126342	I'll do as you ask, Mr. House.
AID00126343	What's in it for me?
AID00126344	I'll go to the Fort as you ask.
AID00126345	Like I said, I'm not interested.
AID00126346	I'll give you time to think over the consequences of what you're saying. I urge you to reconsider.
AID00126347	I do have questions to ask.
AID00126348	I have some questions to ask.
AID00126349	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126350	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126351	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00126352	What's my stake in this?
AID00126353	All right, I'll do as you ask.
AID00126354	What's inside the hatch?
AID00126355	All right, I'll do as you ask.
AID00126356	What's my stake in this?
AID00126357	I'm not offering you an incentive as crude as money - though there'll be plenty of that.
AID00126358	What I'm offering you is a ground-floor opportunity in the most important enterprise on Earth.
AID00126359	What I'm offering is a future - for you, and for what remains of the human race.
AID00126360	James Garret is looking for a suave escort. Interested in some work?
AID00126361	I'm honored they would consider me. I'll start immediately.
AID00126362	What are you selling?
AID00126363	Have a look, baby.
AID00126364	No, not really.
AID00126365	Without any medical experience, you're not going to be much use to me in here.
AID00126366	However, you can take this status report back to Major Polatli. It's a very important task and I think I can count on you.
AID00126367	<Lie> You betcha!
AID00126368	Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
AID00126369	Since you have some medical experience, I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
AID00126370	Yes. I have some medical experience.
AID00126371	[SUCCEEDED] Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
AID00126372	Since you have some medical experience I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
AID00126373	I'll need some time to prepare.
AID00126374	Come back when you're ready.
AID00126375	I'm ready. Let's do it!
AID00126376	Excellent. Killing the Legion commanders in Nelson will severely cripple the Legion forces and allow us to take back the city.
AID00126377	Meet up with Sergeant Cooper just outside Nelson. He will assist you in reclaiming Nelson.
AID00126378	What do you want me to do now?
AID00126379	Well, with that over with and the Legion forces at Nelson defeated, we finally have some breathing room.
AID00126380	Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
AID00126381	With the help you've given us, we're doing a little bit better, but we still have the Legion forces at Nelson to deal with.
AID00126382	If we can retake Nelson, that will be a huge help to our efforts in this area and give us an advantage at Hoover Dam.
AID00126383	I've finished helping Dr. Richards.
AID00126384	I heard from Dr. Richards. Too bad you weren't able to help him with anything, but we all can't be doctors.
AID00126385	I heard from Dr. Richards and I wouldn't call what you did helping. We need all the men we can get on the frontline.
AID00126386	I heard from Dr. Richards. I'm glad you were at least some use to him.
AID00126387	Dr. Richards said you did a good job in there. That's mighty high praise coming from him.
AID00126388	I've helped Quartermaster Mayes get some supplies.
AID00126389	I heard. The extra supplies will help for a short time, but that only solves one of our problems.
AID00126390	With all the Legion raids lately, we're running low on troops that can still fight. Some are injured, but even more are dead.
AID00126391	I want you to check in with Dr. Richards and see if he needs any help getting our troops back on the front line.
AID00126392	I finished looking over your patients.
AID00126393	Excellent job. Where did you learn how to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
AID00126394	As for the men, they'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
AID00126395	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Once again, you have my sincerest thanks.
AID00126396	Not too bad, at least you didn't kill anyone.
AID00126397	They'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
AID00126398	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Thanks.
AID00126399	I'm looking for information.
AID00126400	Sorry, it's not my business to get involved.
AID00126401	Let me see what you have.
AID00126402	Here you go.
AID00126403	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
AID00126404	Is that so? That's a mighty tall order for someone I barely know. Now, if you were to help me out some, that might change my mind.
AID00126405	Can I help you with anything else?
AID00126406	I'd like to help you out, especially considering all you've done, but that's a pretty big favor you're asking for, and you've already used yours.
AID00126407	Was there anything else you wanted?
AID00126408	Well, if you can't do it...
AID00126409	Hold on now, I didn't say I couldn't do it, just that I couldn't guarantee it, and even that's probably stretching the truth a little.
AID00126410	Just leave everything to me. I'll see that the violence stops. But this makes us even, you hear?
AID00126411	The Kings will follow your leadership.
AID00126412	Damn straight they will. It's some of the other locals that I'm worried about.
AID00126413	On second thought, if I can whip this band of hooligans into obedience, a stray tough guy or two shouldn't be a problem.
AID00126414	Okay, you've got a deal. No more violence against the NCR on my watch. But this makes us even, you hear?
AID00126415	All I'm asking is that you try.
AID00126416	I'll give it my best. You've earned that much. But this makes us even, you hear?
AID00126417	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
AID00126418	Whoa... that's a doozy. Truth be told, I don't even know if I can pull something like that off.
AID00126419	I wanted to talk about something else.
AID00126420	Fine by me, just remember I owe you one. Now what did you want to talk about?
AID00126421	I'd like to think about it.
AID00126422	That's a good idea. I don't give out favors everyday, so you probably shouldn't rush to pick something.
AID00126423	Tumble it around in your mind and come back when you know what you want. I'll be here.
AID00126424	I could really use some money...
AID00126425	Caps are a little tight these days, but with our guards making more and those supplies comin' in I reckon I can spare some.
AID00126426	Can you get me into the Strip?
AID00126427	Sure can. I have a friend who has just what you're looking for, has a shop over yonder by the east gate, named Mick & Ralph's.
AID00126428	Just tell Ralph that I sent you and he'll get you squared away.
AID00126429	I want to join the Kings.
AID00126430	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, but I think I can make an exception in your case. I'll have one of the guys spread the word.
AID00126431	From this day forward, you're one of us, and no one in Freeside will mess with you if they know what's good for them.
AID00126432	In addition, if you want to do something about that hair of yours, talk to Sergio. I'll let him know you're coming.
AID00126433	Perhaps more importantly, you've earned the right to wear something a little more stylish. Here, wear it proudly.
AID00126434	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, and you'd be the first female King ever, but I think I can make an exception in your case.
AID00126435	From this day forward, you're one of us, and no one in Freeside will mess with you if they know what's good for them.
AID00126436	In addition, if you want to do something about that hair of yours, talk to Sergio. I'll let him know you're coming.
AID00126437	Perhaps more importantly, you've earned the right to wear something a little more stylish. Here, wear it proudly.
AID00126438	Keep it to yourself, but Hanlon is the one behind the misinformation. He's got a plan.
AID00126439	The Chief? But, he's a legend! I guess if he's got a plan behind it all, who am I to question it? I won't say a word about it to anyone else.
AID00126440	Can I join the Kings?
AID00126441	Whoa, there. Not just anyone can be a King. First of all, we usually only accept people native to the area.
AID00126442	Second, I have to approve. And I don't. You haven't shown me you've got what it takes to be a King yet.
AID00126443	But if you're fixin' to join something fierce, stick around, and if you play your cards right, things might change.
AID00126444	I have questions about something else.
AID00126445	What did you want to talk about?
AID00126446	You don't hate the Legion for what it did to your tribe?
AID00126447	We were savages. The Legion raised us up, made us better than what we were.
AID00126448	What happened to the rest of your tribe?
AID00126449	The girls and women were enslaved, and many of the men and boys were also chosen to become Legionaries. The rest were killed.
AID00126450	How did you end up joining the Legion?
AID00126451	When I was a boy, the Legion conquered my tribe. I was chosen for training as a Legionary.
AID00126452	I fought in many battles for the Legion. Eventually, Caesar chose me to lead his Praetorian Guard. It was a great honor.
AID00126453	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00126454	Very well.
AID00126455	I had some general questions for you.
AID00126456	I'll answer if I can.
AID00126457	Why do you want to know?
AID00126458	I ask because Caesar once had a similar pet, but it was lost during a battle.
AID00126459	<Lie> He just started following me one day. I have no idea where he came from.
AID00126460	I see. That's very strange.
AID00126461	Rex? I picked him up in New Vegas.
AID00126462	Oh? Such things are common in Denver, but I didn't know that other cities had them as well.
AID00126463	Have you ever met Caesar?
AID00126464	I haven't had the pleasure. I have crossed paths with Legate Lanius, his second-in-command, however. It was... unpleasant.
AID00126465	Don't worry - I won't tell on you if you don't tell on me.
AID00126466	Okay. Um... do you think you could help me?
AID00126467	< Speech - 50 >
AID00126468	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that's okay. Um, if you're a friend, can you help me?
AID00126469	I'm a friend. It's okay for you to talk to friends, right?
AID00126470	[FAILED] I'm not allowed to talk to you. Bye.
AID00126471	I just have some questions. It'll probably be okay to talk to me.
AID00126472	
AID00126473	<Talks about their reason behind visiting New Vegas>
AID00126474	<Talks about her home>
AID00126475	<Talks about Heck Gunderson>
AID00126476	<Talks about being a rancher>
AID00126477	<Talks about Walter's plans>
AID00126478	<Ethel's goodbyes>
AID00126479	So, 250 for Ted it is?
AID00126480	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00126481	Ted's worth 500 to you, then?
AID00126482	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00126483	Heck for 500, correct?
AID00126484	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00126485	We said 1000 for Heck, right?
AID00126486	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00126487	You might like to know that Heck's barely protected, right now.
AID00126488	So, Ted's nowhere to be found and Heck's quite unprotected while looking for him, huh?
AID00126489	Hell, it sounds like the perfect time to get even. Heck won't know what hit him, what do you say?
AID00126490	Let's talk prices.
AID00126491	I hear you. What's on your mind?
AID00126492	Consider it done.
AID00126493	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126494	Consider it done.
AID00126495	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126496	Consider it done.
AID00126497	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126498	Consider it done.
AID00126499	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126500	Consider it done.
AID00126501	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126502	Placeholder for good path in quest.
AID00126503	Kid, look around you, there's poison and death everywhere, and people like Heck are responsible for the misery we suffer.
AID00126504	What right do they have to continue with their mischief and killing, huh?
AID00126505	Heck's life? That's big game, a 1000 caps.
AID00126506	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00126507	Heck's life and a safe future have a steep price, Walter. 1000 caps' my fee.
AID00126508	[SUCCEEDED] I'll pay that much and die a happy man when my time comes. So, we got a deal?
AID00126509	Maybe Heck would listen to your pleas if his son's life was at stake.
AID00126510	A ransom? I doubt that snake's got enough soul to care that much for his own youngin. Besides, what's to stop him after his son's returned?
AID00126511	Nah, Heck only knows greed and pain, kid. It's high time he got paid back in kind. His life, or his son's, either way I win.
AID00126512	Yes.
AID00126513	No Vegas-banned items here, buddy. Just high quality standard stock.
AID00126514	No.
AID00126515	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, yes I do.
AID00126516	Follow me.
AID00126517	[FAILED] All of my guns are special. If anything catches your eye, let me know.
AID00126518	Do you have any special items for sale?
AID00126519	Why, do you work for one of the casinos?
AID00126520	Never mind.
AID00126521	Anything else you want?
AID00126522	<Pay 10 caps>
AID00126523	Don't get wise. We charge per use, so make that first drink worth the caps.
AID00126524	Can I buy bottled water?
AID00126525	Sure thing.
AID00126526	How much for a drink?
AID00126527	Just a few caps for a good long swig.
AID00126528	You already paid, bub. Get a drink then come back and see me if you still want more.
AID00126529	Why charge for water?
AID00126530	If we let everyone run amok, the damn NCR would shut us down. Gotta have some way to regulate usage.
AID00126531	VFSWaterPumpBark
AID00126532	The pump is property of The King. You'll need to pay if you want a drink.
AID00126533	<Lie> I wasn't able to find out anything.
AID00126534	That's too bad. These men really needed those supplies.
AID00126535	Thanks for looking into this, I appreciate it even though you didn't find anything.
AID00126536	No, not yet.
AID00126537	Let me know when you do find something out.
AID00126538	Yes. Private Stone was stealing them.
AID00126539	Is that so! I'll have to talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
AID00126540	I appreciate you doing this for me. Here's a little something for your trouble, it's not much, but it's all I can spare.
AID00126541	I wanted to talk to you about your missing medical supplies.
AID00126542	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing my medical supplies. You have my thanks.
AID00126543	Are you willing to look into this for me?
AID00126544	So you've found out what's happening with the supplies?
AID00126545	What would you like to know?
AID00126546	Seems easy enough.
AID00126547	It's easy. Just bring back any NCR dogtags you find and I'll try to make it worth your while.
AID00126548	I found some NCR dogtags.
AID00126549	Hey, you've been a big help. I wanted to give you something for helping me out. It's not much, but here you go.
AID00126550	Good work. If you find any more, you know where to find me.
AID00126551	Uh, no thanks, maybe later.
AID00126552	Suit yourself. Let me know if you change your mind.
AID00126553	It depends on what sort of thing.
AID00126554	I'm always willing to give a helping hand.
AID00126555	I want you to collect NCR dogtags from our fallen troopers. That way I can keep track of who's gone and how to reallocate our supplies.
AID00126556	About that thing you wanted...
AID00126557	Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to help me out with something real simple?
AID00126558	Tell me about yourself.
AID00126559	Me? I've been doing this shit for far too long and have been in too many battles to remember.
AID00126560	Still... this has got to be one of the worst situations I've been in. Not too much I can do about it but do my job and do it right.
AID00126561	How're things around the camp?
AID00126562	Not good. If we don't get more supplies, we're going to have to start using dirt for food and sticks and rocks for weapons.
AID00126563	Hey, how'd you like to do something for me?
AID00126564	Better now that all those Legion troops in Nelson are dead. The NCR might actually have a chance of kicking their asses after all.
AID00126565	Things are still pretty damn rough, but we're keeping it together.
AID00126566	<Speech>
AID00126567	[SUCCEEDED] I think you're right. I've been through worse. I'll go to the fort and see if the Followers can watch over me while I recover.
AID00126568	Jacob, be strong. You just need the support of your friends to get through this.
AID00126569	[FAILED] Get the hell out of here. Think you're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse or something?
AID00126570	Jacob, drugs are for the weak.
AID00126571	I've got the detox chems you need.
AID00126572	Thank God! I thought I was going to die if you didn't come back soon.
AID00126573	I'm going to head to the Followers' fort to get some rest and detox. You've saved my life, friend.
AID00126574	Thank God! I thought I was going to die if you didn't come back soon.
AID00126575	I'm going to head to the Followers' fort to get some rest and detox. You've saved my life, friend.
AID00126576	What was I supposed to do again?
AID00126577	Either kill Pacer in a way that doesn't lead back to us, or talk the King into quelling the violence. It's not really that hard to remember.
AID00126578	In any case, I expect to hear good news about this in the future. Keep me informed of your progress.
AID00126579	VFSVanGraffIntro01
AID00126580	Mr. Soren, please get to the point. The second half of your payment is late and I want to know why.
AID00126581	Ms. Van Graff, my associates and I have decided that we wish to renegotiate the terms of our deal.
AID00126582	Might I ask for what reason? The shipment was delivered. The guns were tested before leaving this facility.
AID00126583	Regardless, we feel that the quality of the weapons is below expectation, and hoped to adjust the price accordingly.
AID00126584	Ah, I think I understand what the issue here is. Excuse me for a moment, would you?
AID00126585	VFSVanGraffIntro05
AID00126586	Never break faith with the Van Graffs, Mr. Soren.
AID00126587	I expect you'll have the rest of our payment ready tomorrow morning.
AID00126588	VFSVanGraffIntro04
AID00126589	Do it.
AID00126590	VFSVanGraffIntro03
AID00126591	W-What is this, Ms. Van Graff?
AID00126592	This is a lesson, Mr. Soren. A lesson in faith.
AID00126593	I don't understand. Who is this man? What does this have to do with our deal?
AID00126594	VFSVanGraffIntro02
AID00126595	Jean-Baptiste, could you bring out the volunteer?
AID00126596	I always have what it takes.
AID00126597	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, confident. I like that.
AID00126598	So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
AID00126599	I... don't know, uh, what does it take?
AID00126600	[FAILED] Haha, not too bright, huh? It takes caps, honey, lots of them.
AID00126601	I just want to ask you some questions.
AID00126602	Goodbye.
AID00126603	<Placeholder for Joana's Question Node - JS>
AID00126604	All right, honey. What do you want to know?
AID00126605	I'd like to know more about you.
AID00126606	Yes?
AID00126607	I have questions about Gomorrah.
AID00126608	Yes?
AID00126609	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
AID00126610	You'd best hold your tongue... friend, or someone here will take care of it, for good.
AID00126611	What do you want to know about those sons of bitches?
AID00126612	<Placeholder for Joana's Goodbyes>
AID00126613	I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
AID00126614	Follow me, hon.
AID00126615	Follow me, hon.
AID00126616	Follow me, hon.
AID00126617	Okay. See you soon.
AID00126618	Follow me, hon.
AID00126619	I'll... I'm sure something good.
AID00126620	[FAILED] Honey, I've had better than just "good." And you were being so amusing...
AID00126621	Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
AID00126622	The better question is what are *you* going to do with it.
AID00126623	[SUCCEEDED] Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
AID00126624	Consider it "on the house," honey.
AID00126625	The better question is what are *you* going to do with it.
AID00126626	[SUCCEEDED] Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
AID00126627	Consider it "on the house," honey.
AID00126628	Lead the way.
AID00126629	Lead the way.
AID00126630	How does a 100 caps sound?
AID00126631	Fine. Are you ready?
AID00126632	How does 75 caps sound?
AID00126633	Well... ladies are always a welcome change.
AID00126634	Fine. Are you ready?
AID00126635	I am. Lead the way.
AID00126636	I am. Lead the way.
AID00126637	Actually, I'm short on caps right now.
AID00126638	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00126639	Actually, I'm short on caps right now.
AID00126640	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00126641	I have some questions.
AID00126642	Actually, let me ask you some questions.
AID00126643	I just have some questions for you.
AID00126644	What's your story?
AID00126645	Oh, nothing special, hon. I'm the best lay in Gomorrah, and that's all you need to know.
AID00126646	Do you like it here?
AID00126647	I like that you're here, doesn't that make you happy?
AID00126648	Let's talk about having fun.
AID00126649	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00126650	What's the deal with Gomorrah?
AID00126651	It's your paradise on this desolate earth, hon. Your troubles are gone, your pain forgotten, and your dreams come true.
AID00126652	Tell me about Gomorrah's clients.
AID00126653	Everyone wants a piece of their own personal heaven. So, they come here, for hours... and hours, hon.
AID00126654	Military men, NCR ranchers, wandering travelers... they're all the same without their clothes on. What they want, the Omertas provide.
AID00126655	I'm here for some fun.
AID00126656	So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
AID00126657	Yes?
AID00126658	So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
AID00126659	Consider it "on the house," honey.
AID00126660	Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
AID00126661	Look, I can't right now. I just want to leave this place and be with Carlitos.
AID00126662	I couldn't convince her to attempt a escape.
AID00126663	That won't do... at all. Listen, it can't be the jet, Cachino's got her scared shitless.
AID00126664	Find a way to make this work... please.
AID00126665	Joana's happy to hear from you and wants to escape Gomorrah.
AID00126666	She is...? Listen, no time to waste. Help her get to Freeside, that's our ticket out of this fucking city.
AID00126667	I'll meet you there between midnight and dawn, though we could use some backup. We only got one chance to get this right, you hear?
AID00126668	These guys in Freeside, good shots, right? They owe me big time. Tell'em that Carlitos' back to collect his chips, they'll know what do.
AID00126669	I'll be back when I convince her.
AID00126670	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00126671	
AID00126672	He's got his reasons. And when that man gets a notion stuck in his head, he's like a Bighorner bull that's seen red.
AID00126673	And if it means Heck Gunderson's involved, then you better step aside before the stampede tramples you over.
AID00126674	It's not my place to say much, Walter thinks this is a man's job. I swear, I won't see the day he'll get over that Heck Gunderson.
AID00126675	
AID00126676	Oh, a good ways west of here, in a place you've never been. Far as we concerned, only name it ever had was "Phebus Ranch."
AID00126677	That was before we lost some land to Heck Gunderson. The bank demanded payment in full the day after the Stockmen's Association bailed it out.
AID00126678	
AID00126679	If that's what you want to talk about, go see Walter. He'll talk your ear off.
AID00126680	Everything he says about the evils of Heck Gunderson is true, but I've never held the notion that fighting evil with evil carries the world forward.
AID00126681	I'm done talking about that man. If that's what you want, step on over to Walter.
AID00126682	
AID00126683	A good life if you don't mind hard work. The only real fuss is the constant bother with varmints.
AID00126684	Fail to catch Molerats early in their breeding, and you'll have three or four head breaking their ankles in Molerat holes every day.
AID00126685	Of course, the worst varmint at all is a Brahmin Baron with his hands in the pockets of a Republic senator.
AID00126686	That's a problem you can't solve with a Varmint Rifle, though I fear my husband's apt to try. He's got Heck Gunderson in his sights right now.
AID00126687	
AID00126688	All right, goodbye.
AID00126689	That's very kind of you. Maybe this'll be the dawn of a new day.
AID00126690	I'm not surprised. You don't see folks rushing to help each other around here.
AID00126691	What are you and he up to out here on the Strip?
AID00126692	Where are you from?
AID00126693	Goodbye.
AID00126694	Tell me again why the two of you came to the Strip.
AID00126695	What's so important about Heck Gunderson?
AID00126696	What's so important about Heck Gunderson?
AID00126697	Where are you from?
AID00126698	Where are you from?
AID00126699	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
AID00126700	Goodbye.
AID00126701	Goodbye.
AID00126702	What are you and he up to on the Strip?
AID00126703	Tell me again why the two of you came to the Strip.
AID00126704	Goodbye.
AID00126705	Where are you from?
AID00126706	Where are you from?
AID00126707	What are you and he up to on the Strip?
AID00126708	Tell me again what you and he are doing on the Strip?
AID00126709	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
AID00126710	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
AID00126711	Goodbye.
AID00126712	Goodbye.
AID00126713	What's the deal with this Heck Gunderson?
AID00126714	Goodbye.
AID00126715	
AID00126716	I don't suppose you have the magic powers necessary to bring my husband to his senses, do you?
AID00126717	He swears he won't leave this godforsaken city until he's seen Heck suffer. So far as I can see, we're the only ones in pain.
AID00126718	As I was saying, I'd be grateful if you could convince Walter to give up this doomed crusade of his.
AID00126719	I'll see what I can do.
AID00126720	If you can't talk him out of it, seems worthless for me to try.
AID00126721	Goodbye.
AID00126722	All right, I'll talk to him.
AID00126723	Maybe later.
AID00126724	Goodbye.
AID00126725	Is there some way I could help you out?
AID00126726	Is there some way I could help you out?
AID00126727	What's so important about this Heck Gunderson?
AID00126728	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
AID00126729	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
AID00126730	Ted's a goner.
AID00126731	Good work. I'm sorry that stupid mail-order cowboy ended like that but his father's misery makes it well worthy.
AID00126732	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00126733	You don't have to worry about Heck Gunderson, ever again.
AID00126734	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
AID00126735	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00126736	The Gundersons are history.
AID00126737	Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
AID00126738	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00126739	I have news about the Gundersons
AID00126740	Goodbye.
AID00126741	All right, kid! Be good.
AID00126742	Ethel's right, vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
AID00126743	None but...huh, what right do you have?
AID00126744	[FAILED] Same, the right of might, kid. The Gundersons will pay for all their crimes and that's final.
AID00126745	You are just giving them the excuse they need.
AID00126746	[SUCCEEDED] Hell, a good thrashing is what I want to give them but I see your point, kid. Things will never change without us good folks.
AID00126747	All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
AID00126748	Thanks for your help, kid. So long!
AID00126749	You are right. Let's deal with them.
AID00126750	Goodbye.
AID00126751	I'm not interested about this right now.
AID00126752	Nothing right now.
AID00126753	All right. At Gomorrah, the bar is always open.
AID00126754	Why is Caesar's Legion so... strange?
AID00126755	I used imperial Rome as the model for my Legion precisely because it was so foreign, so alien.
AID00126756	I'd seen what had become of the NCR's attempts to emulate the culture of Pre-War America - the in-fighting, the corruption.
AID00126757	Rome was a highly militarized autocracy that effectively integrated the foreign cultures it conquered.
AID00126758	It dedicated its citizens to something higher than themselves - to the idea of Rome itself.
AID00126759	In Rome I found a template for a society equal to the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world - a society that could and would survive.
AID00126760	A society that could prevent mankind from fracturing and destroying itself in this new world, by establishing a new Pax Romana.
AID00126761	It means a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogenous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers.
AID00126762	Long-term stability at all costs. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production.
AID00126763	What does "Pax Romana" mean?
AID00126764	No, I'll destroy it because it's inevitable that it be destroyed. It's Hegelian Dialectics, not personal animosity.
AID00126765	So you'll destroy the NCR because you hate its inefficiencies?
AID00126766	How do I put this basically enough? It's a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books.
AID00126767	The fundamental premise is to envision history as a sequence of "dialectical" conflicts. Each dialectic begins with a proposition, a thesis...
AID00126768	...which inherently contains, or creates, its opposite - an antithesis. Thesis and antithesis. The conflict is inevitable.
AID00126769	But the resolution of the conflict yields something new - a synthesis - eliminating the flaws in each, leaving behind common elements and ideas.
AID00126770	"Hegelian Dialectics?" What are those?
AID00126771	The bombs wiped the slate clean. Human civilization descended to a level of ignorance that effectively set our cultural progress back to zero.
AID00126772	The NCR has all of the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
AID00126773	Just as with the ancient Republic, it is natural that a military force should conquer and transform the NCR into a military dictatorship.
AID00126774	Thesis and antithesis. The Colorado River is my Rubicon. The NCR council will be eradicated, but the new synthesis will change the Legion as well...
AID00126775	...from a basically nomadic army to a standing military force that protects its citizens, and the power of its dictator.
AID00126776	So what's "dialectic" about you and the NCR?
AID00126777	How did you rise to power?
AID00126778	Ironically, I was born a Profligate myself, a citizen of the NCR.
AID00126779	My family lived not far from the great Boneyard. After Raiders killed my father, my mother sought the Followers' protection. I was two years old.
AID00126780	She found work at their Library, cooking and cleaning. I learned how to read and soon I was taking courses, free of charge.
AID00126781	Oh yes, raised in that tradition. And the teaching stuck. I was taught it was my responsibility to bring the torch of knowledge to the wastes.
AID00126782	I may have taken the torch part more literally than they intended.
AID00126783	You were a Follower of the Apocalypse?
AID00126784	When I was 20, the Followers sent me East to Grand Canyon. It was my first expedition, just me and a physician named Calhoun.
AID00126785	As an anthropologist and linguist, my assignment was to learn the dialects of the Grand Canyon tribes. What a fucking waste of time!
AID00126786	What changed you from a Follower to dictator?
AID00126787	If you think it's worthwhile to make smart people learn how to talk like backward savages, you're a Follower of the Apocalypse... or an idiot.
AID00126788	Anyway, we met up with a Mormon missionary who already knew a bunch of dialects - Joshua Graham. He was supposed to teach me.
AID00126789	But before that went too far, the Blackfoot tribe captured us, to hold us for ransom.
AID00126790	They were a backward bunch. But the real problem was, they didn't know how to fight.
AID00126791	Why would learning dialects be a waste of time?
AID00126792	The Blackfoot were at war with seven other tribes, each just as pissant as they were. But outnumbered like that, they weren't going to last long.
AID00126793	It's one thing to be taken hostage, another to be lashed to a sinking ship. So over Calhoun's objections, I decided to take certain steps.
AID00126794	What was wrong with the Blackfoot?
AID00126795	I taught them how to use the guns they already had - how to strip and clean them, how to breathe when pulling a trigger, how to reload ammunition.
AID00126796	They looked at me like I was some kind of a sorcerer. So I taught them how to make explosives, and started drilling them on small unit tactics.
AID00126797	If there's anything I learned as a Follower of the Apocalypse, it's that there's a lot of good information in old books.
AID00126798	What steps did you take?
AID00126799	Divide et impera - divide and conquer. I led the Blackfoot against the Ridgers, their weakest enemy.
AID00126800	When they refused to surrender, I ordered every man, woman, and child killed. When next we surrounded the Kaibabs and they likewise refused...
AID00126801	I took one of their envoys to the Ridgers' village and showed him the corpse piles.
AID00126802	This was new for the tribes, you see. They played at war, raiding each other, a little rape and pillage here, a little ransoming there.
AID00126803	I showed them total warfare. Like I said, there's a lot you can learn from old books.
AID00126804	What happened after you trained the Blackfoot?
AID00126805	The Kaibabs joined me, and the Fredonians after that - all the pissant tribes, with names that should be forgotten.
AID00126806	I knew from the start I'd need to eradicate this plague of tribal identities, replacing them with a monolithic culture, a uniform identity.
AID00126807	So that's what I did, once my confederation of tribes was large enough. I crowned myself Caesar and created a single Great Tribe - my Legion.
AID00126808	I sent Calhoun, the Follower captured with me, back West with a message that I should not be interfered with.
AID00126809	Joshua Graham, the Mormon interpreter, stayed with me and served as my first Legatus.
AID00126810	What happened to the tribes?
AID00126811	That's right. Decades of warfare, absorbing lesser tribes, gathering power. Forging the dross into a vast, razor-sharp scythe.
AID00126812	My Legion's expansion has never ceased. Much of the Utah and Colorado, and all of Arizona and New Mexico, are mine.
AID00126813	We have cities of our own, but nothing compared to Vegas. Finally, my Legion will have its Rome.
AID00126814	And since forming the Legion, all you've done is conquer other tribes?
AID00126815	What role will regional powers play in the conflict?
AID00126816	I've analyzed the region's tribes to determine how they might be useful. I may tell you more at a later time, if it suits me.
AID00126817	Here, this document has clear instructions on what to do next.
AID00126818	Here, these written orders make it plain.
AID00126819	These written orders will tell you what to do next.
AID00126820	See Vulpes for details about your next mission.
AID00126821	For further instructions, see Vulpes.
AID00126822	Go see Vulpes. He'll brief you.
AID00126823	Go see Lucius for details about your next mission.
AID00126824	For further instructions, see Lucius.
AID00126825	Go see Lucius. He'll brief you.
AID00126826	What do you know about Mr. House?
AID00126827	I know he's a coward, hiding behind an army of robots, ensconced in that tower of his like a wizard in one of those Grognak comic books.
AID00126828	Some say he's a man, others, a machine. I don't care. He's in the way.
AID00126829	I know he's dead. I know he's no longer a factor. That's all I need to know.
AID00126830	Losers don't matter in the history books. He's a fucking footnote.
AID00126831	What did you know about Mr. House?
AID00126832	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00126833	Do you want my opinion as a former citizen, or future conqueror? Actually, my opinion's the same either way.
AID00126834	As a young man I was taught to venerate President Tandi of Shady Sands. "The Founding Mother of the New California Republic."
AID00126835	Did you know her Presidency lasted 52 years? And that her father, Aradesh, was the Republic's first President?
AID00126836	Does that sound like democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
AID00126837	Because the council didn't dare oppose her. She was too popular. She had the people's love.
AID00126838	So things ran smoothly, more or less. And as soon as she was gone, as soon as there really could be "democracy" - what happened then?
AID00126839	Ever since losing its queen, the NCR has been weaker, more diffuse. Democracy has been its weakness, not its strength.
AID00126840	President Tandi was voted into office each time.
AID00126841	Greed runs rampant. The government is corrupt, accepting bribes from Brahmin barons and landowners, to the detriment of citizens.
AID00126842	The NCR is a loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves. It's lost virtue. No one cares about the collective, the greater good.
AID00126843	It's not built to last. I'm just hastening the inevitable.
AID00126844	How is the NCR weak?
AID00126845	Of course. The most powerful my Legion has faced. Also the first to which I am ideologically opposed.
AID00126846	Until now, every tribe I've conquered has been so backwards and stunted, enslavement has been a gift bestowed upon them.
AID00126847	My conquest of the Mojave will be a glorious triumph, marking the transition of the Legion from a basically nomadic tribe to a genuine empire.
AID00126848	Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul before he crossed the Rubicon, so have I campaigned, and will cross the Colorado.
AID00126849	Surely, the NCR is a powerful foe?
AID00126850	How did you capture Benny?
AID00126851	I'll hand it to that piece of shit, he was determined. He used some kind of Old-World stealth device to get across the river in a Legion boat.
AID00126852	Seems the device ran out of juice once he got here, but he was dressed like a Legionary. He was caught just outside the weather station.
AID00126853	See, thing is, he didn't change his hairstyle. To go through all that effort and fail because you're too vain to muss your hair...
AID00126854	He was brought before me, along with the Platinum Chip. That's how I knew he wasn't some kind of Profligate infiltrator.
AID00126855	Benny tried to sell me a story, but Lucius has a way coaxing the truth out of captives. Everything just comes spilling out.
AID00126856	What happened after Benny was caught?
AID00126857	What do you know of the White Glove Society?
AID00126858	There were tales once, of a cannibal tribe near Vegas, one that hid itself in a cavern far below ground, hunting men as prey above.
AID00126859	The scouts I occasionally sent west many years ago reported these tales, but never had contact. Well, except the ones who went missing, perhaps.
AID00126860	There are rumors that the White Gloves might be this lost tribe. Maybe you can help them find themselves.
AID00126861	Culture is an odd thing. Sometimes a tribe grows tired of its identity, grabs for an opportunity to reimagine itself.
AID00126862	The tribe becomes its own antithesis. Everything flips to the opposite polarity.
AID00126863	Dialectics tells us that this can't last. There has to be a synthesis, a final sorting out.
AID00126864	How could savage cannibals run the Ultra-Luxe?
AID00126865	Got any advice to share?
AID00126866	Feed a man for free, and he'll be back asking for more.
AID00126867	Feed a man a bullet. You won't hear from him again.
AID00126868	Good, bad... The guy with the gun makes the rules.
AID00126869	Time you enjoy wasting isn抰 wasted time.
AID00126870	The only thing I know for certain is that I don抰 know nothing.
AID00126871	Longing makes the heart grow fonder, but I抳e always been a fan of hog-tying my lovers to make sure they can抰 escape.
AID00126872	<Barter>
AID00126873	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking. I suppose I could sleaze it up a bit for their customers if it means I have a non-stop supply of drink.
AID00126874	Tell the Garrets I'm in. I'll make my way there shortly.
AID00126875	One of the employee perks is a discount...
AID00126876	[FAILED] I don't need caps that bad. A hard day's labor pays well enough.
AID00126877	Caps are caps, honey. You can't be picky about how you make them!
AID00126878	You could be the next big thing at the Wrangler.
AID00126879	I've never been much of a showboat, or cared about being a public figure. I'm plenty content with caps for an honest hard day's work.
AID00126880	Let's talk about something else.
AID00126881	What do you have in mind?
AID00126882	So, who are you?
AID00126883	I've been around a while. Currently working for the Followers as a gun for hire, but it's getting rather dull.
AID00126884	Aside from protecting them from the occasional thug looking to intercept supply shipments, there isn't much to do around here.
AID00126885	The one researcher I liked who I could chat up about liquor got transferred, and the rest of the docs are pretty uptight about my kind of fun.
AID00126886	I have some questions.
AID00126887	And I may have answers.
AID00126888	What are you doing with the Followers?
AID00126889	I joined up looking for a decent-paying job. Granted, the pay is all right, but they won't let me kick back and slog a brew at the end of the day.
AID00126890	They're worried the filthy drunkies in detox seeing me drink will cause an immediate relapse. I say their rehab effort here is just a revolving door.
AID00126891	I bet you've seen a lot over the years.
AID00126892	I've been around long enough to observe patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
AID00126893	I'm in the market for something a little unusual.
AID00126894	I'm available, sweetie - but you'll have to do as I say.
AID00126895	Then you'll need to get a room first, sweetie. You're going to want the privacy.
AID00126896	Sounds good to me. <Pay 25 caps.>
AID00126897	Meet me upstairs. I'll try to leave you in one piece.
AID00126898	Maybe another time.
AID00126899	Suit yourself. Anything else on your mind?
AID00126900	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
AID00126901	Santiago is here to please, my prarie flower. Just a few caps and I'm yours.
AID00126902	Santiago is sorry, but you must have a room first. Please see Ms. Garret to procure lodging.
AID00126903	Here you go. <Pay 25 caps>
AID00126904	I'll meet you upstairs in a moment, darling.
AID00126905	The Followers are looking to work out a supply deal.
AID00126906	Are they looking to buy guns?
AID00126907	No.
AID00126908	Then talk to my partner Ralph.
AID00126909	The Followers are looking to set up a supply deal.
AID00126910	We don't have the stills and equipment to supply the amount of meds they're looking to purchase.
AID00126911	You could check with other wasteland merchants, but I think your best bet would be the Atomic Wrangler.
AID00126912	They've got a bunch of stills and a seemingly endless supply of grain alcohol, which could be used as anesthetic or disinfectant.
AID00126913	Seems like you need a steady supply, not just whatever I can grab for you.
AID00126914	So far the Crimson Caravan won't cut us a deal. If you can convince them or some other merchant to work with us, I'll discount supplies to you.
AID00126915	Which merchants might be willing to make a deal?
AID00126916	You might ask around at Mick and Ralph's - or go see the Garrets, though I suspect they're too busy poisoning Freeside to help it out.
AID00126917	A regular shipment of supplies is what you need here.
AID00126918	That would be a godsend, but so far we've had no luck working out a deal with the Crimson Caravan or any other local merchants.
AID00126919	If you could manage to find someone willing to work with us, I'd gladly offer medical supplies at a discount.
AID00126920	I have some medical supplies to drop off.
AID00126921	Great! What do you have?
AID00126922	Good to hear! Oh, by the way. I got a shipment of magazines from home I'd be willing to sell if you're interested.
AID00126923	It looks like you took care of our short term supply issues. In thanks, you can have a discount on medical services with me.
AID00126924	Also, I would like to extend an invitation to join the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00126925	Your work here in the Old Mormon Fort has been invaluable, and I can't think of a more worthy recruit. Will you join us?
AID00126926	Good to hear! What do you have to donate?
AID00126927	Med-X
AID00126928	It looks like we've got enough Med-X for the moment, but it always helps to be prepared with a backup supply. How much do you have to donate?
AID00126929	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126930	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126931	Rad-Away
AID00126932	We have a good stock of Rad-Away at this point, but every extra bit helps. How much do you have to donate?
AID00126933	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126934	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126935	Fixer
AID00126936	With your help, we now have a small overstock of Fixer, however, it never hurts to have extra. How much do you have to donate?
AID00126937	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126938	How much do you have to donate?
AID00126939	Never mind.
AID00126940	One.
AID00126941	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126942	Two.
AID00126943	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126944	Three.
AID00126945	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126946	One.
AID00126947	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126948	Two.
AID00126949	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126950	Three.
AID00126951	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126952	One.
AID00126953	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126954	Two.
AID00126955	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126956	Three.
AID00126957	Thanks! Anything else?
AID00126958	That is all for now.
AID00126959	Thanks for the donation. Every bit goes toward helping Freeside.
AID00126960	They just need tech support and raw materials.
AID00126961	The Garrets should be sending over supplies shortly.
AID00126962	I'm honestly pleasantly surprised they would help us out, but I can see Garret isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
AID00126963	Well, it looks like you've earned yourself a discount on supplies now that we'll be fully covered. This supply deal will aid our work immensely.
AID00126964	Do you sell medical supplies?
AID00126965	We're pretty short-handed as it is, but I suppose I could spare a few items.
AID00126966	I'd like to buy medical supplies.
AID00126967	We don't have a lot right now, but this is what I can offer for sale.
AID00126968	Here is what we have available.
AID00126969	So, you want me to talk to Carlitos?
AID00126970	I've talked to Carlitos, but not about you.
AID00126971	I know Carlitos.
AID00126972	I expect something in return.
AID00126973	I'll talk to him for you.
AID00126974	So, you want me to talk to Carlitos?
AID00126975	If you meet him, anywhere... I'd do anything to get him back and escape this hell, although I'm not keeping my hopes up.
AID00126976	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AID00126977	Yes?
AID00126978	I expect something in return.
AID00126979	All right. I'll talk to him.
AID00126980	I've talked to Carlitos, but not about you.
AID00126981	What? Carlitos is alive? Please, tell him that I still love him, that I want to escape with him... please.
AID00126982	Tell me about your problem.
AID00126983	I want to ask you something else.
AID00126984	Carlitos wants to get you out of here.
AID00126985	You know what I want, Joana.
AID00126986	Yes... I know what you want. And I know how to give it to you, right now.
AID00126987	200 caps would do, for now.
AID00126988	That sounds good, hon. I hope to see you soon.
AID00126989	Nothing, I'll find him for you.
AID00126990	What? Are you... serious? Well, I'm not complaining, hon.
AID00126991	Thank you so much for your help.
AID00126992	Anything...
AID00126993	Hon, nobody's given me a free thing before. What's it going to be for you, caps, sex, straps, what?
AID00126994	What can you tell me about the Omertas.
AID00126995	I have questions about Gomorrah.
AID00126996	I'd like to know more about you.
AID00126997	If he lives, I'll find him for you.
AID00126998	What if Carlitos lives?
AID00126999	If he's alive he's long gone. The Omertas want him dead, now.
AID00127000	If you meet him, anywhere... I'd do anything to get him back and escape this hell, although I'm not keeping my hopes up.
AID00127001	Sorry, I'm not interested in this right now.
AID00127002	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00127003	I know Carlitos.
AID00127004	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
AID00127005	Cachino talked because Carlitos broke Omerta rules?
AID00127006	Cachino doesn't give a shit about rules, only cares to feed his perversions. He lusted for me, he's done things to me.
AID00127007	Look... I'm stuck here, I know that. Carlitos is the only thing that kept me going, and now I don't have anything left.
AID00127008	What's Carlitos' story?
AID00127009	He was an Omerta that... fell in love with me. They don't ever mix with people outside the "family," you know?
AID00127010	He was planning to escape with me but Cachino found out about us. So he did something, talked, I don't know, and Carlitos disappeared.
AID00127011	Goodbye.
AID00127012	Tell me about Cachino.
AID00127013	Tell me about the Omertas.
AID00127014	What's happened to you?
AID00127015	I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
AID00127016	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
AID00127017	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
AID00127018	As I told you, Carlitos was the only thing that kept me alive in this place. Now, I just don't know what'll happen.
AID00127019	What's the deal with Cachino?
AID00127020	He's a filthy monster. I've been with perverted men but Cachino's done things... to me, that -
AID00127021	Even other Omertas would also want to kill him if they knew what he does. He's broken so many of their rules that I don't know how he still breathes.
AID00127022	Consider it done.
AID00127023	You'll just have to hope it all works out... I guess.
AID00127024	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't risk our lives without more guarantees than that.
AID00127025	I have other questions for you.
AID00127026	Don't worry, I'll tell him that you are happy to hear from him.
AID00127027	Thank you so much for your help.
AID00127028	You'll never see them again, you have my word.
AID00127029	[SUCCEEDED] To be free and with Carlitos again... Tell him that I still, I - never mind.
AID00127030	Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
AID00127031	I had other questions first.
AID00127032	I... don't know, but we'll figure it out.
AID00127033	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't risk our lives without more guarantees than that.
AID00127034	Trust me, I'll keep you safe.
AID00127035	[SUCCEEDED] You sound so sure. Damn it all, you better not make me regret this later.
AID00127036	But the Omertas will want us dead. What are we going to do about that?
AID00127037	Let me ask you something else.
AID00127038	All right. Lead the way.
AID00127039	Contracted pupils, involuntary spasms... Med-X kills quickly, Joana. I can help.
AID00127040	[SUCCEEDED] I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
AID00127041	I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
AID00127042	[SUCCEEDED] I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
AID00127043	You don't look good. Are you... ill or something?
AID00127044	[FAILED] I'm not, but questions bore me, hon.
AID00127045	Joana, you can trust me. Why are you avoiding my questions?
AID00127046	[SUCCEEDED] I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
AID00127047	[SUCCEEDED] I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
AID00127048	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
AID00127049	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
AID00127050	You keep avoiding my questions. Are you bothered by them?
AID00127051	[FAILED] I'm not, but questions bore me, hon.
AID00127052	Goodbye.
AID00127053	I want to talk about something else.
AID00127054	Okay, what's on your mind?
AID00127055	Carlitos wants to get you out of here.
AID00127056	I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
AID00127057	He... does? Wait, this changes everything. I can't leave my girls here... and, where would we go even if we escape?
AID00127058	No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
AID00127059	No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
AID00127060	But the Omertas will want us dead. What are we going to do about that?
AID00127061	Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
AID00127062	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AID00127063	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
AID00127064	Yes?
AID00127065	Tell me about their leaders.
AID00127066	Goodbye.
AID00127067	Tell me about their leaders.
AID00127068	Nero's the pack leader and Big Sal's his right hand. What Nero wants, Big Sal does. Then there's... Cachino.
AID00127069	What's the Omertas' role in Gomorrah?
AID00127070	They run the place as a center for all their dirty scams and extortions. Gambling, sex, drugs, they'll use whatever works to exploit your weaknesses.
AID00127071	Hooker, customer, it doesn't matter. Everyone here's a pawn to the Omertas, playing and dying by their rules.
AID00127072	Tell me about the Omertas.
AID00127073	I'm busy now.
AID00127074	Yeah, sure fucking thing. I'll be waiting with baited breath for your schedule to clear up, ha ha.
AID00127075	What would I have to do?
AID00127076	No, no, no. That's not how it works. You don't get to weigh the options. You're either in or you're out.
AID00127077	Absolutely.
AID00127078	All right then. If we're going to work together, there's only one thing you need to know about me. I like things simple.
AID00127079	Recently Glory negotiated a deal between us and a big time player. We're talking more caps than you'd probably see in a lifetime.
AID00127080	Your part in this is simple. To finalize this deal, I need to tie up a loose end. To do that, there's a girl I need you to find.
AID00127081	They seemed pleased, and said they'd be in touch.
AID00127082	What do you know about this client?
AID00127083	It's better if you don't ask. Now I believe I asked you a question. What was their reaction?
AID00127084	He said you'd hear from them soon.
AID00127085	Good... good. Here's your payment. If you'll excuse me, I have some thinking to do.
AID00127086	Oh, Jean-Baptiste was talking about a matter earlier that he needs help with. I volunteered you. See him for the details.
AID00127087	I'm not a delivery boy. Not interested.
AID00127088	Very well. Let me know if you change your mind. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while, so there's no rush.
AID00127089	My men have their hands full with our other operations, so unless I can find another courier, the job will still be available.
AID00127090	I'll do it.
AID00127091	Good, here's the package. I'll mark the location on your map. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while so there's no rush.
AID00127092	That said, try not to dawdle. This client could mean big money for us, which naturally means big money for you.
AID00127093	Keep talking.
AID00127094	Maybe another time.
AID00127095	Well, look who doesn't need my money any more. When you find your pockets a little lighter, stop back.
AID00127096	It's a courier job, so it should be easy caps.
AID00127097	Always.
AID00127098	There's a deal that we've been working on for a while now and the buyer would like a sample of our weapons.
AID00127099	I need you to run a package out to a discrete location that the client has chosen. Sound good?
AID00127100	
AID00127101	Unfortunately, I found someone else with a little more experience, and he'll take over the position starting tomorrow.
AID00127102	However, another task has come up that I could use some help with, assuming you're still interested in making some money?
AID00127103	You basically let every jackass off the street march in here. That doesn't say much for your judgement.
AID00127104	Still, you did manage to prevent that psychopath from blowing this place up. That deserves some reward, at least.
AID00127105	Then you robbed me of my revenge on that prancing asshole of a King. For that alone, I should kill you.
AID00127106	You kept away the undesirables, patted down the rest for weapons, and kept your cool.
AID00127107	That is to say, you performed as instructed. Simon was impressed, and so am I. So you get a small bonus with your normal pay.
AID00127108	You had a little bit of a hard time following instructions, but didn't do too bad overall. Here's your pay.
AID00127109	VFSSimonCallsItADay
AID00127110	It's just about closing time. Let's go see the boss about getting paid.
AID00127111	Oh, I'm going to need the rifle and armor back. Boss's orders.
AID00127112	VFSSimonTellsYouToLookAround
AID00127113	Good. Look around and get a feel for where customers and risks can enter and exit the area while I get your gear ready.
AID00127114	What's the difference?
AID00127115	Lasers have a high rate of fire, but not a lot of stopping power. Plasma on the other hand is slow as a mule, but with a kick to match.
AID00127116	So what'll it be?
AID00127117	Plasma.
AID00127118	Nothing wrong with going plasma. Just make sure you hit what you're aiming at.
AID00127119	Laser.
AID00127120	Good choice. I prefer laser-based weapons myself, but the boss lady said she wants at least one guard using a plasma rifle.
AID00127121	Says the lightning bits draw in more people. Whatever.
AID00127122	Now that you're equipped, a quick word on the job at hand. In a nutshell, we're here to keep the riff-raff away.
AID00127123	Drunks, punks, and capless vermin are to be turned away. Potential customers are to be permitted normal entrance.
AID00127124	That is, after we pat them down for weapons. An unarmed man is a lot less likely to try to steal something with several armed guards around.
AID00127125	Don't start any fights. I don't care if some Jet junkie just insulted your mother, we're here to promote violence elsewhere, not start it here.
AID00127126	Lastly, don't abandon your post. We're getting paid to stand next to this door, not talk to someone down the street or head to the casino.
AID00127127	That goes double for any thoughts of splitting with that gear. Every now and then some young punk thinks he can run off with Van Graff property.
AID00127128	Trust me, the rifle and armor are nice, but they're not worth your life.
AID00127129	Other than that, relax. There's usually some eye candy coming and going from the Wrangler over there at some point, so the view's not too bad.
AID00127130	Other than that, relax. Who knows, you might attract a high roller from the Wrangler over there and never have to pull a gig like this again!
AID00127131	Looks like we're stuck with each other.
AID00127132	I've been paired with worse, I guess. Anyway, let's see if you can follow instructions.
AID00127133	How did you know?
AID00127134	You can always tell a rookie. You look too eager. Give the job a few hours, and the shine'll come right off.
AID00127135	That's right.
AID00127136	Well, no time for pleasantries. I've got your gear right here, but let's see if you can follow instructions.
AID00127137	You'll be covering the other side of the door there. Take your position while I get your stuff out.
AID00127138	Tell me about yourself.
AID00127139	Oh, there's not much to tell. I was born into a big family and don't get along with my parents, so here I am. As far away from them as possible.
AID00127140	Tell me about Freeside.
AID00127141	This place is certainly lively, that's for sure. Did you want to know something specific about it?
AID00127142	This seems like a bad neighborhood to open a store.
AID00127143	Look around, and you'll notice two things.
AID00127144	First, we don't lack for security. I'm not worried about anyone breaking in here or stealing our goods.
AID00127145	Not that we don't occasionally have attempts, but even those prove useful. Do you know how much target dummies cost?
AID00127146	Back to my point, the second thing you'll notice is that we do not sell cheap merchandise. Everything here is second-to-none.
AID00127147	People who buy Van Graff goods typically don't care where they have to go to get them.
AID00127148	What do you sell?
AID00127149	So is this a family business?
AID00127150	Yes it is. My brother and I run this particular branch, but our family has operations all over, particularly in California.
AID00127151	Mind if I ask you some questions?
AID00127152	Not at all.
AID00127153	Sorry, I have better things to do.
AID00127154	Suit yourself. Was there anything else you wanted?
AID00127155	Sure. Count me in.
AID00127156	Wonderful. I already have a man outside who can show you the ropes and get you set up. His name is Simon.
AID00127157	He's been with the family for years, so listen to what he says, and follow his instructions.
AID00127158	
AID00127159	It just so happens a position opened up recently. It's not much, but it'll be a good way for me to gauge your potential for future assignments.
AID00127160	I was wondering if you had any work available.
AID00127161	It just so happens a position opened up recently. We currently need another body to guard the entrance outside. Think you can handle that?
AID00127162	I was wondering if you had any work available.
AID00127163	Ran out of caps, eh? The job's still available, if you're interested.
AID00127164	Is that guard position still available?
AID00127165	You're in luck. We've interviewed a few people for the courier position, but they all seem so... untrustworthy. Ready to make some money?
AID00127166	Still need that sample delivered?
AID00127167	And? Don't leave me in suspense. What was their reaction?
AID00127168	I delivered the package as requested.
AID00127169	VFSGloriaTalksAboutVolunteer
AID00127170	Everything. Up until recently, this man was an employee of mine. He's quite handsome, don't you think?
AID00127171	I know I did. We became... close. I warned him that I was a very jealous woman, and he said he understood.
AID00127172	Apparently he didn't. Last week, I chanced upon him in Gomorrah, being serviced by one of their two-cap whores. I was not pleased.
AID00127173	I tell you all this because I want you to know that this man means a great deal to me.
AID00127174	VFSVanGraffLaughter
AID00127175	Okay everyone, show's over. Back to work!
AID00127176	
AID00127177	Ha ha, I think he wet himself before he left. That was pretty good making up that part about sleeping with Jacob.
AID00127178	You did make that part up, right, Glory?
AID00127179	Damn it, girl, what has mama always said about tipping the help? I thought this was about him stealing money from us.
AID00127180	He was stealing money, though he could have kept it for all I cared. God knows he earned it.
AID00127181	ChallengePlayer
AID00127182	An outsider! In the bunker!
AID00127183	Imposter!
AID00127184	How did the NCR defeat the Legion at Hoover Dam before?
AID00127185	We had the numbers, but not the tactics. I know - I was there at Boulder City when we were defeated.
AID00127186	We relied too much on veteran Legionaries for direction and leadership, and the Rangers exploited our weakness by killing our best from afar.
AID00127187	What do you think about the NCR?
AID00127188	The NCR Rangers are the biggest threat. Without them, the NCR is nothing.
AID00127189	I want to talk about something else.
AID00127190	Okay then, what would you like to talk about?
AID00127191	I can't help you right now.
AID00127192	Perhaps you can come back and help me when you have more time.
AID00127193	When did you notice them missing?
AID00127194	I remember coming in one morning and noticing that my supplies were lower than they should have been.
AID00127195	I thought it might have been a mistake, but another morning I noticed the same thing.
AID00127196	The camp is pretty dead at night, especially at 0200 hours when the guard shift changes. That'd be a good place to start looking.
AID00127197	Where do you keep your supplies?
AID00127198	Locked in a cabinet, here in the medical tent. I'm around most of the time, but I can't keep a constant watch on them.
AID00127199	What exactly is missing?
AID00127200	I store a variety of drugs here, but it looks like my supply of Hydra is diminishing rather quickly.
AID00127201	I can look into this for you.
AID00127202	That would definitely be appreciated. You might want to ask around and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
AID00127203	It wasn't me.
AID00127204	That's an odd response if I've ever heard one.
AID00127205	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AID00127206	Maybe you're just careless.
AID00127207	I may have my hands full here, but I'm anything but careless.
AID00127208	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AID00127209	Perhaps you've misplaced them?
AID00127210	Anything is possible, but that's unlikely.
AID00127211	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AID00127212	What makes you think someone is stealing your supplies?
AID00127213	The simple fact that I no longer have as many supplies as I should. I've been careful with them and I should have more than what remains.
AID00127214	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
AID00127215	This place looks more like a chop shop.
AID00127216	Sometimes it does feel that way. I feel more like a mortician than a doctor.
AID00127217	Often I just don't have the resources to handle the number of injuries here.
AID00127218	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
AID00127219	You seem to be handling it well.
AID00127220	I'm doing the best I can considering the poor situation I find myself in.
AID00127221	There's barely enough equipment or medicine to handle the number of injuries we have.
AID00127222	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
AID00127223	It looks like you have a decent facility here.
AID00127224	Someone with medical experience, I take it? It's not the best, but it does the job.
AID00127225	I just wish I had the equipment and supplies to handle the number of injuries we have here.
AID00127226	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
AID00127227	Things look pretty rough in here.
AID00127228	Men have waged war on each other for countless centuries. Now is no different.
AID00127229	People fight and die for what they believe in. I'm just here to patch them up so they can go on their merry way. Do no harm and all that.
AID00127230	I have some questions for you.
AID00127231	What would you like to know?
AID00127232	Nevermind. I'll just turn you in instead.
AID00127233	Not interested.
AID00127234	Fine. Be like that.
AID00127235	Alright, hand it over.
AID00127236	Here you go. Thanks, I owe you big time.
AID00127237	What's your problem?
AID00127238	My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
AID00127239	The Legion may be gone from Nelson, but there's still a whole fucking army of them out there.
AID00127240	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die in this war.
AID00127241	So why don't you just leave me alone.
AID00127242	My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
AID00127243	We're out of food, we're out of men, and we're out of time. The Legion is right outside waiting to kill us all.
AID00127244	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die here.
AID00127245	So why don't you just leave me alone.
AID00127246	Because it's the right thing to do.
AID00127247	[FAILED] No. That's not going to happen.
AID00127248	If you promise to stop, I won't turn you in.
AID00127249	What? Hey sure! You got a deal. Thanks, I owe you big time.
AID00127250	I won't turn you in... if you make it worth my while.
AID00127251	Alright. Here, I'll give you some of what I stole, just don't mention this to anyone.
AID00127252	I want you to turn yourself in.
AID00127253	What? You want me to turn myself in?
AID00127254	Why the hell should I do that?
AID00127255	I'm going to turn you in.
AID00127256	Haven't you heard anything I've said?! Don't you understand?!
AID00127257	Hey, maybe I can change your mind. I still have some drugs left over. They're all yours if you let me go.
AID00127258	That's a poor excuse.
AID00127259	I knew you wouldn't understand! You haven't been here! You haven't been through all the horrors that we go through every day!
AID00127260	So what are you going to do about it?
AID00127261	Hum... I think I understand.
AID00127262	Yeah, see... I just needed to escape for a little while. To not think about all this stuff going on here.
AID00127263	So what happens now?
AID00127264	What about the injured men that need this medicine?
AID00127265	I... uh... I never... I never thought about that.
AID00127266	But look, I needed this. I needed to escape for just a little while. I needed this...
AID00127267	So what happens now?
AID00127268	Doing drugs isn't going to change anything.
AID00127269	But it sure as hell is going to make me feel better for a little while, and that's all I wanted.
AID00127270	So what happens now?
AID00127271	I don't care about your explanations.
AID00127272	Hey look, I just wanted to forget about all this stuff happening around here for a little while, that's all!
AID00127273	What happens now?
AID00127274	This better be good.
AID00127275	Have you looked around? Have you seen what's going on here? What we're going through?
AID00127276	This place is hell. I've seen my all my friends butchered by the Legion in front of my very eyes. I can still hear their screams at night.
AID00127277	All I wanted was a little escape, so I took some drugs to help me do that. Is that so bad?
AID00127278	Okay. Thanks anyway.
AID00127279	Uh... yeah, sure, no problem.
AID00127280	I saw you stealing the supplies.
AID00127281	Uh... look, it's not what you think. I can explain everything, if you'll just hear me out.
AID00127282	Do you know anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
AID00127283	No, can't say I do. I've got my own problems to worry about.
AID00127284	You look a little sick. Maybe you should see Dr. Richards.
AID00127285	[FAILED] No, no that's not necessary. I'm fine. Just a little stressed out, that's all.
AID00127286	Dilated eyes, increased heart rate... I think you took the drugs.
AID00127287	[SUCCEEDED] What?! Oh shit... how the fuck?! Oh man, I'm in some deep shit now.
AID00127288	Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
AID00127289	How are things around camp?
AID00127290	You kidding me, man? How are things? They're all fucked up, that's how things are!
AID00127291	Everyone is either starving or dying out here. Left out to dry by the rest of the NCR. Fuck this place.
AID00127292	I'd rather be anywhere else but here.
AID00127293	Do you know anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
AID00127294	Missing medical supplies? No, uhh... I don't know anything about that.
AID00127295	How're things around camp?
AID00127296	With the Legion defeated, things are great now.
AID00127297	Things are better now that the Legion at Nelson have been defeated.
AID00127298	We're doing okay for the time being. Not as many serious injuries lately.
AID00127299	If I was a mortician, business would be booming. As a Doctor, business is hard. Too many injuries that I can't do anything about.
AID00127300	The Legion has been hitting us pretty hard lately. Lots of casualties, not many people I can save.
AID00127301	I've studied lots of medicology.
AID00127302	[FAILED] Ahh... I see. Unfortunately you're experience with "medicology" isn't going to be any use to me here.
AID00127303	Just take this status report back to Major Polatli. That's all I need from you.
AID00127304	I want to talk about the attack on Nelson.
AID00127305	Are you ready?
AID00127306	The initial reports have come back already. Excellent work. This will buy us a lot of breathing room to get back on our feet here.
AID00127307	Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
AID00127308	You have my thanks, we owe you a lot.
AID00127309	I'd like to give you something to thank you for helping us.
AID00127310	Is there any intel on the Legion forces at Nelson?
AID00127311	The Legion forces have been reinforced and are looking pretty strong. It's going to be a tough fight.
AID00127312	The Legion forces are hurting pretty bad, actually. This is the perfect opportunity for us.
AID00127313	Reports have the Legion forces at Nelson sizable, but not insurmountable.
AID00127314	Do you have the troops to retake Nelson?
AID00127315	Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around the camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
AID00127316	We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around the camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
AID00127317	We've been reinforced fairly well, thanks to your help. I'd say the odds are in our favor.
AID00127318	However, if you help out a little more around the camp, we'd be in a good enough position to send our best men to help retake Nelson.
AID00127319	Thanks to your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
AID00127320	I did what I could for your patients.
AID00127321	Thanks for your help. I'll take it from here.
AID00127322	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
AID00127323	You weren't much help, but thanks anyway... I guess.
AID00127324	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
AID00127325	I'm not qualified to examine your patients.
AID00127326	That's too bad, but at least you didn't start hacking and slashing with a knife. I don't think Major Polatli could handle two doctors like that.
AID00127327	I'll send word to Major Polatli.
AID00127328	Goodbye.
AID00127329	We really need those supplies, so don't take your sweet time finding them.
AID00127330	I'd like to ask about something else.
AID00127331	Make it quick, I don't have time to stand around talking all day long.
AID00127332	This sounds pretty dangerous.
AID00127333	It's dangerous, but not as bad now that we've taken back Nelson from the Legion.
AID00127334	Of course it's dangerous! Damn Legion raiding parties have been giving us hell ever since they took over Nelson.
AID00127335	Hell, my men probably got ambushed by a raiding party! But we need those supplies, and we need them badly.
AID00127336	Any idea on where I should start looking?
AID00127337	I sent them to HELIOS One to see if they had any supplies they could spare. They've got to be somewhere between here and there.
AID00127338	I'd try searching the main road, or checking with the men at HELIOS One to see if they know anything.
AID00127339	How can I help with your supply problems?
AID00127340	The Major let me send out some troops to gather supplies, but unfortunately they never returned. I'm guessing they ran into some trouble on the way.
AID00127341	You can help by finding the troops and assisting them in bringing back any supplies they found.
AID00127342	Quit complaining, it's not that bad here.
AID00127343	Is that a joke? Have you looked around? Massive casualties, constant raids, barely any food or equipment... does that sound alright to you?
AID00127344	Shit, we haven't had a proper resupply since god knows when. Last time I sent troops out to find supplies, they never returned.
AID00127345	The Major sent you because we don't have any men to spare. So why don't you make yourself useful and find those troops and supplies for me.
AID00127346	The situation looks pretty bad here.
AID00127347	Bad? I've been doing this a long time and I haven't been in many places that were worse than this.
AID00127348	We've been out here on the front lines for a long time without any reinforcements or resupplies. That's what I need your help for.
AID00127349	I sent some troops out to find more supplies, but they never returned. I need you to track them down and help them bring back the supplies.
AID00127350	I wanted to ask about your missing men.
AID00127351	What do you want to know?
AID00127352	CFHRichardsPatientKilled
AID00127353	You killed him! What kind of Doctor are you? Get out of here now!

AID00127358	Hey! Be careful, I don't like people hurting my patients.
AID00127359	Enough! You were supposed to be helping them. It's best if you just leave now.
AID00127360	I need medical services.
AID00127361	There you go, all patched up. Anything else I can do for you?
AID00127362	I bet you do, but you won't be getting them from me. I heard about the crap you've been pulling, and I'll not risk my rep for you.
AID00127363	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
AID00127364	What can I do for you?
AID00127365	I'm addicted to something.
AID00127366	I can give you something that should help. I need to see some caps for treatment.
AID00127367	I could use some patching up.
AID00127368	If you were a trooper, I'd tell you to walk it off, but they're your caps.
AID00127369	Yep, you appear to be pretty cut up, but nothing some stitches and pain pills won't cure.
AID00127370	Do you have the caps to cover the pills and treatment?
AID00127371	Hot damn you got whooped good! This could take a while.
AID00127372	I will also require some caps to cover my supplies.
AID00127373	I have radiation sickness.
AID00127374	I can take care of that quick and easy, if you've got the caps.

AID00127408	All right. You'll get them at a discounted rate, thanks to all the supplies you've donated.
AID00127409	What seems to be the problem?
AID00127410	Anything else?
AID00127411	I've got a chem problem.
AID00127412	A common enough problem here in Freeside.
AID00127413	You don't show any signs of physical dependency. Nothing I can do for psychological dependency, I'm afraid.
AID00127414	I've been exposed to radiation.
AID00127415	That's easy enough to clear up.
AID00127416	Who hasn't? But your rad level is nothing dangerous.

AID00127427	TopsBillyKnightGoodbye
AID00127428	Fine, I'll come up with something later.
AID00127429	Here you go.
AID00127430	I'll come back when I have enough.
AID00127431	Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
AID00127432	Here you go.
AID00127433	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00127434	I'll come back when I have enough.
AID00127435	Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
AID00127436	Here you go, 150 caps.
AID00127437	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00127438	I'll pay you 100 and not a cap more.
AID00127439	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I see there's no fooling you in a horse trade. Fine - you've got a deal.
AID00127440	[FAILED] No, no I don't think you will. The deal is final.
AID00127441	If you don't I'll tear out your spleen and then rip this place down.
AID00127442	Ah. I suppose that's a very... compelling negotiating stance. Fine. The contract is yours. I hope you choke on it.
AID00127443	But how much do you lose on folk not coming into a place with a ghoul performer?
AID00127444	[SUCCEEDED] I admit that thought had crossed my mind. Maybe you're right - maybe I'd do better with a human act. He's all yours.
AID00127445	[FAILED] That may be the case, but I can't risk that kind of cash-flow. You'll have to do better than that.
AID00127446	He's not the right fit for this place. You'll find better performers.
AID00127447	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you've got a point. Plenty of Brahmin on the prairie, and all that. Fine, I'll cut him loose. He's all yours.
AID00127448	[FAILED] That's the stupidest argument I've ever heard. I'm not letting my star performer go without some guarantee of new incomes.
AID00127449	I could pay you.
AID00127450	Now, you see, you should have opened with that. I'll sell you his contract, but it will cost you.
AID00127451	I'd like to get Hadrian out of his contract.
AID00127452	Now why would I want to do that? His performances make me quite a lot of money.
AID00127453	Oh really? Are you going to waste my time again, or do you have something substantive to offer?
AID00127454	I'm back to talk about Hadrian's contract.

AID00127456	It's great to be up here, looking down at all your smiling faces. That won't last long.

AID00127458	Hey, look at this gal! I didn't know they let Brahmin into this joint!
AID00127459	Hey, look at this guy! Those muscles are unreal - I mean it, they're imaginary!

AID00127462	This gal's so sharp-eyed, she cuts herself every time she blinks!
AID00127463	I tell ya, you've got great eyes. You could spot a Super mutant at three paces.
AID00127464	Buddy, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
AID00127465	Sister, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
AID00127466	Whoa, you don't look too healthy. Maybe you should see a doctor. Or an undertaker.
AID00127467	I hear you've got a ready wit. Tell me when it's ready.
AID00127468	My friend, you've got style, grace, and charm - the style of a feral Ghoul, the grace of a Super mutant, and the charm of a Deathclaw.
AID00127469	Somebody told me the other day you were bright - I wasn't sure if he meant smart, or radioactive.
AID00127470	The way I hear it, you've got brains to spare. Looks to me like a 7-10 split.
AID00127471	And talk about your quick reflexes, this guy is so fast he beat me to the punchline.
AID00127472	And talk about your quick reflexes, this gal is so fast she beat me to the punchline.
AID00127473	Boy, you're clumsy. You're so clumsy when you slip in the shower, you fall up.
AID00127474	This guy right here, he's got an angel looking over his shoulder. If I were him, I'd get a restraining order.
AID00127475	This gal right here, she's got an angel looking over her shoulder. If I were her, I'd get a restraining order.
AID00127476	You know, some people have all the luck. Some people, not you.
AID00127477	Was that suit made to order? It was? And where were you at the time?
AID00127478	If you had your life to live over again, let me make a suggestion: Play in traffic.
AID00127479	Look at you, you look like a talent scout for a cemetery.
AID00127480	The more I think of you, the less I think of you.
AID00127481	How about a hand for the Rad Pack, the band that inspired that great saying, "Stop the music!"
AID00127482	Swank is here, ladies and gentlemen. Make yourself at home, Swank - hit somebody!
AID00127483	TopsBillyKnightPerformanceStrings
AID00127484	It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail.
AID00127485	Thank you everybody, you've been a great audience, good night.
AID00127486	It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out.
AID00127487	They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number!
AID00127488	My hotel room is so small, when I put the key in the lock, I broke the window!
AID00127489	How about that suit Benny wears? If I had a suit like that, the ladies would be all over me. What, you expect a punchline? This guy pays my salary!
AID00127490	I told my wife she was good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul.
AID00127491	I love these robots with the friendly little policeman's faces. Sure, they still rough you up, but they look so happy!
AID00127492	My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous.
AID00127493	I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next door to a brothel.
AID00127494	I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest.
AID00127495	I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong?
AID00127496	I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me!
AID00127497	My wife and I know the secret to a happy marriage. Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant. She goes Mondays, I go Fridays.
AID00127498	I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back.
AID00127499	I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood.
AID00127500	People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark!
AID00127501	So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole.
AID00127502	I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown.
AID00127503	I hear James Garret drove 5,000 head of Brahmin to New Reno. No bodies, just the heads.
AID00127504	A ghoul goes to a doctor and he says "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says "Son, that's called your face."
AID00127505	TopsBillyKnghtPerformance
AID00127506	Well, tough luck. Let me know if you change your mind.
AID00127507	Ain't my mind needs changing, kid, it's Garret's.
AID00127508	I could talk to Garret and try to convince him to let you go.
AID00127509	Heh, good luck. Garret's a tough, mean sonofabitch, he's not likely to give up. Let me know if you make any headway.
AID00127510	Sure, I bet you're raking in the cash in this dump.
AID00127511	Really? How much are you making?
AID00127512	Judging from the economic state of Freeside, they can't be paying you that much.
AID00127513	Okay, I admit it, I ain't exactly rolling in caps here, but whaddya want? I'm under contract, I can't get out.
AID00127514	Eesh... say, you wouldn't happen to have been my manager in a past life, would you? You've got all his money-smarts.
AID00127515	I can't right now.
AID00127516	That's okay, I still need some time to get everything together. The logistics of an order like this are headache inducing.
AID00127517	We won't need to head out for a while yet, so stop back when you have the time.
AID00127518	Count me in.
AID00127519	Perfect. We're still getting everything together, but I can always find a use for idle hands in the meantime.
AID00127520	Once we're settled, we'll head out to the rendezvous point.
AID00127521	I'm working on it.
AID00127522	Well work fucking faster. I don't like thinking there's someone out there that hates me more than I hate them.
AID00127523	She's dead.
AID00127524	Guess I don't have to worry about talking with her, then. About fucking time. Any longer and I was gonna track you both down.
AID00127525	Anyway, Glory's been antsy lately because that big deal she's been working on is finally going down.
AID00127526	If this thing goes down, we'll have it made. Fucking made, I tell you! Talk to her about it. I'm sure she'll want you along.
AID00127527	And don't think I forgot your pay. A job well done is its own reward, but it doesn't pay for pussy at the local brothel, does it?
AID00127528	Just thought I'd say hi.
AID00127529	<Jean-Baptiste just stares at you.>
AID00127530	Count me out.
AID00127531	You already agreed to take the job, asshole. There's no backing out now.
AID00127532	I've changed my mind. I'll take the job.
AID00127533	I'll do it.
AID00127534	Find her, bring her back here so we can talk. Needless to say, there's some good money in it for you.
AID00127535	Who is this girl?
AID00127536	Her name's Rose of Sharon Cassidy. That's some fancy shit, right? Don't know what her mother was thinking with a name like that.
AID00127537	But this girl and I, we need to have a discussion. Find her, bring her here, so I can talk to her, one-on-one.
AID00127538	In that case, I'm out.
AID00127539	I thought so. Come back when you've got a backbone.
AID00127540	I'm in.
AID00127541	What were you informed of?
AID00127542	That you would have something for me. Now do you or not?
AID00127543	Never mind, I must have confused this with one of my other deliveries.
AID00127544	Fine, now do you have the package or not?
AID00127545	
AID00127546	[SUCCEEDED] Such a thing is possible. I've been out in the field for some time. Fine, this should cover your grievance.
AID00127547	Now, the package, if you will.
AID00127548	My employers managed to negotiate a small fee for this drop a short time ago.
AID00127549	[FAILED] I've heard no such report. I'd have to check with my contacts before agreeing to such an exchange, and there's no time for that.
AID00127550	Now, the package, if you will.
AID00127551	Surely you were told to pay the Van Graffs' messenger?
AID00127552	Where's the payment?
AID00127553	I wasn't informed there was to be an exchange on my part. What are you talking about?
AID00127554	It's right here.
AID00127555	Ah, then our business is concluded. Tell your superiors that we will contact them shortly.
AID00127556	Who is we?
AID00127557	We were told there would be no questions. Do you have what we requested or not?
AID00127558	I'm sorry, you've mistaken me for someone else.
AID00127559	I don't think so. My men watched you head straight for this location. Now do you have what we requested?
AID00127560	Maybe.
AID00127561	Don't play games with me. The question was just a formality. Now do you have what we requested?
AID00127562	I am.
AID00127563	Do you have what we requested?
AID00127564	Okay, I'll let her know that you'll help.
AID00127565	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00127566	Will you answer my questions now?
AID00127567	I'll let her know.
AID00127568	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00127569	First, let me ask you some questions.
AID00127570	Questions can wait, Joana can't.
AID00127571	Goodbye.
AID00127572	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, huh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
AID00127573	Until next round.
AID00127574	She didn't know if you were still alive.
AID00127575	Then she has to know! I'm ready to help her escape, once and for all.
AID00127576	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
AID00127577	I'm here on Joana's behalf.
AID00127578	What did you say...? I mean, Joana sent you?
AID00127579	Please, tell me! Is she all right? When did you see her? What does she have to say?
AID00127580	About your problem, let's go to your room.
AID00127581	Follow me, hon.
AID00127582	What can you tell me about the Omertas.
AID00127583	The "where" is Freeside, and "now" would be a good time.
AID00127584	The Beards will be there.
AID00127585	Carlitos says he's ready to cash in his chips.
AID00127586	I see. Well, he can count on Little Beard and me for an assist. Tell us where and when, and we'll be there.
AID00127587	Carlitos is ready to cash in his chips.
AID00127588	I see. Well, he can count on Little Beard and me for an assist. Tell us where and when, and we'll be there.
AID00127589	So you said. All Little Beard and me need to know is the when and where.
AID00127590	Never mind.
AID00127591	See you around.
AID00127592	We'll take care of Carlitos, don't worry.
AID00127593	What sort of debt do you owe Carlitos?
AID00127594	Let's just say it had something to do with the beards, and leave it at that.
AID00127595	Does the name "Carlitos" ring a bell?
AID00127596	Depends on why you're asking.
AID00127597	I heard sounds of a struggle in the Ultra-Luxe Penthouse.
AID00127598	You've done the right thing, citizen. Reporting struggles, scuffles, and tussles is the civic duty of every man, woman, and child.
AID00127599	Thanks to you, we can all sleep in our beds a little sounder, knowing that swift justice awaits those who take moral shortcuts for personal gain.
AID00127600	Rest assured, I will apprehend the perpetrator and see him or her punished. Even though, in some ways, evil is its own punishment.
AID00127601	Er... probably just some mixed up people who are really sorry.
AID00127602	[FAILED] Who gives a rat's patoot if they're sorry? Sorry's what they'll be when they're strung up and lynched by my daddy's posse.
AID00127603	These White Knuckles got hell to pay, I'll see to that when I get outta here.
AID00127604	Your dad's powerful. Someone wants him to feud with the White Glove Society.
AID00127605	[SUCCEEDED] My daddy's got a lot of enemies. It don't make no sense that the White Pants Society would kidnap me. He's here to do business with them.
AID00127606	Well, you got a point. But if you don't know who it is, my daddy's gonna be awful mad he ain't got anyone to shoot over this.
AID00127607	All right. Let's get out of here.
AID00127608	I'll do the job you proposed.
AID00127609	I wanted to check on the troopers sent from Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00127610	Yeah, they were here a while ago. Gave them all I could, which wasn't much. But as many problems as we're having here, I know they've got it worse.
AID00127611	I've seen soldiers get assigned there. It's like they got told they were gonna die. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
AID00127612	If you're trying to track them down, we put a GPS marker in the supply crate. You can track it with your Pip-Boy. Good luck.
AID00127613	Veronica.
AID00127614	Cass.
AID00127615	Boone.
AID00127616	Arcade.
AID00127617	<Hushed> Would my companion here make a suitable replacement meal?
AID00127618	Which one?
AID00127619	Hmm. He's a little thin, but he looks like he comes from good stock with that strong jaw and upright posture.
AID00127620	Perhaps a little rugged, a little gamey. But he is in good shape and looks healthy.
AID00127621	From the smell of her I'd say we can skip the whiskey marinade. But other than her liver she seems to be in working order.
AID00127622	Her skin has a certain supple quality to it, doesn't it? She's kept it well. How mouth-watering.
AID00127623	I'm sorry, but it absolutely must be a human. Former doesn't count.
AID00127624	I assume you're joking.
AID00127625	Very well. If you're able to convince young Mr. Gunderson to return to his father, replace him in the freezer with your friend and we'll have a deal.
AID00127626	[Attack] I can't let you get away with what you've done.
AID00127627	I'll think about it.
AID00127628	Very well, but I'll need to know soon or I'll be forced to make other plans.
AID00127629	I'll do it.
AID00127630	Splendid, splendid. The boy is being held in the kitchen beneath the Gourmand. Here are some keys that will allow you access to him.
AID00127631	The elder Gunderson is staying in our penthouse. I understand he's hired security, so be careful if you go up there.
AID00127632	And our Mr. St. Clair resides to the north. He rarely strays far from his house, and he's surrounded it with booby traps.
AID00127633	What about the boy you kidnapped?
AID00127634	Ted Gunderson is his name. It would be simplest if you could convince him this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
AID00127635	But if he won't listen, we can't very well let him go. He'll have to be slaughtered and served. Then we wouldn't need the replacement.
AID00127636	But you would need to deal with his father, Heck. Perhaps if you could smear some of Ted's blood around his father's hotel room, you could frame him.
AID00127637	Tell me what I need to do.
AID00127638	I need a replacement, and I need the boy taken care of. The replacement must be healthy and well-bred. One can't very well make steak from gristle.
AID00127639	With so little time, we'll have go after our original choice, Carlyle St. Clair. He lives in a shack north of here. For freshness, we need him alive.
AID00127640	If you could send him here or knock him out with this and drag him into the dumpster next to his house, we can do the rest.
AID00127641	What did you do?
AID00127642	I asked for a last-minute replacement. And they stole the son of the most dangerous Brahmin baron in New Vegas while he stayed at this very hotel.
AID00127643	Needless to say, this could be a disaster if things aren't put back the way they should be. And I still need somebody reputable to serve for dinner.
AID00127644	Strictly speaking, we're no longer allowed to eat people. But I'm hoping the right person and preparation might sway Marjorie to see things my way.
AID00127645	I think you have the wrong person for this job.
AID00127646	Perhaps I do. Forget I mentioned it.
AID00127647	[Attack] He's the least of your problems right now, cannibal.
AID00127648	You barbarous cur.
AID00127649	The main course is a person?
AID00127650	Yes. The wrong person. We scouted the right one for weeks. The heir to a mercantile empire. Sort of a black sheep.
AID00127651	He cut ties with his family and left their estate to wander. He was ideal. Corn-fed and well-to-do, but no one to miss him if he were to disappear.
AID00127652	Unfortunately the trap my subordinates set for him failed. And as he escaped, he saw their faces. Now he's wary.
AID00127653	Do you have any work that needs to be done?
AID00127654	No, not from the likes of you, I'm afraid. I don't think you'd have the stomach for it. Better look elsewhere.
AID00127655	I do, but I need someone I know I can rely on. And I haven't heard a thing about you.
AID00127656	Perhaps if you made more of a name for yourself around the Strip, we could talk. But not before.
AID00127657	Yes, I'm glad you asked. I've heard about you, you know. You strike me as just the sort of person who can help me.
AID00127658	I'm in a bind. I've been planning an exquisite Society dinner, but there's a bit of a problem with the main course.
AID00127659	He's got a powerful and temperamental father.
AID00127660	Let's talk about something else.
AID00127661	Indeed. Let's.
AID00127662	So it isn't true?
AID00127663	I can assure you that the only thing the White Glove Society is guilty of is preparing the tastiest cuisine you'll ever sample.
AID00127664	That is, of course, if you can afford it.
AID00127665	<Lie> I sort of tasted human flesh once. Mmm mmm good. Tell me all your secrets.
AID00127666	[FAILED] Please, you're embarrassing yourself. I must request that you change the subject.
AID00127667	<Lie> I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
AID00127668	[SUCCEEDED] Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
AID00127669	I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
AID00127670	Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
AID00127671	I've heard your group dines on human flesh.
AID00127672	Ah, yes, I've heard that one too. Jealous people say such nasty things. I feel sorry for them.
AID00127673	<Player asks about the Chairmen>
AID00127674	Goodbye.
AID00127675	<Player dismisses Promoter>
AID00127676	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
AID00127677	The Tops casino, my friend! If you're in the mood to knock back a few and frolic the night away, ain't no better place on Earth!
AID00127678	Who is the Lonesome Drifter?
AID00127679	Way I hear it, he's some whack job who used to spend his nights sitting around a campfire and howling to himself.
AID00127680	"Who wants to hear songs that make you wanna cry?" I try to tell them. But hey, they don't pay me to ask questions.
AID00127681	Do me a favor - go see the show. Otherwise they'll think I didn't do my job.
AID00127682	A velvety-voiced cool cat fresh out of New Reno, that's who! When Bruce sings, his smokey, dulcet tones will transport you to another world!
AID00127683	Who's Bruce Issac?
AID00127684	Get away from me.
AID00127685	No need to be rude, pal. Just trying to bring the joy of entertainment into your life!
AID00127686	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
AID00127687	At the coolest, hippest, swinging-est joint on the Strip, that's where! The Tops, baby - don't miss it!
AID00127688	What sort of show are you talking about?
AID00127689	Hadrian, the insult comic! "Did I stutter, fucktard?
AID00127690	See, I'm using insults to promote the act. That was my idea!
AID00127691	One-liners! The epi-tome of comedy! Little nuggets of hilarity irresistibly bringing forth laughter!
AID00127692	You know, like "is that your face, or is a bowl of puke stuck in your collar?" I tell you, you gotta see this show!
AID00127693	What sort of debt do you owe Carlitos?
AID00127694	I framed Heck Gunderson and sent a Securitron to arrest him.
AID00127695	So the baron has slaughtered his last Brahmin. How delightful. He was a pox on our business.
AID00127696	He would've driven the price of beef down to the point where any poor wretch could afford it. Can you imagine?
AID00127697	But now we can price it even higher, create a new luxury market. Not for you, of course. You'll get a special discount.
AID00127698	We should attack from the ridge on the east.
AID00127699	East it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
AID00127700	Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
AID00127701	Let's move out!
AID00127702	Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
AID00127703	Let's attack from the north.
AID00127704	North it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
AID00127705	Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
AID00127706	Let's move out!
AID00127707	Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
AID00127708	I'm not ready yet.
AID00127709	Make it quick, we don't want to lose the element of surprise.
AID00127710	Let's do this.
AID00127711	We don't have many troops, so we can only attack from one direction. Where should we focus the attack?
AID00127712	Why?
AID00127713	A little morbid, isn't it?
AID00127714	Maybe, but the situation around here calls for it. You gonna help or not?
AID00127715	Let's talk about something else.
AID00127716	All right. What did you want to know?
AID00127717	What's the Atomic Wrangler?
AID00127718	A den of iniquity. The Garrets do more than their share to keep the locals drunk or high enough to stay lazy.
AID00127719	Their thugs, on the other hand, they keep wired on chems to stay dangerous. What is it with Freeside and brother-sister psychopath teams?
AID00127720	Tell me about the Van Graffs.
AID00127721	Oh, them. They sell energy weapons, which are very popular with better-heeled prospectors looking to explore the wastes.
AID00127722	Stay clear of them. Brother and sister are both psychopaths, though at least Gloria is rational. Jean-Baptiste likes killing.
AID00127723	What's up with the Atomic Wrangler?
AID00127724	Their joint is the only place in Freeside to get it all under one roof. They've got gambling, booze, chems, and whores.
AID00127725	They're good folks, just don't cross them. They're known for tidying up loose ends with a bullet to the brain box.
AID00127726	Who are the Van Graffs?
AID00127727	They are the local energy weapon dealers in Freeside. When it comes to lasers and plasma, they're the only game in town and they keep it that way.
AID00127728	Gloria's men are the best armed in Freeside and ruthless to boot, but her brother, Jean-Baptiste Cutting, puts them all to shame.
AID00127729	Who is The King?
AID00127730	If you haven't heard of The King, you must have been living under a rock or something.
AID00127731	The King has his boys all over Freeside. He controls the water pump and is essentially the go-to guy for what goes around here.
AID00127732	I'd like to know more about Freeside.
AID00127733	What do you want to know?
AID00127734	What do you know about Mick and Ralph?
AID00127735	I know they sell a lot of guns - as if that's what Freeside needs. I hear Mick handles the guns. No idea what Ralph does.
AID00127736	Who are The Kings?
AID00127737	They've been Freeside's gang for the past five years or so, ever since Mr. House and his Three Families pushed everyone else out of Vegas.
AID00127738	They've done a lot of good for the community - but that seems to be changing. The flood of NCR squatters has been an affront to them.
AID00127739	I guess that explains the situation with the water pump. Usually The King wouldn't let his crew bully folks around like that.
AID00127740	What's all the fuss about the water pump?
AID00127741	Bill Ronte installed that pump a few years ago, back when he was sober. It was a major improvement for the community.
AID00127742	But lately The Kings have started charging locals to use it - and NCR squatters twice as much. That'll come to no good.
AID00127743	Let's talk about Freeside.
AID00127744	What did you want to know?
AID00127745	Santiago's your man.
AID00127746	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AID00127747	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AID00127748	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127749	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AID00127750	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffiic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AID00127751	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127752	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AID00127753	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AID00127754	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AID00127755	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AID00127756	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
AID00127757	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127758	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
AID00127759	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127760	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
AID00127761	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
AID00127762	You wanted a smooth-talker for an escort? I found one.
AID00127763	And who would that be?
AID00127764	So tell me about your plan.
AID00127765	Caesar asked us to provide a distraction on the Strip. So when he gives the word we're going to launch an all out assault on the Strip.
AID00127766	First we're going to blow the Embassy, then we're going to use soldiers to kill every last motherfucker on the Strip. Then we'll run this joint.
AID00127767	That'll teach Not-At-Home what can go on while he sits in his fucking ivory tower lording down from on high.
AID00127768	
AID00127769	[SUCCEEDED] Are you shitting me? You didn't even know what the plan was? Yeah, as a last request I guess we can give you that courtesy.
AID00127770	As a last request, will you tell me more about your plan?
AID00127771	[FAILED] Sorry, but you're going to have to die ignorant.
AID00127772	Err.. can you tell me what the plan was?
AID00127773	Did one of your contractors get lost?
AID00127774	Yeah, Clanden will be hard to replace but not impossible. We'll find contractors just like him without breaking a sweat.
AID00127775	What's this place?
AID00127776	You saw our front sign, didn't you? This is where all the beautiful signs of the Strip become a reality.
AID00127777	It all comes from Michael Angelo's imagination. We do a little work here and there too, sure, but he's the real artist.
AID00127778	You saw our front sign, didn't you? This is where all the beautiful signs of the Strip become a reality.
AID00127779	I'm looking for Michael Angelo.
AID00127780	Check out the back of the shop, he's usually working there.
AID00127781	Goodbye.
AID00127782	Bye.
AID00127783	Who is Michael Angelo?
AID00127784	He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
AID00127785	Where can I find Michael Angelo?
AID00127786	How long have you worked here?
AID00127787	I've been here over a year now. Though I'm not one to get tied for long.
AID00127788	I plan to roam the Wasteland once I'm ready. The people need light and kindness, there's too much fear and pain out there already.
AID00127789	Goodbye.
AID00127790	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00127791	Goodbye.
AID00127792	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
AID00127793	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AID00127794	Tell me about your problem.
AID00127795	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
AID00127796	I have questions about Gomorrah.
AID00127797	I'd like to know more about you.
AID00127798	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AID00127799	Goodbye.
AID00127800	Stay for a while, hon. Jump in bed and let me do the rest.
AID00127801	I'd like to talk first.
AID00127802	All right, honey. What do you want to know?
AID00127803	I'm ready.
AID00127804	Okay, lay down and I'll take care of you.
AID00127805	I want to know about Cachino.
AID00127806	Tell me about the Omertas.
AID00127807	About your problem, let's go to your room.
AID00127808	Goodbye.
AID00127809	I have questions about you.
AID00127810	Yes?
AID00127811	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AID00127812	Goodbye.
AID00127813	I have other questions.
AID00127814	I want to know about Carlitos.
AID00127815	Tell me about Cachino.
AID00127816	Tell me about the Omertas.
AID00127817	Goodbye.
AID00127818	Come back anytime!
AID00127819	See you soon, friend!
AID00127820	Yeah, don't cause me any trouble, okay?
AID00127821	Tell me about the Strip.
AID00127822	It's the most amazing place in the world, don't you think? This must be what it was like to live a thousand years ago!
AID00127823	There are three casinos open for business - Gomorrah, The Tops, and the Ultra-Luxe. They get nicer in that order.
AID00127824	This here's the monorail station leading in from Camp McCarran. Most of my business is with soldiers coming and going on furlough.
AID00127825	Let me see what you have for sale.
AID00127826	Take your pick.
AID00127827	Of course! I've got a special discount for special people, like you.
AID00127828	A friend of The Strip's a friend of mine.
AID00127829	Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your business, but dealing with you carries extra costs.
AID00127830	I'll sell to you, if only to get you out of sight as soon as possible.
AID00127831	What do you sell?
AID00127832	Non-alcoholic beverages and snack foods. The casinos get to sell booze. No one else does.
AID00127833	I planted evidence in Heck Gunderson's room.
AID00127834	You made it past his guards, then? Excellent. Send a Securitron up to his room. It's programmed to investigate anything suspicious.
AID00127835	Couldn't Heck just claim intruders killed his son?
AID00127836	No. Everyone he meets, he tells the same story. That his son disappeared from the casino, not from his room. He'll look guilty.
AID00127837	Ted Gunderson is dead. He wouldn't listen to reason.
AID00127838	I see. Well this could get out of hand very quickly unless something is done to keep the elder Gunderson in check.
AID00127839	You mustn't kill him, though. The publicity would be a disaster. I need you to handle this quietly, like we discussed.
AID00127840	A little blood in his suite should do the trick. And if you have a Securitron arrest him, our involvement will appear nonexistent.
AID00127841	I convinced Ted it was all a terrible misunderstanding.
AID00127842	Good. Having his father's attention cast upon me was the last thing I needed.
AID00127843	Now if you can lure Mr. St. Clair out of his home and into captivity, and he's still disease-free, I shall breathe a sigh of relief.
AID00127844	Not yet.
AID00127845	I see. Keep me in the know.
AID00127846	You have done very well in keeping this business low-key. I appreciate your discretion. I'll be sure to drop your name during our functions.
AID00127847	I hope you understand what a tremendous boon this will be to your standing in society.
AID00127848	Did you succeed in turning the White Glove Society back to cannibalism?
AID00127849	We'll know after tonight's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
AID00127850	That way, they will all have crossed the same silly taboo. They'll have to reconsider it. Even Marjorie.
AID00127851	It's all image with her, anyway. She just needs to realize the only difference between savage and sophisticated is the proper seasoning.
AID00127852	We'll know after tomorrow night's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
AID00127853	That way, they will all have crossed the same silly taboo. They'll have to reconsider it. Even Marjorie.
AID00127854	It's all image with her, anyway. She just needs to realize the only difference between savage and sophisticated is the proper seasoning.
AID00127855	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the Gunderson boy.
AID00127856	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the late Mr. St. Clair.
AID00127857	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of your former travel partner.
AID00127858	Everyone at the banquet loved it! I told them what it was and the room was quiet for a moment, but then we all had a hearty laugh.
AID00127859	I'll try talking with her, but not for free.
AID00127860	Never mind. I don't need anything.
AID00127861	200 caps and we have a deal.
AID00127862	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00127863	I'll try, but not for free.
AID00127864	Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
AID00127865	NCRSnifferChallengePlayer
AID00127866	You there! Stop!
AID00127867	Hey there.
AID00127868	How rude.
AID00127869	What do you need artillery for?
AID00127870	The best marksman of the NCR are usually at the rear of any battle. The gun will allow us to strike at them.
AID00127871	Where did you get the gun, anyway?
AID00127872	The trader, Dale Barton, salvaged it from a military base in Arizona. Yuma, I believe.
AID00127873	I'll see what I can do.
AID00127874	The tribe calling themselves the Boomers is obsessed with such weapons, I've been told. You can probably find a spare firing mechanism there.
AID00127875	Is there anything that you need me to do?
AID00127876	We recently obtained an artillery weapon, but we don't have the part or the skill to fix it.
AID00127877	The artillery weapon needs the firing mechanism replaced. Any help you can offer would be appreciated.
AID00127878	Milo Initiate
AID00127879	Your howitzer is operational.
AID00127880	Well done. It will be very useful in the coming battle against the snipers the NCR will no doubt have hidden in the hills near the Dam.
AID00127881	Let's talk about something else.
AID00127882	Make it quick.
AID00127883	What's your take on the NCR's position here?
AID00127884	It's no picnic, I'll tell you that much. My troops are out here every day dying for the NCR, but they've left us out to dry.
AID00127885	We have no men or supplies and we're stretched too thin trying to guard the entire river.
AID00127886	If the brass back home could get their heads out of their asses long enough to send support, we could turn this all around.
AID00127887	How do things look around the camp?
AID00127888	Things are looking good. With the new resources and support, morale is at the highest it's ever been around here.
AID00127889	Well, things have been improving lately. More supplies, more troops. We might actually be able to turn things around.
AID00127890	We're hanging in there. Things wouldn't be so bad if we could actually get some reinforcements or supplies, but we'll just have to survive for now.
AID00127891	Not good. We still haven't gotten any support from the rest of the NCR and the Legion is kicking our ass right now.
AID00127892	I have some questions about the NCR.
AID00127893	I can spare a few moments, make it quick.
AID00127894	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
AID00127895	Tell me about Gomorrah.
AID00127896	I have questions about you.
AID00127897	I'd like to talk about Carlitos.
AID00127898	I actually found you an escort who's a ghoul *and* a cowboy.
AID00127899	Imagine that! What's his name and when's he start?
AID00127900	Her name's Beatrix, and she can start immediately.
AID00127901	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
AID00127902	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
AID00127903	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127904	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
AID00127905	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
AID00127906	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00127907	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
AID00127908	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
AID00127909	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
AID00127910	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.

AID00127920	This should flush those rads out quickly.
AID00127921	I don't have the caps.
AID00127922	I'm sorry, but I can't give you meds for nothing. There are too many people who need these supplies.
AID00127923	VFSFollowersBarks
AID00127924	Mortimer wants to release the kid, if he'll cooperate. I'm the negotiator.
AID00127925	Mmm. Yes. He was none too pleased when he discovered who we took. The boy is in the freezer, back through the kitchen.
AID00127926	[Attack] I'll make sure you don't live to tell him.
AID00127927	<Lie> I'll do the job you proposed. Where do I find Ted Gunderson?
AID00127928	<Lie> I'll do it. Where can I find Ted Gunderson?
AID00127929	Splendid, splendid. The boy is being held in the kitchen beneath the Gourmand. Here are some keys that will allow you access to him.
AID00127930	The elder Gunderson is staying in our penthouse. I understand he's hired security, so be careful if you go up there.
AID00127931	And our Mr. St. Clair resides to the north. He rarely strays far from his house, and he's surrounded it with booby traps.
AID00127932	I'll be on my way, Mr. House.
AID00127933	You think your Securitrons can defeat Caesar's Legion *and* the NCR?
AID00127934	What happens next?
AID00127935	What happens next?
AID00127936	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
AID00127937	I can do better.
AID00127938	I guess I'll accept your original offer.
AID00127939	I can get a better price elsewhere.
AID00127940	I'll hang on to the Chip for now.
AID00127941	[Barter] for better terms.
AID00127942	[SUCCEEDED] Very well... five times your delivery bonus - not one cap more.
AID00127943	It's a great start... but well below market price.
AID00127944	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
AID00127945	I've always taken business negotiations seriously. I advise you to do the same.
AID00127946	Raise your price or... or... you'll be "chip outta luck."
AID00127947	1000 caps? Sounds good. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00127948	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
AID00127949	Fine - give me the Chip, and I'll pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
AID00127950	I have some questions to ask first...
AID00127951	I'll be happy to satisfy your every curiosity once the Platinum Chip has been delivered.
AID00127952	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
AID00127953	Of course. Here it is.
AID00127954	So Kimball's dead. So what?
AID00127955	Every step of my plan has been precisely calculated and was, until now, well-executed.
AID00127956	I did my best, but the Legion did better.
AID00127957	Your incompetence has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
AID00127958	My only regret is that he got away.
AID00127959	Your impulsivity has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
AID00127960	It was an accident.
AID00127961	Your "accident" has jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
AID00127962	Up to this point, your efforts yielded near-perfect results. But now I'm forced to fumble in the dark - to gamble.
AID00127963	Light must be brought to this darkness.
AID00127964	I'm going to kill you now, Mr. House.
AID00127965	I'm done working for you.
AID00127966	This is no time to be droll...
AID00127967	What's the next step?
AID00127968	The Legion has nothing left to wait for. Their assault on the dam could begin at any moment.
AID00127969	Before that happens, I'll ask you to complete one other task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
AID00127970	When the Legion assaults the dam, the Brotherhood will attack the NCR and weaken them.
AID00127971	Not surprising. Also not acceptable.
AID00127972	I didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill them. This was a waste of time.
AID00127973	Go back to the bunker and destroy it. My directions have been clear from the start.
AID00127974	The Brotherhood of Steel has been wiped out.
AID00127975	Singlehandedly destroying a Brotherhood of Steel bunker is quite an accomplishment. Platoons of NCR troops have died, trying to do the same.
AID00127976	This welcome news comes just in time, as events in the wider world are coming to a head...
AID00127977	I had to wipe out their leadership.
AID00127978	There's more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes. Or went, that is - cats being extinct.
AID00127979	I don't promote political assassination as a first option, but it has a long and storied history. I'll consider the Boomers neutralized.
AID00127980	The Boomers and I don't get along. I'd rather keep my distance.
AID00127981	It seems diplomacy is not your forte.
AID00127982	Given the strength of your past performance, I think we can let this go without further comment. I'm pulling you on to a new assignment.
AID00127983	I've secured their loyalty. They'll do as I say.
AID00127984	Well done. The Boomers' firepower may prove an advantage when the battle for Hoover Dam comes around.
AID00127985	The Omertas who were conspiring against you are dead.
AID00127986	Well done. They won't be causing any trouble, then.
AID00127987	I've found evidence of an Omerta plot.
AID00127988	I don't employ you to uncover evidence. This isn't a court of law.
AID00127989	If the Omertas pose a threat to the physical or economic security of the Vegas Strip, I want you to do whatever it takes to neutralize that threat.
AID00127990	I'm still looking into it.
AID00127991	Then look harder.
AID00127992	Are you ready to get out?
AID00127993	Never mind. Let's get you out of here.
AID00127994	Wait a minute.
AID00127995	Let's do this.
AID00127996	Okay. See you soon.
AID00127997	Are you ready to get out?
AID00127998	I'm ready. Just give the word and we'll meet you at the lobby, in an hour.
AID00127999	It's not a good time right now, hon. It's got to be around midnight.
AID00128000	We're ready. Let's get the hell out of here before they recognize us.
AID00128001	He'll meet us in Freeside around midnight. I'll sneak you out in disguise.
AID00128002	He'll meet us in Freeside around midnight. I'll sneak you out in disguise.
AID00128003	Okay, I got clothes I can use for that. When you give the word, I'll let the other girls know and we'll meet you at the lobby.
AID00128004	I have news from Carlitos.
AID00128005	Yes?
AID00128006	What will you do now?
AID00128007	It'll be all I can do to supply the NCR with the amount of weapons they want, so I'll be pretty busy for the foreseeable future.
AID00128008	Oh, you're probably wondering if you still have a job! I don't have anything open at the moment, sadly.
AID00128009	But we're going to need all the help we can get transporting guns to the NCR, so stop by every now and then and I might have a delivery job for you.
AID00128010	And before I forget, here's your share of the take from the warehouse job. You can keep the armor. Thanks again for all your help.
AID00128011	Wouldn't you have made just as much money dealing with the Legion?
AID00128012	Hardly. They've got a lot of soldiers, and slaves. But they don't come close to having the amount of wealth the NCR has.
AID00128013	When I said we were going to be rich, I meant it. The deal I brokered with the NCR netted me fives times what Caesar paid.
AID00128014	Keeping Caesar's money was just a bonus.
AID00128015	So now the Van Graffs are allied with the NCR?
AID00128016	Well... not exactly. The deal wasn't exactly sanctioned by my mother, but she'll come around when she hears about the profit I made.
AID00128017	If she's smart, and she is, believe me, she'll turn this to her own advantage and make a bundle off our new "connections" in the NCR.
AID00128018	Just start at the beginning.
AID00128019	Caesar has been making overtures to prominent suppliers for some time now. Usually, they're too scared of him to cross him and just pay or flee.
AID00128020	I saw an opportunity and negotiated a deal with the NCR - I help draw some of their enemy's troops into a trap and they agree to buy from me.
AID00128021	Normally, those stuck-up bastards wouldn't have anything to do with us, but their situation is precarious, and this chance was too tempting.
AID00128022	I thought you hated the NCR?
AID00128023	Oh, I do. They're a bunch of corrupt, bullying fools who think they can tell everyone how to live their lives, and my family's fought them for years.
AID00128024	But that's just it. Do you know how large the NCR army is? If they wanted to, they could have beaten us a dozen times over.
AID00128025	Do you know why they haven't? Money. Every time things have gotten too tense, we've paid them off and laid low for a while.
AID00128026	They're an enemy we can live with. This Caesar, on the other hand, is a different animal.
AID00128027	We've heard reports for years from our agents to the east. He doesn't tolerate his enemies, he makes examples of them.
AID00128028	And he doesn't have friends. Only servants. And the Van Graffs serve no one but themselves.
AID00128029	Given that, the choice was rather simple.
AID00128030	For starters, what in the hell just happened?
AID00128031	We made a lot of money, that's what. The Legion paid us to deliver weapons, and the NCR paid us to deliver the Legion. Or some of them, anyway.
AID00128032	VFSGloriaEndingDialog
AID00128033	I suppose you have a few questions.
AID00128034	Just thought I'd stop in and say hello.
AID00128035	You're welcome here any time.
AID00128036	VFSGloriaKillThemAll
AID00128037	Their commander is down! Kill the rest!
AID00128038	VFSLegionOfficerAckbar
AID00128039	It's a trap! Fall back!
AID00128040	VFSGloriaSpeaksToLegionOfficer
AID00128041	I trust you find everything acceptable?
AID00128042	Everything seems to be in order. Caesar will not soon forget this.
AID00128043	No, I imagine he won't.
AID00128044	Is anything wrong?
AID00128045	Not if we don't screw this up. I'm counting on you to do your part. Just wait for the signal. You'll know what to do.
AID00128046	Got it.
AID00128047	That's what I like about you. You follow orders, for the most part. Just remember to wait for the signal.
AID00128048	Wait, what?
AID00128049	I don't have time to explain now. Just do as you're told and we'll all be rich.
AID00128050	VFSGloriaWarehouseInstructions
AID00128051	They're taking an awfully long time inspecting the weapons. I'm beginning to think they're doing it just to unnerve us.
AID00128052	Don't let them rattle you, though. The deal's almost done. There's just one last piece of business left.
AID00128053	Speaking of which, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Things are about to get a little crazy. When I give the signal, follow my lead, okay?
AID00128054	It's not safe for me to go back. The Legion will attack me on sight.
AID00128055	You'll need a disguise, then. Or overwhelming firepower. Whatever works.
AID00128056	Sorry for the inconvenience, but it can't be helped. This is too important.
AID00128057	And what then? You want me to kill Caesar?
AID00128058	How do I open the hatch?
AID00128059	No thanks, Mr. House.
AID00128060	Why should I be working for you?
AID00128061	All right, I'll do as you ask.
AID00128062	What's inside the hatch?
AID00128063	How do I open the hatch?
AID00128064	You can't - but the Chip can. The hatch will recognize the Platinum Chip and "open sesame."
AID00128065	Let me make sure I'm ready.
AID00128066	Whatever you've got to do, do it quick!
AID00128067	Let's head out.
AID00128068	It's now or never, let's go.
AID00128069	Goodbye.
AID00128070	Okay, I'm on it.
AID00128071	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
AID00128072	How do I get her out of Gomorrah?
AID00128073	Goodbye.
AID00128074	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
AID00128075	All right! See you soon.
AID00128076	Okay, I'm on it.
AID00128077	All right! See you soon.
AID00128078	All right! See you soon.
AID00128079	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
AID00128080	I'll be near the entrance but I need to keep out of sight. The Omertas have contacts, and they're still looking for me.
AID00128081	How do I get her out of Gomorrah?
AID00128082	She'll have to go disguised. Gomorrah's packed around midnight and the bouncers won't notice just another patron leaving the joint.
AID00128083	Never mind, let's talk about Joana.
AID00128084	What about Joana?
AID00128085	I've noticed Legionaries prefer using machetes as weapons.
AID00128086	Caesar has taught us that over-reliance on firearms can only weaken us in the long run. It's why we train heavily with our blades and our fists.
AID00128087	Unlike an NCR trooper, a Legionary is always ready to fight regardless of the circumstance he finds himself in.
AID00128088	How are women treated around here?
AID00128089	We're property. If you're too young or too old, the men usually leave you alone. Usually.
AID00128090	We're property. If you're too young or too old, the men usually leave you alone. Usually.
AID00128091	You ought to be careful, yourself. I overheard some of the Legionaries talking about "trying you out."
AID00128092	What is your assignment?
AID00128093	I've been placed in charge of morale. It's difficult trying to keep spirits up with the Legion nearby.
AID00128094	In fact, there's more hope in wrangling Brahmin with my grandmother's stocking than inspiring these troopers.
AID00128095	Work for James Garret as an escort.
AID00128096	You could work off your debt.
AID00128097	How do you suggest Santiago does this?
AID00128098	Actually, I don't want anything.
AID00128099	I think 400 caps is a fair deal.
AID00128100	[FAILED] No deal, we agreed on less than that.
AID00128101	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
AID00128102	I think 400 caps is a fair deal.
AID00128103	[SUCCEEDED] We have a deal, then.
AID00128104	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
AID00128105	No need. Helping you was enough.
AID00128106	Really, you're one of a kind.
AID00128107	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
AID00128108	Goodbye.
AID00128109	Are you leaving... just like that?
AID00128110	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
AID00128111	Let's talk about my fee.
AID00128112	I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
AID00128113	It's my pleasure.
AID00128114	I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
AID00128115	About that competition.
AID00128116	Haven't started it yet. Are you interested to hear about it now?
AID00128117	You ready to participate?
AID00128118	Are you complaining?
AID00128119	No complaints. My assignment isn't easy but it's vital in keeping the troopers going.
AID00128120	In fact I have a new idea I'm confident will help morale. But if I told the troopers, it would likely fall on deaf ears.
AID00128121	I'd have better luck with the Legion's ears. Heh, get it? Legion ears?
AID00128122	I don't want to talk.
AID00128123	Let's talk about something else.
AID00128124	What's on your mind?
AID00128125	Here are some ears.
AID00128126	Woah boy! This puts you far ahead of everyone else. I think I'll have to declare you the winner of the competition.
AID00128127	It's not much, but here's a little something I scraped together for the winner of the contest. Good job, you earned it.
AID00128128	Oh man! Awesome! The competition is still going strong. Keep it up!
AID00128129	I don't know. It doesn't sound very good.
AID00128130	Come on. Lend me your ear. I bet you'll be good at it.
AID00128131	Hell yeah. Tell me about it.
AID00128132	Great. Since the camp is threatened by Legion, I propose a hunt. Kill any you encounter and bring me the Legion's ear as proof.
AID00128133	You get it? Legion ear?
AID00128134	Wow. Bringing up morale must be a difficult.
AID00128135	I'd call that an understatement.
AID00128136	But I can't complain. I'm not in the field as much as the others. I just stay here most of the day coming up with activities to occupy the camp.
AID00128137	Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to try. A killer competition to boost morale. Interested?
AID00128138	So there's no hope in Hope.
AID00128139	Ironic isn't it?
AID00128140	But it's understandable. The constant skirmishes take their toll on everyone in the end.
AID00128141	My help has a price.
AID00128142	200 caps will do.
AID00128143	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
AID00128144	My help has a price.
AID00128145	Whose doesn't, huh? Look, see Joana safely to Freeside and you'll cash in this favor, big time.
AID00128146	Why don't you get her out of Gomorrah?
AID00128147	What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
AID00128148	Besides, I step in Gomorrah and I'm as good as dead, you hear? You don't just leave the Omertas unless it's in a body bag.
AID00128149	Goodbye.
AID00128150	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
AID00128151	Like I always say, a polite society is an armed society.
AID00128152	<Lie and give 600 caps> I collected all of the debts.
AID00128153	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00128154	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00128155	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00128156	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00128157	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00128158	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00128159	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AID00128160	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AID00128161	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AID00128162	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AID00128163	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AID00128164	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AID00128165	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
AID00128166	Follow me.
AID00128167	Have you heard anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
AID00128168	About the shortage of Hydra right? We all have our own ways to deal with this place. Me, I sometimes walk at night. Calms the nerves.
AID00128169	I think Private Stone does the same thing.
AID00128170	Nevermind, I'll be back.
AID00128171	Then get the fuck out of here.
AID00128172	Okay. <Keep holdout weapons>
AID00128173	You'll get these back on your way out.
AID00128174	Here you go. <Hand over all weapons>
AID00128175	You'll get these back on your way out.
AID00128176	vGOMEntranceGreeting
AID00128177	Hey, no one but Omertas are allowed to carry guns into Gomorrah! Check your weapons with me.
AID00128178	Welcome back to Gomorrah. I know you're good for it, but you're still gonna have to leave your weapons with me.
AID00128179	That's all I need.
AID00128180	Glad to help.
AID00128181	What makes you think that?
AID00128182	I sometimes see him wandering around the camp. Though he seems to need more time to himself. His cot's still empty when I return after midnight.
AID00128183	Did you need anything else?
AID00128184	How's the morale doing?
AID00128185	The best it's been since the camp started. All because of you. So thanks, buddy!
AID00128186	It's showing improvement. Troopers aren't showing up late to their posts anymore.
AID00128187	Lower than a Feral Ghoul's IQ.
AID00128188	Maybe another time.
AID00128189	Yeah it was a crazy idea. Did you need anything else?
AID00128190	Sign me up.
AID00128191	Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
AID00128192	Can I help you with anything else?
AID00128193	Let's finish this.
AID00128194	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
AID00128195	You've got two choices. Live or die.
AID00128196	Let's finish this.
AID00128197	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
AID00128198	You've got two choices. Live or die.
AID00128199	Make it a 1000 caps. That's enough to betray the Omertas, no?
AID00128200	[FAILED] Do you think us inferior men, willing to sell their soul for scraps! Enough of this.
AID00128201	Time to die!
AID00128202	Right, loyalty is worth more than, say, a 1000 caps.
AID00128203	[SUCCEEDED] That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
AID00128204	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
AID00128205	A big profit. 500 caps would net you... well, lots of things, no?
AID00128206	[FAILED] Sorry, no deal. Our loyalty to the family is not for sale.
AID00128207	A big profit. 500 caps for you and your men to enjoy as you wish.
AID00128208	[SUCCEEDED] That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
AID00128209	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
AID00128210	I'm going... to, to deal with you first, yeah. That's it.
AID00128211	[FAILED] Time to die!
AID00128212	Leave us alone or I'll... I'll beat you and, yeah, your crew too, I think.
AID00128213	[FAILED] Time to die!
AID00128214	Good! Today I haven't had a chance to crush anyone to a pulp, yet.
AID00128215	[SUCCEEDED] I... I've got to make sure our boss hears about this! Otherwise you'd be dead.
AID00128216	Your crew? You mean those little men shaking like leaves behind you?
AID00128217	[SUCCEEDED] They're not... are they? Okay, I'll deal with them later, after I deal with you by myself!
AID00128218	Well, this is my... initiation test, to prove myself to the Omertas.
AID00128219	[FAILED] You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
AID00128220	Time to die!
AID00128221	I... I was hired to, you know, draw Carlitos out of hiding.
AID00128222	[FAILED] You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
AID00128223	Time to die!
AID00128224	Your boss kept it a secret. Carlitos would've not dealt directly with Omertas.
AID00128225	[SUCCEEDED] I see, yeah... he knows what we usually do to traitors. But all that profit is well worth sparing his miserable life.
AID00128226	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
AID00128227	Carlitos is trading what he stole for Joana. I was hired to see that he does.
AID00128228	[SUCCEEDED] All the dough!? Cachino once said this traitor flipped with thousands off the record. But, why wasn't I informed?
AID00128229	Your boss will hear about how you spoiled the mission.
AID00128230	What mission, what are you talking about?
AID00128231	Let's finish this.
AID00128232	Time to die!
AID00128233	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
AID00128234	Profit? What sort of profit do you have in mind that would compensate for your lives.
AID00128235	You've got two choices. Live or die.
AID00128236	Surrender. You don't seriously think that you can take on my crew, do you?
AID00128237	Your boss will hear about how you spoiled the mission.
AID00128238	What mission, what are you talking about?
AID00128239	Joana's dead.
AID00128240	Joana's dead.
AID00128241	No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
AID00128242	It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
AID00128243	He wanted to scare the NCR into retreating from this region - all to save lives.
AID00128244	The Chief should've known that the NCR is too stubborn to back down from anything, even when it's for the best.
AID00128245	While I'm glad it wasn't an enemy who was spreading lies and killing morale, I'm disappointed that a legend like the Chief felt he had to do it.
AID00128246	That's not important. It's over.
AID00128247	Whatever the Chief had in mind, I'm sure it was the right thing to do - even if it did end up scaring a lot of people in the process.
AID00128248	It's complicated. Hanlon caused the misinformation, but I convinced him to stop.
AID00128249	Wait... what? Why would he do that?
AID00128250	I've news about Heck Gunderson.
AID00128251	The young Gunderson's worth 500 caps, at least.
AID00128252	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
AID00128253	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128254	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00128255	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128256	The big Gunderson's worth 750 caps, at least.
AID00128257	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
AID00128258	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128259	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00128260	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128261	Goodbye.
AID00128262	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128263	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00128264	I don't charge for good deeds.
AID00128265	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128266	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00128267	Two Gundersons, that's worth a 1000 caps at least.
AID00128268	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
AID00128269	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128270	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AID00128271	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128272	I've got some questions for you.
AID00128273	Heck and Ted are dead.
AID00128274	Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
AID00128275	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00128276	Ted's dead.
AID00128277	Good work. I'm sorry that stupid mail-order cowboy ended like that but his father's misery makes it well worthy.
AID00128278	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00128279	You don't have to worry about Heck, ever again.
AID00128280	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
AID00128281	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
AID00128282	I've dealt with the Gundersons.
AID00128283	You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
AID00128284	You should know that Heck's dead.
AID00128285	Why was Heck such a threat to other ranchers?
AID00128286	People like Heck are rotten, kid, plenty of them in the Wasteland. They'll shoot you, kidnap your family, or drive NCR troops through your lands.
AID00128287	Whatever it takes to step over us honest folk is good enough in their book. Heck has bought NCR senators left and right, and then is even worse.
AID00128288	I have some questions for you.
AID00128289	You should know that Heck's dead.
AID00128290	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
AID00128291	All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
AID00128292	I'm not interested right now.
AID00128293	We do.
AID00128294	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00128295	Okay, 200 for information about Heck, right?
AID00128296	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00128297	I'm not interested right now.
AID00128298	We do.
AID00128299	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
AID00128300	We said 400 for information about Heck, right?
AID00128301	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
AID00128302	Goodbye.
AID00128303	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128304	I don't charge for good deeds.
AID00128305	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128306	Sounds good.
AID00128307	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128308	Goodbye.
AID00128309	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128310	I don't charge for good deeds.
AID00128311	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128312	Sounds good.
AID00128313	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128314	Goodbye.
AID00128315	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128316	Sounds good.
AID00128317	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
AID00128318	I don't charge for good deeds.
AID00128319	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
AID00128320	I need some injuries patched up.
AID00128321	Okay, what level of care do you require?
AID00128322	You look fine to me. I hope this isn't drug-seeking behavior... though I've never seen anyone get addicted to Stimpaks.
AID00128323	Carlyle St. Clair is dead.
AID00128324	Drat! He was our best chance at a fresh and healthy entree.
AID00128325	Without a replacement, I'll have to push back the whole affair. I can just see my rivals sneering at me.
AID00128326	I sent Carlyle St. Clair to come and speak with you.
AID00128327	Of his own volition? My goodness, you are very professional, aren't you? Well, he's sure to be a hit at our next banquet.
AID00128328	I trapped Carlyle St. Clair in the dumpster outside his house.
AID00128329	Just as I asked. What a magnificent relief! By now, barring any more bungling, my underlings should have him on his way here.
AID00128330	Talk to a man named Mortimer. He's looking for some big-name new members.
AID00128331	Yeah? Okay, maybe I will. Hell, anything's better than this. Thanks.
AID00128332	Joining the White Glove Society could clear your name. They're respected.
AID00128333	I've heard of them. Ultra-Luxe, right? Yeah, that'd be a step in the right direction. They'd never have me, though.
AID00128334	What's so bad about your reputation?
AID00128335	Oh, sure. That's all I need. Someone telling people around here about my reputation. I'll be run out of here before dawn. Forget it.
AID00128336	Never mind.
AID00128337	Whatever.
AID00128338	You. You don't seem like you fit in here.
AID00128339	That obvious, huh? Yeah I'm not from around here. But where I'm from, they don't want me, so that's just as well.
AID00128340	Really with my reputation, there aren't many places I can go that'll have me. My own family's blackballed me, and they've got a lot of clout.
AID00128341	Let's talk about something else.
AID00128342	Make it quick.
AID00128343	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
AID00128344	Are they back?
AID00128345	Did you know there's a nerve in your neck that helps you sleep? <Strike Nerve>
AID00128346	Ouch! What the hell? I don't think that did any-
AID00128347	Try breathing deeply three times and then blowing on your thumb.
AID00128348	Really? Is that some kind of ancient Chinese secret or something? Well, what the hell. I'll try anything once. Here goes...
AID00128349	I can get that out for you. <Apply Sleeper Hold>
AID00128350	Oh that feels nice. I can already feel myself rela...
AID00128351	You keep tilting your head to one side. Is your neck okay?
AID00128352	It's been stiff lately. Since I was attacked I've been afraid to sleep in my bed. I know it's irrational.
AID00128353	Now I can't hardly sleep at all. I just nod off from time to time. I'm so tired.
AID00128354	I'm just here to talk.
AID00128355	Yeah? What about?
AID00128356	Your naked body, stud. Go into the dumpster and I'll meet you after I change.
AID00128357	The dumpster? That's filthy!
AID00128358	I can't tell you how much that turns me on. Takes me back to my youth when I used to fool around with the help at our estate.
AID00128359	I shouldn't... but... it's been so long. And when is this ever gonna happen to me again? Okay, you're on. Don't keep me waiting, gorgeous.
AID00128360	Wouldn't putting St. Clair's body into a dumpster give it a terrible taste?
AID00128361	Not this one. Empty. I don't believe it's seen use since before the war.
AID00128362	And what would the point be, really? Who would pick up his trash if he used it?
AID00128363	But for our purposes, it should keep his body safe and hidden until my cohorts can recover it.
AID00128364	You earned your blade. Keep it.
AID00128365	You don't understand. I'll have to distinguish myself in battle to earn another. True to Caesar.
AID00128366	Why would I want a piece of shit machete?
AID00128367	That blade has split the heads of...  The only reason I give it to you is to force myself to earn another. True to Caesar.
AID00128368	I'll carry your blade with honor.
AID00128369	True to Caesar.
AID00128370	I'm going to kill everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00128371	A vow without action is breath across the lips, nothing more. True to Caesar.
AID00128372	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00128373	Nothing new to report, actually.
AID00128374	Then there's nothing for us to talk about. True to Caesar.
AID00128375	How can I help break the stalemate?
AID00128376	Why haven't you attacked the enemy?
AID00128377	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00128378	A glorious victory. You must be very satisfied.
AID00128379	I'll send word of your achievement. Perhaps Caesar will see fit to send another contubernium to occupy the Camp.
AID00128380	Here - take this, my blade. It was a gift from my Centurion upon the defeat of the Sun Dog tribe.
AID00128381	What's the situation here?
AID00128382	Goodbye.
AID00128383	True to Caesar.
AID00128384	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00128385	I've already killed everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00128386	I'll be on my way.
AID00128387	True to Caesar.
AID00128388	No offense intended. Carry on.
AID00128389	You are not my Centurion! You aren't even Legion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
AID00128390	True to Caesar.
AID00128391	Even if you are Legion, you are not my Centurion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
AID00128392	True to Caesar.
AID00128393	Sounds like fun. I'll be right back.
AID00128394	That remains to be seen.
AID00128395	I'll be on my way.
AID00128396	How can I help break the stalemate?
AID00128397	I'll be on my way.
AID00128398	How can I help break the stalemate?
AID00128399	You're demoralizing the enemy by leaving them alone?
AID00128400	I do not question Caesar's will! I do not second-guess!
AID00128401	I butchered this town. Those who weren't hacked limb from limb were forced to throw themselves from the cliffs. Three more, I have just crucified.
AID00128402	All this, in full view of the enemy's spotters to the north. Yes, our presence here demoralizes the enemy.
AID00128403	I'll be on my way.
AID00128404	How can I help break the stalemate?
AID00128405	What stalemate? It is Caesar's will that I hold this position - that I not advance.
AID00128406	If you're so eager to see Camp Forlorn Hope fall, why don't you go attack it all by yourself? Well?
AID00128407	Why haven't you attacked the enemy?
AID00128408	I have attacked the enemy. I led the assault on Nelson with two contubernia against twice our number.
AID00128409	It is Caesar's wish that we hold this position. Our mere presence this side of the Colorado humiliates and demoralizes the enemy.
AID00128410	I'll be on my way.
AID00128411	You have license to go where you please, at my will. True to Caesar.
AID00128412	I was in the area, that's all.
AID00128413	Not all of us have the luxury of coming and going as we please. Here, we stay put.
AID00128414	What's the situation here?
AID00128415	My orders are to hold Nelson. So far the enemy north of here has been too frightened to move against us. Why should it concern you?
AID00128416	I've got a better idea. How about I kill you and take my guns in anyways?
AID00128417	Buddy, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
AID00128418	Lady, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
AID00128419	Five words: From. My. Cold. Dead. Hands.
AID00128420	Them's the breaks. You want in, you don't bring the guns.
AID00128421	Why do you need my guns?
AID00128422	Security, baby. Can't make the bread if the bakers are full of lead, you dig it? Don't worry, you're safe as houses in here, courtesy of Mr. House.
AID00128423	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
AID00128424	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
AID00128425	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
AID00128426	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
AID00128427	Sure, here you go.
AID00128428	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
AID00128429	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
AID00128430	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
AID00128431	Yes, I'll do it.
AID00128432	I'll be going then.
AID00128433	Hey, hold on. Just so you know, if you go down into that camp, one of two things is gonna happen.
AID00128434	Either that little head of yours is gonna sail into the Colorado courtesy of a Legion machete or they're gonna try to make friends with you.
AID00128435	And if I find out you're friends with the Legion, I'll put a lump of lead through your skull soon as you pop it back up over the ridge. Are we clear?
AID00128436	Never mind. See you around.
AID00128437	Bye.
AID00128438	What can I do to help?
AID00128439	Nothing new to report on my end.
AID00128440	Then head back down into that camp and deal with the hostages.
AID00128441	Looks like I was able to get a few of the hostages out alive.
AID00128442	I have to admit, I didn't think you could do it. Guess that makes me the sap and you the hero.
AID00128443	I'm not authorized to pay for contract work, but here's something for the effort. And I'll make sure everyone hears about what you did. Thanks.
AID00128444	I put the captives out of their misery.
AID00128445	Dirty job, but I'm glad you did it. I'm not authorized to reward contract pay, but here's a little something for you.
AID00128446	And I'll let everyone know you did the right thing. Some people might not like it, but no one who matters. At least not as far as I'm concerned.
AID00128447	Sorry, not interested.
AID00128448	How about I rescue them instead?
AID00128449	Okay, I'll do it.
AID00128450	What would I have to do?
AID00128451	Sorry, not interested.
AID00128452	Can't you snipe the captives from up here?
AID00128453	What's playing at the Aces right now?
AID00128454	Where did you take my weapons?
AID00128455	Relax, baby, they're safe as houses. We'll keep them locked up in the bank upstairs, right next to the money. It's serious protection.
AID00128456	What is there to do here?
AID00128457	Everything your little heart desires, that's what. You like gambling? Boom. Either one of the main hallways has cards, slots, you name it.
AID00128458	Hungry? Thirsty? The restaurant just off the left-hand hallway has the best food and booze in Vegas.
AID00128459	Or maybe you'd rather take in a show? The Aces Theater upstairs always has hot acts raring to go. Check it out.
AID00128460	What's going on here?
AID00128461	Omerta business. Now fuck off, or else.
AID00128462	< Speech Option >
AID00128463	[SUCCEEDED] Shit. Look, we're just following orders. We, uh, need to take this up with the boss.
AID00128464	The Legion is watching out for this woman. Go ahead, cross them. I dare you.
AID00128465	[FAILED] Fuck the Legion. The NCR's got troops between us and them.
AID00128466	Kill her and Caesar's Legion will get you.
AID00128467	<Attack>
AID00128468	You have no idea who you're messing with!
AID00128469	Why can't you take care of this yourself?
AID00128470	I prefer to handle these matters through intermediaries such as yourself.
AID00128471	What's in it for me?
AID00128472	Besides the gratitude of the Legion? Don't worry, you'll be paid in coin or caps.
AID00128473	Was there something you needed me to do?
AID00128474	No, I do not require the "services" of a degenerate such as yourself.
AID00128475	There is a gambler, Martina Groesbeck, who has a knack for learning other people's secrets and passing that information along for a price.
AID00128476	The Omertas, who run Gomorrah, have become suspicious of Martina's frequent visits to their casino. Soon they'll pay her a visit of their own.
AID00128477	As I said before, Martina Groesback is a useful, if unwitting, source of information. The Omertas want her dead, while I need her alive.
AID00128478	I'd like to trade.
AID00128479	I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
AID00128480	I don't have any supplies to spare for someone with your spotted reputation, but buy your stuff for half the going rate.
AID00128481	Actually, I changed my mind.
AID00128482	Okay then.
AID00128483	No, thanks.
AID00128484	Okay then. Just try not to bleed all over the place, okay?
AID00128485	Fix me.
AID00128486	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel and a body bag, and we'll get started.
AID00128487	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00128488	Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
AID00128489	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
AID00128490	No, thanks.
AID00128491	Good luck to you then, junkie.
AID00128492	Yes, cure me.
AID00128493	Thanks, I'll fix you up right away.
AID00128494	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
AID00128495	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. Think about that next time you get high.
AID00128496	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
AID00128497	No, thanks.
AID00128498	Your loss, not mine. Let me know if your hair starts falling out.
AID00128499	Do it.
AID00128500	Okay, now this might hurt a bit...
AID00128501	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AID00128502	Well, let me know if you get some money before that third arm comes in.
AID00128503	I don't have 100 caps.
AID00128504	I need medical supplies.
AID00128505	Sorry. I'm low on supplies as it is and I don't have any to spare.
AID00128506	Can you heal my radiation?
AID00128507	Sure can. The sooner the better if you ask me, unless you want a third arm.
AID00128508	I need help with an addiction.
AID00128509	You and me both, but let's worry about you first. I can fix you up, if you know what I mean.
AID00128510	I have wounds that need mending.
AID00128511	You look fine to me. Well, as fine as anyone else around here.
AID00128512	I've seen worse, but I should be able to fix you up pretty easily.
AID00128513	Yeah, that looks pretty nasty.
AID00128514	This might take a miracle, and a lot of money.
AID00128515	I need medical treatment.
AID00128516	I don't have that many supplies left, so I can't offer my services freely, but I can help you.
AID00128517	Well, go somewhere else. You're not welcome here.
AID00128518	I'll consider it.
AID00128519	If you have to. I really don't see what there is to consider.
AID00128520	I'll check up on her for you.
AID00128521	Good. Martina frequents the Vault 21 Gift Shop, on the Strip. Hurry along, and she still may be in one piece by the time you get there.
AID00128522	I was able to convince the Omerta thugs that crossing the Legion was unwise.
AID00128523	Excellent. Had you simply killed them, the Omertas would've sent another group after Martina eventually.
AID00128524	You've saved me the trouble of coming up with a more permanent solution, and Martina is free to go about her business as usual. Well done.
AID00128525	Martina's safe, and the Omerta thugs sent after her are dead.
AID00128526	For now, anyway. She'll need to lay low while the Omertas are scrambling to find out what happened.
AID00128527	They'll eventually send more men after her, but I'm sure I'll come up with a better solution to the problem by then.
AID00128528	Do whatever you want. I just want to loot the room.
AID00128529	Deal.
AID00128530	Martina's dead.
AID00128531	I see. Was it ill fortune, or is Caesar's faith in you misplaced? Either way - it's done.
AID00128532	Hit me with a stimpak, Doc.
AID00128533	That should only take a few seconds if you've got the caps.
AID00128534	<Pay 10 caps>
AID00128535	There you go. Anything else?
AID00128536	Heal me up completely.
AID00128537	Stitching up lacerations and treating wounds will take some time. I'm going to need caps to get started.
AID00128538	I've got some wounds I need you to look at.
AID00128539	You look fine to me. I hope this isn't drug-seeking behavior... though I've never seen anyone get addicted to Stimpaks.
AID00128540	How have you been using the bathroom with your arms that messed up? Oh, forget I asked... phew.
AID00128541	I'm amazed you managed to limp here with your legs like that.
AID00128542	I didn't think red, purple, and swollen was your natural eye color. I can fix that right up.
AID00128543	Did a super mutant use your torso as a punching bag or something? I'm going to need more gauze...
AID00128544	Okay. This shouldn't take long, but I'm going to need some caps to cover supplies.
AID00128545	<Pay 50 caps>
AID00128546	You might want to brace yourself. This might get a bit painful.
AID00128547	<Pay 25 caps>
AID00128548	You might want to brace yourself. This might get a bit painful.
AID00128549	<Pay 75 caps>
AID00128550	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
AID00128551	<Pay 40 caps>
AID00128552	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
AID00128553	I could use another hit with a stimpak.
AID00128554	Just staple it all together. I'll fix my gimpy bits later.
AID00128555	This could take a while. Did you bring caps?
AID00128556	<Pay 50 caps>
AID00128557	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
AID00128558	<Pay 25 caps>
AID00128559	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
AID00128560	Why is your bodyguard allowed to have a gun?
AID00128561	Made me a special arrangement with the hotel. They want to do business with me, they got to play by my rules.
AID00128562	Lot of people out there resent success, might wanna take a swipe at me. This makes them think twice.
AID00128563	If I'd have been thinking, though, I'd have had him watching my boy instead. Then none of this would've happened.
AID00128564	TopsLonesomeDrifterPerformanceStrings
AID00128565	TopsBruceIsaacPerformanceStrings
AID00128566	TopsRadPackPerformanceStrings
AID00128567	I really can't do that.
AID00128568	Okay I will help you.
AID00128569	Sorry. I need to go.
AID00128570	Yes. But why does that matter to you?
AID00128571	I have no time to talk right now.
AID00128572	I'm going nowhere in particular.
AID00128573	VFSNCRFightPlayerPullsWeapon
AID00128574	VFSNCRFightKeepWeaponAway
AID00128575	You there! Keep your hands where we can see them! Draw a weapon and we will fire!
AID00128576	VFSNCRFightNoWeapons
AID00128577	Put your weapon away or we will fire!
AID00128578	VFSKingSendsPlayerToNegotiate
AID00128579	What is that fool doing? I need you to head out there and try to defuse the situation. Tell them I'm willing to cooperate.
AID00128580	VMS19PacerAttackingNews
AID00128581	King, we've got problems!
AID00128582	Lay it on me. What's going on?
AID00128583	There's a shootout going down near the train station. It's Pacer and some strangers. Might be NCR.
AID00128584	The man was attacked and driven off. He never arrived.
AID00128585	They said the man was severely beaten and barely survived.
AID00128586	Huh, that would explain why they're all riled at us. Seems like we have a big misunderst- what the hell?
AID00128587	Let's not act rashly here.
AID00128588	Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything uncalled for.
AID00128589	They said someone was sent to discuss the issue with you.
AID00128590	Wait a minute, wait a minute. They said what?
AID00128591	What are you going to do?
AID00128592	I'm gonna see that those supplies are distributed a little m- what the hell?
AID00128593	Why not?
AID00128594	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
AID00128595	It's no problem, just something I'd rather not think about. Now, I should get to the other customers.
AID00128596	Nothing, let's talk about something else.
AID00128597	Okay, what did you want to talk about?
AID00128598	Can you tell me anything else about them?
AID00128599	The King thinks those troops have been attacking Locals.
AID00128600	I know something's got them riled up, but I've been too busy with other matters to really look into it.
AID00128601	If you're looking into the matter, talk to Elizabeth. She's in charge of the operations here in Freeside, though she won't open up to you right away.
AID00128602	If Elizabeth holds out on you, tell her that I sent you. She should be a little more forthcoming if you mention my name.
AID00128603	Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
AID00128604	Do you know anything about NCR soldiers here in Freeside?
AID00128605	Only a little. A friend of mine, Major Elizabeth Kieran, has been handing out supplies to the poor a little west of here. What about it?
AID00128606	Thanks. This will keep me warm while I tell the story to the King.
AID00128607	Why you lit- You're just lucky I got something important to take care of. We'll settle this later.
AID00128608	You're right. He shouldn't be bothered with rumors right now.
AID00128609	Exactly. Seeing that we're of one mind on this, I'll head out. I got business to take care of.
AID00128610	I still think he should know about it.
AID00128611	That's a shame. Well, do what you want. Just don't expect it to matter.
AID00128612	Thanks. I suddenly forgot what I was going to tell the King.
AID00128613	Good, see that it stays that way. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
AID00128614	
AID00128615	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here's some more, but you better keep you mouth shut! I'm out of here. Got some important business to take care of.
AID00128616	That's a good start...
AID00128617	[FAILED] That's all you get. Now keep your mouth shut. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
AID00128618	That's it?
AID00128619	What's my silence worth to you?
AID00128620	You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, this should do it.
AID00128621	VMS19PacerIntercedes
AID00128622	Hey there, I heard that NCR soldier lady told you some wild story about them sending a messenger to us to work out some deal.
AID00128623	That's bullshit, and it's nothing to bother the King with. More like they sent someone to spy on us and he wasn't tough enough to last in Freeside.
AID00128624	So do everyone a favor and keep your mouth shut about it, okay?
AID00128625	That wasn't him. He didn't even know an envoy was sent.
AID00128626	Then he should watch his back. We know for a fact that the envoy made it to their headquarters.
AID00128627	Still, if the King's willing to deal with us, perhaps we can work something out. I'll tell my men to stand down.
AID00128628	I thought I'd save everyone some time and just kill you.
AID00128629	Wh-? Guards!
AID00128630	The King wants to help with the relief effort.
AID00128631	Like he helped the envoy we sent? No thanks.
AID00128632	Let me guess, something bad happened to the envoy.
AID00128633	The man was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
AID00128634	What happened?
AID00128635	Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
AID00128636	And the King refused?
AID00128637	In a manner of speaking. Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
AID00128638	I managed to get clearance to carry out the mission anyway, but with greatly reduced support.
AID00128639	Now there's not enough supplies to go around even if I wanted to serve the rest of Freeside, which I don't.
AID00128640	But that's all in the past now. I should get back to work. Say hi to Julie for me.
AID00128641	Julie Farkas told me to ask. She said it was important.
AID00128642	You know Julie? Not everyone in the NCR sees eye-to-eye with the Followers, but they're okay in my book, mostly because of her.
AID00128643	If you really want to know, we sent an envoy to the King offering to coordinate the relief effort.
AID00128644	Which are?
AID00128645	It's not something I'm willing to discuss. Now if you'll excuse me, there are other people waiting.
AID00128646	Why don't you serve Locals?
AID00128647	That's not really a pleasant topic of conversation. Let's just say we have our reasons.
AID00128648	No, I was just curious.
AID00128649	Well, now you know. Enjoy the food.
AID00128650	Yes, but I was afraid he wouldn't get served.
AID00128651	You were right, but here, take another helping for your friend. It'll be our secret.
AID00128652	Do you serve food to Locals as well?
AID00128653	No, I'm afraid we don't. Do you have a friend you wanted to bring in?
AID00128654	Like I said before, we don't. And I'm not inclined to discuss why.
AID00128655	It seemed fairly innocent.
AID00128656	Nothing's innocent in Freeside. You should know that by now.
AID00128657	No, I'm guessing they're doing something they know will cause a row, like keep the food all to themselves.
AID00128658	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
AID00128659	Can I ask you a few questions?
AID00128660	Sure can. What did you want to know?
AID00128661	I still haven't found anything.
AID00128662	Keep at it. Those boys are here for a reason.
AID00128663	They refuse to serve Locals.
AID00128664	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
AID00128665	They're only handing out supplies to NCR citizens.
AID00128666	I wanted to ask you some questions.
AID00128667	Go ahead. Throw some questions at me.
AID00128668	I'm still looking into the matter.
AID00128669	Then there's no sense in us talkin' about it.
AID00128670	The Local men were attacked by soldiers. One of the men was identified by rank.
AID00128671	Bunch of soldier boys, huh? They usually don't come around these parts since their big base is on the other side of the Strip.
AID00128672	If they're comin' over here now, it's got to be for a reason. I didn't want to believe the rumors that they're looking to take over Vegas, but now...
AID00128673	If something big is going down, I'm sure rumors of it will have spread. Ask around, particularly in the squatter areas where the NCR folk hang.
AID00128674	You might also mosey on over to the Mormon Fort and chat Julie Farkas up. The Followers tend to be in the know about these things.
AID00128675	Just don't ask her what to do about it. She'll probably ask you to hug someone or somethin'.
AID00128676	I'll look into it when I can.
AID00128677	Good. Return here when you've found something.
AID00128678	I'll head over right away.
AID00128679	Good. I like that enthusiasm. Return when you have some information we can use.
AID00128680	What are you serving?
AID00128681	Typically, I find it goes down better if I leave people guessing. So what do you say, want some?
AID00128682	Ah, not right now. Thanks.
AID00128683	You'll be back.
AID00128684	Sure. Serve me up something.
AID00128685	You won't regret it. At least until an hour or so from now.
AID00128686	VFSSimonDrunkComment
AID00128687	Here comes a winner. I'll let you handle this one.
AID00128688	VFSSimonLongDay
AID00128689	Settle in. You've got some hours left before your shift ends.
AID00128690	Stop bugging me.
AID00128691	Just doing my job, okay? Jeesh.
AID00128692	What does it involve?
AID00128693	How did you get enough money to enter The Strip?
AID00128694	This is important enough to the Followers that we scraped together the caps required for the credit check.
AID00128695	And I'm staying at Vault 21, which is pretty cheap. For the Strip, anyway.
AID00128696	Perhaps a bottle of Jacob's Absinthe might convince you?
AID00128697	Absinthe?! I haven't had a taste of that in decades!
AID00128698	If they keep bottles stocked at the Wrangler, you can count me in. I'll head that way and talk to Mr. Garret.
AID00128699	You'll be paid well, and room and board is on the house.
AID00128700	Not saying there wouldn't be advantages, especially if it'd let me start saving up my caps...
AID00128701	It's not like you'd be a slave. You'd get to choose your clients.
AID00128702	What's the difference?! Once you start working for the man, you gotta buy nice things to wear.
AID00128703	Then, you gotta make more money to afford the nice things. Seems like a right vicious cycle to get into.
AID00128704	Never mind.
AID00128705	Then, what do you want?
AID00128706	<Speech>
AID00128707	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. They do have a damn good selection of hooch over at the Wrangler.
AID00128708	If I get to choose my customers, if I get to be a little rough with them, if my cut is fair, and if I get that discount? That just might work.
AID00128709	Tell the Garrets I'll stop by to work out terms.
AID00128710	You'd be an independent - with a deep discount on the booze, maybe?
AID00128711	[FAILED] Take your best shot, sweetheart. That's all the action I need.
AID00128712	Let's face it... this is the only way you're going to get any action.
AID00128713	Turns out there are customers looking for someone just like you.
AID00128714	Weirdos into bullwhips and necrosis, eh? Doesn't sound half-bad...
AID00128715	What am I thinking? I'm no whore, and I ain't about to hand my ass over to some penny-ante hustler like he owns me.
AID00128716	When I say "escort," I mean "prostitute."
AID00128717	I'm all boot knives and leather, friend - and a ghoul, besides. What kind of weirdo wants what I've got?
AID00128718	This would be as an "escort."
AID00128719	I've escorted my share of idiot tourists around Freeside. Too much trouble for what it pays.
AID00128720	What do you know about the Van Graffs?
AID00128721	A couple of Radscorpions, those two. Gloria is the stable one, but she'd slit your throat if there's a profit in it.
AID00128722	Or rather she'd tell her brother to do it for her. Jean Baptiste is one of the sicker humans I've had the displeasure of observing.
AID00128723	What do you think of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00128724	I don't know how they do it. They're like saints, those Followers.
AID00128725	If they didn't charge for their services, I'd think they was crazy. But no, they're just naive. Warms your heart.
AID00128726	What's your opinion of Mr. House?
AID00128727	Before or after the human race shot itself in the foot? I been around long enough to have both opinions, see.
AID00128728	Before the war, Mr. House was a famous captain of industry - robotics, to be specific. Seemed charming in interviews, until he became a recluse.
AID00128729	Since the war, though? Didn't make a peep for near two hundred years - but when he came back, he came back strong and killed a lot of people.
AID00128730	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00128731	I reckon they care about getting water and electricity from the dam, and that's where it ends.
AID00128732	The locals here are just an inconvenience to them, something to step over or stomp down. They're here for the resources, plain and simple.
AID00128733	Let's talk about something else.
AID00128734	What did you want to know?
AID00128735	What about The Kings?
AID00128736	What about them? Pretty much the sort of gang you'd find anywhere else, just with better clothes.
AID00128737	The King himself, though? He's got that something special you can't put a finger on. Too bad he likes girls with skin.
AID00128738	Tell me about Freeside.
AID00128739	What starts in misery tends to stay there. Freeside wasn't Freeside until six or seven years ago.
AID00128740	That's when Mr. House's robots rolled out of the Lucky 38 and started pushing everyone who wouldn't join him off the Strip.
AID00128741	Lots of folks died. Some scattered to the winds. The rest wound up in Freeside and seem never to lose the habit of living like refugees.
AID00128742	I don't have the time right now.
AID00128743	I understand.
AID00128744	Are you the Legion's second-in-command?
AID00128745	No, Legate Lanius is Caesar's second. The Legate replaced the Burned Man after the Legion's defeat at the Dam several years ago.
AID00128746	Legate Lanius has not chosen anyone to be his second yet. It would be an honor to be selected, though.
AID00128747	What's your trick?
AID00128748	Sorry, but I can't tell you that. Trade secret.
AID00128749	No thanks.
AID00128750	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
AID00128751	You bet, I'm parched.
AID00128752	Best booze in Vegas, baby. What'll it be?
AID00128753	Just that Jean-Baptiste has Pacer's jet.
AID00128754	Like to live dangerously, do we? No problem. And... here you go.
AID00128755	I need a note written to Pacer from Jean-Baptiste Cutting.
AID00128756	Not a problem. I occasionally do business with the Van Graffs, so I have a sample of Mr. Cutting's handwriting around here somewhere.
AID00128757	What would you like it to say?
AID00128758	Can you forge a handwritten note for me?
AID00128759	Sure. Just tell me the author and what you want it to say.
AID00128760	Tell me about your siblings.
AID00128761	We're a wild bunch. There's my sister Frieda, who used to run this branch but took off to pursue "the opportunity of a lifetime", as she put it.
AID00128762	The rest are all long stories, and I don't got the time to tell them.
AID00128763	Tell me about the Van Graffs.
AID00128764	Our family comes from Redding, to the west. We deal weapons mostly, but trade other commodities, like gold, if there's cash in it.
AID00128765	Our mother's been running the show for longer than most of us have been alive, but she stays at the home office.
AID00128766	We've got branches all over the place, which are run by my brothers and sisters.
AID00128767	Momma's real popular with the menfolk, both for her money and her looks, which is why there's ten of us kids in total, all by different fathers.
AID00128768	Why don't you just kill him?
AID00128769	We could do that, but then we'd have to kill his four hundred friends too, and that'd just get tiring.
AID00128770	Some day he'll make a mistake, though, and his friends won't be around to back him up, and then he'll be mine.
AID00128771	I was thinking of raiding his jet stash.
AID00128772	Ha, he's a jet junkie? He'll go crazy when he finds it gone. I like it.
AID00128773	I'll tell you what. When you hit the stash, leave him this note from me. If the punk really has it bad, he'll come running straight here.
AID00128774	His gang won't be able to say shit if he comes storming this place himself.
AID00128775	
AID00128776	Yeah, you can blame Glory for that mess. She had some fun with the little prick and it ended badly.
AID00128777	Now he goes around spreading lies about my sister, which pisses me off. One of these days I'm going to piss in his skull, you watch.
AID00128778	I heard your family has a grudge against a King named Pacer.
AID00128779	I better go.
AID00128780	Then go bother someone else. I got shit to do.
AID00128781	Let's talk about something else.
AID00128782	Anything I can do to help?
AID00128783	Maybe. I'd like to know who I'm dealing with, first.
AID00128784	Is there anything you can tell me about the Legate?
AID00128785	He's the best warrior in the Legion. A full Legionary by the time he was 12, he's never lost a battle.
AID00128786	Had the Legate been in command during the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Legion would've won. I have no doubt about that.
AID00128787	Goodbye.
AID00128788	Goodbye.
AID00128789	Goodbye.
AID00128790	Goodbye.
AID00128791	Sorry Jacob, I haven't found those chems yet.
AID00128792	Please, find them soon. I can already feel the withdrawal effects taking hold.
AID00128793	Mr. House gets half of each day's take?
AID00128794	Yep, he makes the rules. It's steep, but it sure beats living in North Vegas. Here on the Strip I can afford to eat, and no one tries to kill me.
AID00128795	Do you work for one of the casinos?
AID00128796	Nope, strictly independent. Well... kind of independent.
AID00128797	To vend anything here on the Strip, you got to register with one of those police robots and sign a franchisee agreement.
AID00128798	At the end of each day, you keep half of what you made. The rest, you hand over to those bots - and they know if you're cheating.
AID00128799	<Lie> Well Nero didn't tell me any of this when he convinced me to take you out.
AID00128800	The fuck? I knew there had to be someone higher up helping you. Nero, you backstabbing, two-timing motherfucker. I knew this day would come.
AID00128801	So, are you... paying me for this?
AID00128802	[FAILED] Oh. No that wasn't really what we had in mind. We were hoping you would just, you know, help us. To be helpful.
AID00128803	Dr. &PCName; diagnoses a terminally low discussion of caps in this conversation.
AID00128804	[SUCCEEDED] Ah. I see. I suppose I can give you some medical supplies for your efforts. I assure you they will be worth plenty of caps.
AID00128805	I have to go.
AID00128806	Oh... okay. I'll be around if you change your mind.
AID00128807	Because I don't give a shit about the Followers or anyone else in this dump.
AID00128808	Great. You and every other asshole around here. If you grow a heart anytime soon, I'll be around.
AID00128809	I don't want to abuse Mr. House's trust.
AID00128810	Well... I guess that makes some sense. After all, you're the first person who's set foot in there in over two hundred years.
AID00128811	Let me know if you change your mind. I'll be around here or in Vault 21.
AID00128812	I'm not interested.
AID00128813	Do you mind if I ask why?
AID00128814	Yep, let's rock.
AID00128815	All right, this is going to be fun.
AID00128816	Sorry, no one parts me from my weapons.
AID00128817	You sure you want it to go down this way? You're going to have every Omerta in this place jumping down your throat.
AID00128818	VMS18SecuritronHeckDeathReaction
AID00128819	Stand back, citizens. Deceased bodies are a known source of illness, and a potential tripping hazard.
AID00128820	VMS18SecuritronArrestHeck
AID00128821	Heck Gunderson, you are under arrest for the murder of Ted Gunderson.
AID00128822	What in blazes? That's my son you're talking about! He ain't dead. I'm looking for him.
AID00128823	It is my duty to inform you that murder is a serious crime.
AID00128824	As a murderer you should be feeling emotions such as guilt, sorrow, and shame.
AID00128825	If not, you may wish to consult a mental health professional.
AID00128826	Where's my son? What'd you do with my boy?
AID00128827	I hope this experience has taught you an important lesson about the value of human life.
AID00128828	You can't do this to me! This is a mistake!
AID00128829	Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
AID00128830	Please allow me to escort you to the nearest criminal processing facility.
AID00128831	The hell I will.
AID00128832	About that favor you owe me...
AID00128833	Ask away.
AID00128834	Tell me again about Michael Angelo.
AID00128835	Tell me again about Michael Angelo.
AID00128836	He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
AID00128837	Who is Michael Angelo?
AID00128838	What is there to do around here?
AID00128839	Feel free to head to our club, Brimstone, or you can see our gorgeous courtyard out behind the casino.
AID00128840	Feel free to head to our club, Brimstone, or you can see our gorgeous courtyard out behind the casino.
AID00128841	Do you have any rooms available?
AID00128842	Sorry, we don't have any hotel rooms available right now, but feel free to gamble or help yourself to our other services.
AID00128843	Sorry, we don't have any hotel rooms available right now, but feel free to gamble or help yourself to our other services.
AID00128844	Not good enough.
AID00128845	I'm afraid that's all I can offer. Well, I won't keep you any longer.
AID00128846	Let me know if you change your mind. The offer for medical supplies will still be good.
AID00128847	All right. I'll do it.
AID00128848	Great. I'll have the medical supplies for you by the time you come back.
AID00128849	Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
AID00128850	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
AID00128851	Sorry, not interested.
AID00128852	I left one of my companions in the freezer for your enjoyment.
AID00128853	Wonderful. You have come through with flying colors. On behalf of my colleagues, allow me to extend my thanks.
AID00128854	I know what a terrible sacrifice this must've been for you.
AID00128855	I've got a message for you, from Carlitos.
AID00128856	I could probably find a use for some of this meat.
AID00128857	Is the dead Brahmin contagious?
AID00128858	What happened to this Brahmin?
AID00128859	Have you actually tried that?
AID00128860	It's a long story. Let's just say whiskey makes you do strange things to impress a girl.
AID00128861	But it also leads to some of my best competition ideas. Wanna hear one?
AID00128862	For some reason I don't believe you.
AID00128863	I don't care what you believe. Now unless there's something else, why don't you just buzz off.
AID00128864	I sometimes do the same thing.
AID00128865	Yeah, nothing strange about a late night stroll. Everybody does it.
AID00128866	Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what's really going on?
AID00128867	[FAILED] Nothing's going on, so just mind your own business.
AID00128868	I know what's really going on. You can trust me.
AID00128869	[SUCCEEDED] Well... sometimes I sneak into the medical tent at night and "borrow" some of the medical supplies.
AID00128870	But it's not what you think. I can explain everything. Just hear me out.
AID00128871	Private Sexton mentioned you wander around the camp at night.
AID00128872	I do what now? Uhh... I mean, yeah, I sometimes need to... stretch my legs. Helps me... uh... think.
AID00128873	Then why did I find this empty syringe in your pocket?
AID00128874	Holy shit! How the hell did you find that?
AID00128875	Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
AID00128876	People using Hydra have their skin turn purple, right?
AID00128877	[FAILED] Good god, no. Look, don't worry about symptoms, just ask around and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious.
AID00128878	What are the symptoms of Hydra use?
AID00128879	[SUCCEEDED] Excessive use causes dilated eyes, an increased heart rate and blood pressure, massive sweating, you know... the usual.
AID00128880	I'll just keep bugging you until you say yes, you know.
AID00128881	< Speech Option >
AID00128882	I'm not exactly a friend of the Legion, you know.
AID00128883	I can't help you right now.
AID00128884	Just those? You calling me weak? I'll show you weak!
AID00128885	And what would you need me for?
AID00128886	Armed? Look at these biceps!
AID00128887	What are you doing out here alone?
AID00128888	Sgt. Reyes sent me - she's curious about the high casualties at this station.
AID00128889	"High casualties?" We've had one broken ankle, but nobody at this post has died.
AID00128890	What are you doing out here?
AID00128891	Keeping watch on the river and looking for anyone trying to cross it. The Legion likes to send infiltration teams over on rafts.
AID00128892	You filed a report which said Legion Super Mutants wiped out an NCR patrol.
AID00128893	No, I didn't. You might hear that kind of nonsense from a drunk trooper on the Strip, but not from me. The Legion doesn't have Super Mutants.
AID00128894	That patrol was wiped out by its own incompetence - a couple of the troopers were fooling around with a grenade when it went off.
AID00128895	Let's talk about something else.
AID00128896	Alright. What do you want to know?
AID00128897	Let's go back to my previous questions.
AID00128898	Okay, what's on your mind?
AID00128899	Must have been rough.
AID00128900	You have no idea. It was a fierce battle. Lots of people died.
AID00128901	Anyone with medical training had their hands full for weeks after the battle was finally over.
AID00128902	During that time I saw quite a few things I wouldn't mind forgetting about.
AID00128903	Tell me about the first battle.
AID00128904	The Legion attacked in full force. Chief Hanlon had the troopers fall back pulling the enemy in, before entrenching into secure positions.
AID00128905	The Legion got bogged down and Rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters started taking out the Legion officers.
AID00128906	They sent their best men to stop the Rangers and 1st Recon, but the Rangers pulled them into a trap at Boulder City and blew them all to hell.
AID00128907	After that the Legion's forces were in disarray and tried to retreat. However, our forces advanced rapidly and routed them. And that was that.
AID00128908	What's your take on the NCR?
AID00128909	My take? I try not to think about it, I got enough on my hands here.
AID00128910	What do you know about Hoover Dam?
AID00128911	Quite a bit actually. I was stationed nearby during the first battle of Hoover Dam four years ago. I saw a lot of what happened firsthand.
AID00128912	Tell me about yourself.
AID00128913	I used to be a doctor back in California, but a few years back I got suckered into doing military work because it was my "patriotic duty."
AID00128914	Back then, I, like many idealistic men before me, thought it was a great idea and was excited about making the world a better place with the NCR.
AID00128915	Now... I just want to get back home. I've had enough fighting and fixing up soldiers just to send them right back out to die to last a lifetime.
AID00128916	Whatever it is, I think you need it more than I do.
AID00128917	I'm not going to argue with you there. Thanks, I appreciate this.
AID00128918	Thanks, I appreciate it.
AID00128919	You're welcome. Enjoy.
AID00128920	Who were you looking for? Come on, you can tell me. Please?
AID00128921	[FAILED] Drop it. Now why the hell are you here?
AID00128922	If you're looking for someone in particular, I could tip you off if I see them.
AID00128923	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, well, you see anybody wearing Legion crimson or a lot of sports equipment, you just let me know.
AID00128924	You still haven't answered my question.
AID00128925	Skip the puns. What is this idea you have?
AID00128926	Straight to the point. I like that. What I propose is a Legion hunt. Troopers kill them anyway so why not make it a game. What do you say?
AID00128927	I can't believe you just said that.
AID00128928	That bad huh? Well at least I tried. The actual idea is better. It's a Legion hunt. Whoever kills the most wins. How about it?
AID00128929	I'll be back later. Don't go running off anywhere.
AID00128930	Where would I go? My caravan is lost and I haven't the caps to do much else.
AID00128931	Who are you?
AID00128932	I haven't the time to speak to commoners such as yourself.
AID00128933	Goodbye.
AID00128934	Goodbye.
AID00128935	I still don't know.
AID00128936	Know what? I'm going to sign you up anyway. If you don't mind being last then there's not much else I can say. Any questions?
AID00128937	I love fighting. I'm going back out there now.
AID00128938	Well don't let me stop you then.
AID00128939	Skip the jokes. I'm in.
AID00128940	Count me out.
AID00128941	That's a shame. Well if you change your mind, let me know. Need anything else?
AID00128942	Sign me up.
AID00128943	Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
AID00128944	Can I help you with anything else?
AID00128945	That's hilarious. You think of it on your own?
AID00128946	Yep. Been waiting for a chance to use it. So can I count you in?
AID00128947	That is the stupidest joke I've heard.
AID00128948	Yeah it was bad. I'll leave the comedy alone. So how about it?
AID00128949	I'll kill you for asking.
AID00128950	Alright calm down buddy. I don't wanna provoke you. I'll let you ask the questions.
AID00128951	I couldn't care less.
AID00128952	Alright fine. Is there anything you do care about?
AID00128953	Okay you talked me into it.
AID00128954	Of course I will be. I'm the best at everything.
AID00128955	Goodbye.
AID00128956	Go.
AID00128957	I just want to know.
AID00128958	The better we understand each other, the more effective we'll be.
AID00128959	All right.
AID00128960	You're hiding something. Spit it out. You owe me.
AID00128961	Fine. How do I know she's dead? Here it is.
AID00128962	She... I tracked her down. Southeast, near the river. They were selling her. Saw it through my scope.
AID00128963	Whole place swarming with Legion. Hundreds of them. Bidding for things no man has a right to.
AID00128964	I just had my rifle with me. Just me, against all of them, so... I took the shot.
AID00128965	I think it's time you told me what happened to your wife.
AID00128966	I don't see what this helps. She's dead.
AID00128967	You're right. I was out of line.
AID00128968	It's just something I'm not ready to discuss. With you or anybody.
AID00128969	I want to understand you better.
AID00128970	You don't know what you're asking. Just... let it go for now.
AID00128971	The Legion's the only thing I want on my mind right now.
AID00128972	I don't feel like I can trust you.
AID00128973	That goes both ways. I joined up with you to kill legionaries. Sooner we get back to that, sooner we can have an understanding.
AID00128974	What is it you aren't telling me about what happened to your wife?
AID00128975	You got no right asking me that. Drop it.
AID00128976	I found all the evidence you'll need from Saint James' and Dermot's rooms. Here.
AID00128977	Let's see... a bear. Yes, this belonged to the little girl, so that's a direct connection to the missing people.
AID00128978	And this ledger - I know these names. Nephi and Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
AID00128979	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
AID00128980	Any ideas what to look for?
AID00128981	We need a direct connection to the refugees, now that we've got an idea of what happened to them. Saint James could have something in his room.
AID00128982	Any ideas what to look for?
AID00128983	We know there's a connection with the refugees, but we need to know where they could be found. There could be more evidence in Dermot's room.
AID00128984	I'll keep looking.
AID00128985	All right. Maybe Saint James has something connected to the refugees as well.
AID00128986	I'll keep looking.
AID00128987	All right. Maybe Dermot's got something, as well.
AID00128988	Proof enough. Let's talk about my reward.
AID00128989	I found this evidence in their rooms - they attacked when I confronted them.
AID00128990	Those sick bastards - can't say I'll shed any tears for them. Here, you've earned this.
AID00128991	Saint James and Dermot were behind it. They're dead now.
AID00128992	How do you know? Did you find proof?
AID00128993	And yet you know the missing people are refugees.
AID00128994	I didn't mention Aerotech.
AID00128995	Yeah, well, I must've heard rumors, and, uh... fuck you! You got nothing on me and Dermot.
AID00128996	Goodbye.
AID00128997	Yeah, fuck off.
AID00128998	
AID00128999	I heard, we'll be needing those guns. Word on the street is you handled those Fiend freaks like a real pro.
AID00129000	I helped Troike out, like you asked.
AID00129001	Yeah, I heard. I wasn't sold on the whole gas thing. He's the expert though. It sounds like this chlorine thing is going to work out real well.
AID00129002	I finished that work for Clanden.
AID00129003	I heard you did some good work for us. Thank you. Here's a little cash from us to you. Try not to spend it all in one place.
AID00129004	I finished all the work you had for me.
AID00129005	What do you do here?
AID00129006	Um... I help take care of the Brahmin. I sometimes bring water and food to people. Um... that's it.
AID00129007	I changed my mind. I'll save your squad.
AID00129008	Really? I can't thank you enough. I'll wait here and watch the road. Good luck in there.
AID00129009	The odds are too small. You're on your own.
AID00129010	There's no way I can take on the Legion by myself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
AID00129011	Alright. It can't hurt to try.
AID00129012	Extra encouragement would also increase their chances.
AID00129013	[SUCCEEDED] I understand. Here's what I have on me. Now go before it's too late.
AID00129014	[FAILED] This is an emergency. How can you be asking for payment?
AID00129015	You sure they're still alive?
AID00129016	There's a slim chance. But if the Legion wanted us dead, our heads would already be on pikes.
AID00129017	I'll take a look and see if there's anything I can do.
AID00129018	That's already more than I was expecting. I'll keep watch to make sure no more Legion come up the road. Good Luck.
AID00129019	I'm busy right now.
AID00129020	If you want to be that way I'll leave you alone.
AID00129021	Why are you out here alone?
AID00129022	My squad was ambushed by a Legion party lead by that bastard Alexus.
AID00129023	He was taking us into the mine up ahead, but I managed to get away. I need help to get them out.
AID00129024	VHDKimballSpeech01
AID00129025	Thank you, Colonel Moore. And thank you, my fellow Californians, who have come so far to answer the call to service put forth by the republic.
AID00129026	It is for you that I have come here, and it is because of you that I am able to do so.
AID00129027	We enjoy our privileges because you take the greatest of risks and are prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices.
AID00129028	It is because of men and women like Private First Class Jeremy Watson that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.
AID00129029	Born in a tin shack on the outskirts of One Pine, Jeremy Watson never had it easy.
AID00129030	His father worked as a caravan guard on the Short Loop, and his mother, like many Californians, braved the ruins of the Old World as a prospector.
AID00129031	They suffered through water shortages, raider attacks, and the Brotherhood War. Like our mighty Sierra Nevadas, they endured.
AID00129032	But the time came when they could no longer shoulder the burden alone.
AID00129033	Twelve years ago, they called out for help, and the republic heard them. Troopers and rangers, just like you, answered the clarion call.
AID00129034	Men and women stepped forward to say, "I will carry the weight."
AID00129035	And at Owen's Lake, we made true on our promise, driving out the raider tribes to establish a lasting peace in the eastern Sierra Nevadas.
AID00129036	We carried the weight, and though we left behind many of our brothers and sisters on that battlefield, it did not break us.
AID00129037	Ten years ago, Chief Elise met with representatives of the Desert Rangers to discuss terms of what would become the Ranger Unification Treaty.
AID00129038	The treaty was more than a resolution to welcome the Desert Rangers into the republic.
AID00129039	It was a covenant to protect southern Nevada against Caesar's Legion and the tyranny of his regime.
AID00129040	There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting?  What is Nevada to us?"
AID00129041	Sometimes we forget that the light of our society shines beyond our borders.
AID00129042	Sometimes we take those privileges for granted that our forebears fought so hard to achieve.
AID00129043	We must always remember that wherever Californians stand, we carry our principles with us:
AID00129044	equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic.
AID00129045	This was the same fire that burned in the heart of the Old World that preceded us.
AID00129046	We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.
AID00129047	When the republic called on the men and women of California to carry that fire across the Mojave, Jeremy Watson answered. You answered.
AID00129048	Together, you carried the weight. And when PFC Watson's platoon came under attack at Forlorn Hope, he took the greatest risk,
AID00129049	not only for his fellow Californians, but for California itself.
AID00129050	He was prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices, to defend the principles of our republic, even here, on Nevada soil.
AID00129051	His actions are a beacon to all of us who stand here today in tribute to his valor.
AID00129052	Private First Class Jeremy Watson, on behalf of the senate and people of the New California Republic,
AID00129053	it is my honor to present you with the Star of Sierra Madre.
AID00129054	Not far from this spot, a monument stands as a tribute to the sacrifice made by those who came before us,
AID00129055	the men and women who fulfilled the promise we made to the Desert Rangers.
AID00129056	Its back is inscribed with the names of the troopers and rangers who carried the weight.
AID00129057	And because they made the most noble of sacrifices, it did not break us.
AID00129058	Four years ago, we held this dam. Four years ago, we carried the weight.
AID00129059	Four years ago, we drew a line through the Mojave as clear as the Colorado River, a line that Caesar cannot cross.
AID00129060	Today, you stand here with our brothers and sisters to hold that line. Today, you honor all Californians by carrying that weight.
AID00129061	Today, you are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. You are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring.
AID00129062	You are the great western light of California, torchbearers in the darkness, living reminders of all that is best in our republic.
AID00129063	Thank you. Thank you.
AID00129064	Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell are you waiting for? You think I want to get shot?  Let's go!
AID00129065	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
AID00129066	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
AID00129067	If this is a trap, I'm going to take a lot of you with me.
AID00129068	The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
AID00129069	Why does Caesar want to see me?
AID00129070	Go to him, and you will understand.
AID00129071	VHDKimballSpeech02
AID00129072	Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for coming out here today for this very special occasion.
AID00129073	It is my pleasure to introduce to you. The President of the New California Republic, Aaron Kimball!
AID00129074	How do you know your punishment isn't over?
AID00129075	Because I'm still alive.
AID00129076	If it's out of your control, why worry about it?
AID00129077	Yeah, that's what I thought, too.
AID00129078	But it's not so easy when you know it's coming for you.
AID00129079	Life doesn't work that way. Your misfortunes are just bad luck.
AID00129080	That's what they tell you in the casinos, too. Because it's the only way to get you to buy back in.
AID00129081	If people knew the truth, that something's watching you, waiting to take it all away from you, and it never loses...
AID00129082	That's all it's doing now. Waiting for me to buy back in.
AID00129083	Maybe you can make up for your mistakes.
AID00129084	A murderer who does good deeds is still a murderer. And he'll still get his judgment.
AID00129085	I left the NCR when my tour was up. Had enough of war. Decided I was gonna start over.
AID00129086	None of it made a difference in the end.
AID00129087	It is because of Bitter Springs that you think you've got bad things coming?
AID00129088	Life has a way of punishing you for the mistakes you make.
AID00129089	Big enough mistake, punishment can take a while.
AID00129090	Mine's not over.
AID00129091	Being a mindless drone is just as dangerous. You have to think for yourself.
AID00129092	Not much hope either way, is there?
AID00129093	That's true. You can't second guess what you do out there.
AID00129094	It doesn't lead anywhere that does any good. I know that much.
AID00129095	Sounds like you have some regrets.
AID00129096	You don't come out of a tour of duty without regrets. It's best just not to think about it.
AID00129097	There must be more to it than that.
AID00129098	Not as much as you'd think.
AID00129099	Must've been one hell of a miscommunication.
AID00129100	Yeah, well. That's how they wrote it up in the report.
AID00129101	Sounded like more of a massacre.
AID00129102	Yeah. I guess that'd be the word.
AID00129103	We did what we were there to do. Lot of people got killed. That's war.
AID00129104	Maybe looking back you'd do things differently, but that's not how it works.
AID00129105	In the field, you hesitate, you or someone you care about will die. They teach that from day one.
AID00129106	You want me to make good on my promise to fight the Legion with you, is that it?
AID00129107	I don't know. Couldn't hurt.
AID00129108	Tell me about it.
AID00129109	How can you say that? We've been fighting together.
AID00129110	Your enemies, or mine?
AID00129111	True. It's a start.
AID00129112	I've seen my share of terrible things. You can talk to me about it.
AID00129113	Maybe some other time.
AID00129114	That's it? You won?
AID00129115	Look, we've done some traveling together, but we're not exactly comrades-in-arms. I'm not ready to swap war stories.
AID00129116	You must've been at Bitter Springs. What happened there?
AID00129117	That part of my life is over now. So is this discussion.
AID00129118	We won.
AID00129119	There was a... miscommunication.
AID00129120	Were you at Bitter Springs with First Recon?
AID00129121	I was in a lot of places with First Recon. I don't really remember.
AID00129122	You're not going to tell me?
AID00129123	No. Sorry.
AID00129124	Let's talk about something else.
AID00129125	All right.
AID00129126	I don't understand.
AID00129127	Better that you don't.
AID00129128	Why do you think you've got bad things coming?
AID00129129	Because fair is fair.
AID00129130	You make it sound like your wife's death was inevitable.
AID00129131	It was gonna be something. If I'd never met Carla, it would've been something else. I should've never gotten close to her.
AID00129132	I've got bad things coming to me. You'd better keep your distance, too.
AID00129133	You had no right to make that decision.
AID00129134	There was no decision. I was meant to pull that trigger. It was a mistake to think I could escape it.
AID00129135	You take out a debt, it's only a matter of time before someone comes collecting. Things just finally caught up with me.
AID00129136	You should've tried to rescue her. Even if it meant your death.
AID00129137	There was never any saving her. They'd have taken her where I couldn't follow. What I did... that was the only rescue.
AID00129138	Better for her to die than live a Legion slave.
AID00129139	Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death. There was no choice in what I did.
AID00129140	It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
AID00129141	All this was only ever going to play out one way. It still is. I don't have any say. All I can do is wait for it to be done with me.
AID00129142	It's your own damn fault. Help them yourself.
AID00129143	DELETE THIS
AID00129144	I'm ready to travel with you.
AID00129145	The trip will take a few hours. Take your place on the boat.
AID00129146	What'll happen at the Fort?
AID00129147	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AID00129148	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. Not even tribal chieftains receive this honor.
AID00129149	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AID00129150	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. That it'd be a woman is even more surprising.
AID00129151	Will you pay a bounty for NCR troops I kill?
AID00129152	The killing of Profligates should never go unrewarded. I'll pay you a small sum per tag.
AID00129153	<BARTER, player asks to use dog tags as currency for supplies>
AID00129154	[SUCCEEDED] Go see Decanus Severus when you have tags, in that case. He watches over our stores.
AID00129155	If you trade me ammo and supplies instead, I can stay in the area, racking up kills.
AID00129156	[FAILED] Nothing on this Earth could make you worthy to wear the armor of a Centurion. Do not ask again.
AID00129157	How many dog tags to get your helmet?
AID00129158	I'll come back when I've made some kills.
AID00129159	Yes, stop wasting my time.
AID00129160	One.
AID00129161	Killing one Profligate is the work of a child.
AID00129162	Two.
AID00129163	Just two?
AID00129164	Three.
AID00129165	So you're getting some exercise.
AID00129166	Here, take all the dog tags I've got.
AID00129167	A good bit of hunting. Here's your payment.
AID00129168	Five.
AID00129169	Hardly a day's work, but then again, you're not Legion.
AID00129170	Never mind.
AID00129171	Was there something else you wanted to bother me with?
AID00129172	I have more to turn in.
AID00129173	That's all for now.
AID00129174	What is this place?
AID00129175	This is the Bitter Springs refugee camp. We've been maintaining it for a few years now, ever since Caesar's Legion started seriously pushing west.
AID00129176	Most of the people here were displaced by the Legion's advance. At first there weren't many, but lately it's been more than we can handle.
AID00129177	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer you much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
AID00129178	Are things going better at the camp now?
AID00129179	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. Thank you again.
AID00129180	How are things around the camp?
AID00129181	What can I do to help?
AID00129182	At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
AID00129183	As if that wasn't enough, someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
AID00129184	At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
AID00129185	Someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
AID00129186	Captain Gilles said to talk to you about medical aid for the camp.
AID00129187	Hey, if you can help, I'll take whatever I can get. Doctor's Bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
AID00129188	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
AID00129189	What I really need are medical texts - books on psychology or pediatrics, specifically.
AID00129190	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AID00129191	What I really need is a book on psychology. Something for post-traumatic stress.
AID00129192	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AID00129193	What I really need is a book on pediatric medicine. We've got a lot of sick and injured kids here.
AID00129194	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AID00129195	Doctor's bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
AID00129196	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
AID00129197	What kind of aid were you looking for again?
AID00129198	I found one of those books you wanted.
AID00129199	Both of them? Wow, that's very resourceful. Thank you.
AID00129200	I found those books you wanted.
AID00129201	That's great! Thank you. I'm sure this will go a long way toward making things better here.
AID00129202	This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you.
AID00129203	I found another book for you.
AID00129204	Why is the flag upside down?
AID00129205	Of course I'm aware. It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
AID00129206	It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
AID00129207	Goodbye.
AID00129208	Well enough. Be on your way.
AID00129209	CaptainGillesRadioactiveSuppliesScience
AID00129210	[SUCCEEDED] We do have some spare Rad-X in the supply tent. That might work. Thank you.
AID00129211	These supplies are irradiated, but if we filter them with Rad-X they'll be safe.
AID00129212	[FAILED] You know, I appreciate the help but... we'll pass on those. Thanks.
AID00129213	These supplies are radioactive, so swallow lots of lead before you eat them.
AID00129214	<Lie, give radioactive supplies> These supplies should be "helpful." Enjoy them.
AID00129215	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. This will be a tremendous help.
AID00129216	<Give 1 Doctor's Bag> I brought you a Doctor's Bag. I hope it helps.
AID00129217	Are you kidding? The supplies in this are going to save lives. Thank you.
AID00129218	My friend here is a doctor, maybe he could give you some training in those areas instead.
AID00129219	Yeah? Hey, sure, that would be fantastic!
AID00129220	I'll keep my eyes open for books on pediatrics or psychological trauma, then.
AID00129221	Thank you. Any help you can give would be a godsend.
AID00129222	Medical texts? Aren't you a doctor?
AID00129223	I'm an Army field medic. I can treat bullet wounds, shrapnel, trenchfoot, no problem.
AID00129224	But this - the kids and the psychological trauma and all the rest - is out of my league.
AID00129225	I found this supply cache in a cave up the mountain. Maybe it will help.
AID00129226	Where did you get these? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. These will be a tremendous help.
AID00129227	I found these supply caches in some caves up the mountain. Maybe they'll help.
AID00129228	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't completely solve our problems, but it goes a long way.
AID00129229	Again, thank you, this is a huge help.
AID00129230	I found another supply cache for the camp.
AID00129231	I'd like to ask about something else.
AID00129232	Okay, but make it quick - I'm very busy here.
AID00129233	What's this about someone killing refugees?
AID00129234	It started about six months ago. At first it was just supplies going missing - we figured it was refugees. Then people started dying.
AID00129235	Always a single bullet to the head, always from extreme range. We've lost eight refugees and three soldiers to this son of a bitch.
AID00129236	We know he must be hiding out in one of the caves up in the mountains, but I don't have enough men to send out looking for him!
AID00129237	How can I help with medical supplies?
AID00129238	You'll want to talk to Lieutenant Markland about that, he's our medical officer. He should be down at the medical tent now.
AID00129239	What kind of supplies?
AID00129240	Food, blankets, clothes, tools. The army used to ship out caches of supplies regularly, but with the Legion so active we haven't gotten any in months.
AID00129241	Where would you get new troops from?
AID00129242	I don't know. The NCR's stretched thin as it is. I've put in requests at Camp Golf, Forlorn Hope, McCarran - but things are no better there.
AID00129243	Maybe if their situations improved, they'd have men to spare. Or maybe they'd listen to someone with a reputation for helping the NCR.
AID00129244	Wanted to ask some questions about the outpost.
AID00129245	Got no time or answers for you. Ask a drifter in need of a few caps, they'll give you all the answers you need.
AID00129246	Just minding my business.
AID00129247	Your business, huh? Now there's a store worth tending.
AID00129248	You run along now... judging by that busted pilot light expression you're fixed with, "business" ain't so good.
AID00129249	No, only looking around.
AID00129250	Well, keep those eyes up and turning - or I'll set 'em spinning.
AID00129251	Got no time for gawkers... or anyone looking for something I ain't selling.
AID00129252	I have dog tags to turn in.
AID00129253	In trade for what?
AID00129254	I have dog tags to turn in.
AID00129255	What do you want to trade for?
AID00129256	Food supplies.
AID00129257	How many tags worth?
AID00129258	Ammo.
AID00129259	What type of ammo?
AID00129260	Firearms.
AID00129261	Firearms of what kind?
AID00129262	Armor.
AID00129263	What sort of armor?
AID00129264	Grecks?
AID00129265	Grecks is a bit cracked, but mostly harmless. Just don't mention anything about his lazy eye.
AID00129266	He owes 138 caps and should still be around Freeside.
AID00129267	Lady Jane?
AID00129268	Lady Jane fancies herself a high roller, but she's just another dirtbag NCR prospector. I'm not sure where to find her.
AID00129269	I hear she's run goods for the Followers of the Apocalypse in the past, but other locals might know more. She owes us 250 caps.
AID00129270	Santiago?
AID00129271	Santiago is a suave son of a bitch, but a total pansy when it comes to fisticuffs. He owes 212 caps and should be around Freeside as well.
AID00129272	That's all for now.
AID00129273	Anything else you need?
AID00129274	VDialogueCraigBooneBSRidgeArrive
AID00129275	Canyon 37. That's what the NCR calls the pass down there.
AID00129276	It was the Khans' only escape, so we set up here to guard it while the main force attacked from the front.
AID00129277	Standing orders were to shoot on sight.
AID00129278	VDialogueCraigBooneBSCemetery
AID00129279	Christ. They put the graveyard here.
AID00129280	VDialogueCraigBooneBSArrive
AID00129281	This is the place. We got sent from Camp Golf, looking for some Khans who'd been making trouble with one of our settlements.
AID00129282	I guess one of the settlers was connected, because we sent everything we had. We figured this was a gang hideout, but... they'd led us to their home.
AID00129283	There's a ridge called Coyote Tail on the south side. That's where we set up.
AID00129284	I'm ready to go to Bitter Springs.
AID00129285	All right. Let's head out, then.
AID00129286	Not my problem. You want to go? You're on your own.
AID00129287	You're the one who suggested it.
AID00129288	Fine. If I'm on my own I'm on my own. But I'm gonna go.
AID00129289	Good working with you.
AID00129290	I don't really have time for this now, Boone.
AID00129291	Yeah. Yeah, I guess not. Forget I brought it up.
AID00129292	Okay. We'll make it a point to stop there.
AID00129293	I hope this isn't a mistake.
AID00129294	What changed your mind?
AID00129295	Nothing. Dream. Just tired of thinking about it.
AID00129296	Maybe it would help to go back there.
AID00129297	I don't think so. It won't change anything. And that's a memory I don't want refreshed.
AID00129298	Do you think about Bitter Springs a lot?
AID00129299	Yeah. Always. Even when I sleep.
AID00129300	Why are you still here?
AID00129301	I dunno, I just love it here. What the fuck do you think, asshole?
AID00129302	Prize for second place was I got to live, but they beat my fucking legs with hammers. I'm fucking crippled, get it?
AID00129303	How did you survive?
AID00129304	Luck, that's how! I'm just that fucking lucky!
AID00129305	You're looking at the second place winner of the Nipton lottery! That asshole Swanick took first place, so him they let walk!
AID00129306	What happened to this town?
AID00129307	The Legion happened. What the fuck's it look like?
AID00129308	What sort of lottery did you win?
AID00129309	What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
AID00129310	Only lottery that matters! Oh my God smell that air!
AID00129311	Are you feeling all right?
AID00129312	Are you kidding me? Never felt better!
AID00129313	Captain Gilles at Bitter Springs needs reinforcements. Can you spare any?
AID00129314	What? Why on earth would you think you can walk in here and make troop deployment recommendations to me?
AID00129315	I appreciate your concern for Bitter Springs. You've already been quite helpful to the NCR, I suppose it's only right to return the favor.
AID00129316	Well, you have been a great help here, and with the saboteur dealt with... Yes, I think we can spare a few men. Consider it done.
AID00129317	Who the hell are you, coming in here and asking me if I can "spare any?" I don't hand out NCR troopers to anybody who wanders out of the Wasteland!
AID00129318	Hey, you're a damn fine soldier, and word on the grapevine is that you're already some kind of hero. You got yourself a deal.
AID00129319	After what you did getting my misfits whipped into shape? Yeah, I can spare a couple of boys for Bitter Springs. I'll issue the dispatch orders.
AID00129320	Sorry, I'm not in the habit of letting random civilians dictate my troop deployment schedule.
AID00129321	I'll be honest, the Legion has me worried here, but I think I can spare some soldiers. Consider your request granted.
AID00129322	You handled yourself well against the Legion, and that took some of the pressure off of us. I'll send a couple of troops out there right now.
AID00129323	<That sucks, sorry. No Thanks.>
AID00129324	<I will save them.>
AID00129325	I don't need to hear the details.
AID00129326	Tell me about the lottery.
AID00129327	It ain't like we came to Nipton to play it! Me and my crew had it worked out to kidnap some NCR troopers who come to town to get laid.
AID00129328	Had it all worked out with the scumbag mayor. We were gonna ransom them off, keep their weapons for ourselves, a nice score.
AID00129329	What are we waiting for?
AID00129330	Tell the truth... I think this is exactly what I've been waiting for.
AID00129331	You don't sound surprised.
AID00129332	I'm not. Always figured this was how it was gonna end for me. Just didn't know when.
AID00129333	That day you showed up in Novac, I had a feeling I was supposed to go with you. That it was time to end all this.
AID00129334	And now I know.
AID00129335	Good. Saves us the trouble of finding them.
AID00129336	Ha! If only it was this easy all the time.
AID00129337	Why would they come to Bitter Springs?
AID00129338	Easy target for grabbing slaves. Bunch of refugees, just a few soldiers defending it.
AID00129339	I don't think they're here for us. Too bad. Would've made me feel good about myself.
AID00129340	We can stay on Coyote Tail Ridge for the night.
AID00129341	Let's go up there first, huh?

AID00129343	Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
AID00129344	It might be too big.
AID00129345	I'd prefer not to right now.
AID00129346	Fine, but I'd still like to when we get a chance.
AID00129347	We can do that.
AID00129348	All right. We won't stay for long.
AID00129349	Your only mistake was not bringing enough ammo.
AID00129350	No. I only would've needed one bullet to do things right that day.
AID00129351	How could you kill innocent people like that?
AID00129352	With the Khans, any of them can be dangerous. There's a lot you can't see through a scope.
AID00129353	Still. I often wonder the same thing.
AID00129354	That's not what I would've done at all.
AID00129355	Maybe not. Maybe I wouldn't have either at one point. But that's why they train you. Break you down till you're automatic.
AID00129356	You did what you were supposed to as a soldier.
AID00129357	Yeah, well. I'm not a soldier anymore. Those rules don't seem like much of an excuse now.
AID00129358	Anyway... I don't know why we're here. Thought maybe it'd help me see things better.
AID00129359	I'd like to stay here for the night. Think some things over.
AID00129360	I'm not interested in your stories.
AID00129361	Yeah, I guess not.
AID00129362	What happened?
AID00129363	Main force got spotted too soon. We heard shooting. Then Khans started coming through Canyon 37 in bunches.
AID00129364	It was all wrong, though. Women, kids, elderly. Wounded started coming through, too.
AID00129365	We radioed to confirm our orders but command didn't get what we were seeing. They told us to shoot till we were out of ammo. So that's what we did.
AID00129366	Your friends are safe.
AID00129367	They must have run straight back to camp. I bet they didn't even stop and say thanks.
AID00129368	The NCR could use someone like you. Stop by our camps if you're looking for work.
AID00129369	Goodbye.
AID00129370	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129371	How do you train the creatures?
AID00129372	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129373	What's fighting in the next match?
AID00129374	What are the rules?
AID00129375	The rules are simple. My creatures fight for our pleasure. You can bet on a contender and earn double if you chose the victor.
AID00129376	But you can get a bigger share if you risk your skin in The Thorn. Win a fight and I'll give you a meaty cut of the earnings.
AID00129377	I won't tolerate anyone that interferes with the fights. Offend me, and your blood will be the next to spill. Other than that, anything goes.
AID00129378	Goodbye.
AID00129379	Tell me about you.
AID00129380	I've got questions about Westside.
AID00129381	Let's talk about The Thorn.
AID00129382	Tell me more about The Thorn.
AID00129383	What's this place?
AID00129384	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129385	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129386	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129387	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129388	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129389	Confident, I like that.
AID00129390	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129391	One is good, for now.
AID00129392	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129393	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129394	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129395	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129396	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129397	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129398	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129399	Confident, I like that.
AID00129400	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129401	One is good, for now.
AID00129402	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129403	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129404	I've brought the Fire Gecko Eggs.
AID00129405	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
AID00129406	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
AID00129407	Never mind, let's talk about something else.
AID00129408	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129409	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129410	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129411	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129412	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129413	Confident, I like that.
AID00129414	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129415	One is good, for now.
AID00129416	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129417	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129418	Goodbye.
AID00129419	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129420	I'm listening.
AID00129421	I want to fight in The Pit.
AID00129422	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129423	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129424	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129425	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129426	Never mind, let's talk about something else.
AID00129427	I'll fight Deathclaws.
AID00129428	Now you're talking! I'll be impressed if you make it out alive, stranger.
AID00129429	Having seen what you're capable of, I think you'd fight a horde of them and not bat an eye.
AID00129430	But The Thorn honors balance, not foolish sacrifice. I'll only allow one Deathclaw against you.
AID00129431	I'll fight Geckos.
AID00129432	Be warned, my Geckos are the toughest you'll ever face.
AID00129433	On how many can you take, stranger?
AID00129434	I'll fight Cazadores.
AID00129435	My deadly Cazadores will test your limits.
AID00129436	On how many can you take, stranger?
AID00129437	I'll fight Radscorpions.
AID00129438	Let's see what you've got.
AID00129439	On how many can you take, stranger?
AID00129440	I'll fight Giant Mantises.
AID00129441	Let's test your mettle.
AID00129442	On how many can you take, stranger?
AID00129443	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129444	And I won't stop you, stranger.
AID00129445	What's the name of your deathwish?
AID00129446	How do you train the creatures?
AID00129447	Even if I trusted you I'd not share my secrets just for your pretty face, stranger.
AID00129448	The Thorn's a sacred ground, a source of awe. Here we truly rule over the forces of nature, for once.
AID00129449	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
AID00129450	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
AID00129451	What's fighting in the next match?
AID00129452	We've got a pair of Giant Mantises ready to bleed.
AID00129453	Radscorpions. The crowd loves those.
AID00129454	We're lucky to have some Cazadores in the next match.
AID00129455	Giant Radscorpions are about to battle in The Thorn.
AID00129456	Deadly NightStalkers will now fight for our pleasure.
AID00129457	The strongest Geckos you'll ever see are ready to fight.
AID00129458	The deadliest beast of all! You've never seen anything like this before.
AID00129459	Deathclaws will bleed this sacred ground red! Make your bets, stranger, before it's too late.
AID00129460	Fiend prisoners will fight for their lives against Night Stalkers.
AID00129461	Radscorpions against Fiends.
AID00129462	We've got three fiends ready for our Cazadores.
AID00129463	A rare fight, Deathclaw against Fire Geckos.
AID00129464	Giant Radscorpions against two Deathclaws.
AID00129465	I've brought the Radscorpion Eggs.
AID00129466	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
AID00129467	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
AID00129468	<Questions about Red Lucy>
AID00129469	What's on your mind?
AID00129470	<Questions about Westside>
AID00129471	Ask and you might get an answer.
AID00129472	<Questions about The Thorn>
AID00129473	What do you want to know?
AID00129474	I've brought the Deathclaw's Eggs.
AID00129475	You've, indeed, become the greatest hunter The Thorn has ever seen, the best I've ever seen.
AID00129476	You've earned the honor of being part of this sacred ground. Come to me often and I'll share with you the wealth of The Thorn.
AID00129477	I've brought the Night Stalker Eggs.
AID00129478	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
AID00129479	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
AID00129480	I've brought the Giant Mantis Eggs.
AID00129481	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
AID00129482	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
AID00129483	Goodbye.
AID00129484	So long, stranger.
AID00129485	I'd like to ask about you.
AID00129486	I've got questions about Westside.
AID00129487	What's this place?
AID00129488	The clamor of our bloodthirsty crowds reaches every corner of The Wasteland, but I'll pretend that your ignorance doesn't offend me, stranger.
AID00129489	This is The Thorn! Here's where the strong make a name for themselves and the weak are fed to the jaws of hell.
AID00129490	You can bet on the contenders or, if you have what it takes, be one of the contenders.
AID00129491	Be warned, The Thorn demands respect. Break the rules, or offend me in any way, and I'll gut you open for all to see.
AID00129492	Goodbye.
AID00129493	Tell me about you.
AID00129494	I've got questions about Westside.
AID00129495	Let's talk about The Thorn.
AID00129496	Who are you?
AID00129497	I am Cursor Lucullus, and my orders are to escort you to the Legion's camp at Fortification Hill. Are you ready to go?
AID00129498	10 mm Submachine Gun [30 tags].
AID00129499	Take it.
AID00129500	<Give NCR bug> NCR wants intel on Cottonwood Cove.
AID00129501	Reinforced Leather Armor [20 tags].
AID00129502	This is your size.
AID00129503	Leather Armor [15 tags].
AID00129504	This is your size.
AID00129505	Laser Rifle [50 tags].
AID00129506	Take it.
AID00129507	Laser Pistol [25 tags].
AID00129508	Take it.
AID00129509	9 mm Submachine Gun [20 tags].
AID00129510	Take it.
AID00129511	Grenades [3 tags]
AID00129512	Watch yourself with this.
AID00129513	Dynamite [3 tags].
AID00129514	Watch yourself with this.
AID00129515	Explosives.
AID00129516	Dynamite or grenades?
AID00129517	Small Energy Cells.
AID00129518	Here.
AID00129519	.357 Magnum.
AID00129520	Here.
AID00129521	.22 LR.
AID00129522	Here.
AID00129523	10 mm.
AID00129524	Here.
AID00129525	9 mm.
AID00129526	Here.
AID00129527	20 gauge shotgun shells.
AID00129528	Here.
AID00129529	Let's get out of here. Let them have Bitter Springs.
AID00129530	You can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
AID00129531	I'll take care of it.
AID00129532	Good luck. I'm going to find a place to not get shot.
AID00129533	I can handle them, no problem.
AID00129534	Ok, be careful out there.
AID00129535	What can I do to help?
AID00129536	Hmm.
AID00129537	I think that you should be able to divert the flow of the water into the generator turbines. That would grind them up like hamburger.
AID00129538	The computer to activate it is just ahead, but you may need to go outside to activate the manual override. That system hasn't been used in a while.
AID00129539	<Mike Lawson Warning Greeting>
AID00129540	Good gracious! The Legion is using the intake tunnels to storm their way into the dam, someone has to stop them.
AID00129541	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129542	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00129543	Goodbye.
AID00129544	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129545	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129546	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129547	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129548	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129549	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129550	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129551	< Barter - 50 >
AID00129552	[SUCCEEDED] Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
AID00129553	I'll turn myself in. Thank you for understanding.
AID00129554	Westside's secret is easily worth more, but I'm willing to settle for twenty percent.
AID00129555	[SUCCEEDED] Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
AID00129556	Thank you for keeping my secret. I'll make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.
AID00129557	I'm keeping a very big secret. Twenty percent is fair.
AID00129558	[FAILED] You ask too much. We barely make a profit as it is.
AID00129559	How about twenty percent? Twenty is better.
AID00129560	I'm taking you out, Anderson.
AID00129561	Forget I said anything. I'll keep your secret, but I'm turning you in.
AID00129562	Ten percent it is.
AID00129563	Good. Tell Etienne about our deal and I'll turn myself in.
AID00129564	Then we have an agreement. Thank you for keeping my secret - such a thing will never happen again.
AID00129565	Say I keep Westside's secret - what's in it for me?
AID00129566	Ten percent of the co-op's profits.
AID00129567	No, I'm not going to lie for you.
AID00129568	Then you leave me no choice.
AID00129569	You have a deal.
AID00129570	Thank you. I won't make any trouble when they come for me.
AID00129571	You need to answer for your crime.
AID00129572	I'll surrender on one condition - you protect Westside's secret. Without that water, this community won't survive long.
AID00129573	I'll say that White and I had a... falling out over a woman. A crime of passion, if you will.
AID00129574	Hector told me everything.
AID00129575	I suppose there's no point in denying it any longer. I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
AID00129576	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
AID00129577	What do you do here?
AID00129578	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, and I help the locals in Westside grow crops. Unlike the NCR, the Followers don't expect anything back.
AID00129579	The soil and the hot, dry environment don't make it easy, but we get by all right.
AID00129580	We've even got our own food store, the Westside Co-op, complete with basic refrigeration.
AID00129581	I have some questions about Westside.
AID00129582	I heard Corporal White came here to investigate a water shortage.
AID00129583	No one by that name has come here, I'm afraid. You must've heard wrong. You can ask around if you'd like - they'll all tell you the same thing.
AID00129584	Goodbye.
AID00129585	Take care.
AID00129586	Goodbye.
AID00129587	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129588	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129589	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129590	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129591	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129592	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129593	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129594	Do you have a problem with the NCR?
AID00129595	I don't go looking for fights with them, but they don't have the best interests of people in mind. Certainly not locals.
AID00129596	The bottom line for NCR is productivity and growth. Politicians back in Shady Sands are completely detached from the people actually living here.
AID00129597	Tell me about the co-op.
AID00129598	The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share in the profits of the co-op.
AID00129599	By "captures," do you mean "slaves"?
AID00129600	No, no, no - they haven't yet earned the right to be called "slaves"! Those three in the pen are captures, nothing more.
AID00129601	I'm a Slavemaster, so I know what I'm talking about. Back at the Fort, I'd have those three half-broken and well on their way.
AID00129602	But this is just a holding area, so all I do is assess their fitness and decide whether to send them on.
AID00129603	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
AID00129604	Then stop wasting my time and get on it!
AID00129605	I've spoken to the Great Khans. Their new leader has agreed to fight for the NCR.
AID00129606	Excellent. You've done very well indeed. These tribals will make useful machete fodder.
AID00129607	And if it should turn out we need their land later, well, it's not like we don't have the force to drive them out again.
AID00129608	In the meantime, however, I have something else I want you to look into.
AID00129609	We've had some disturbing reports recently concerning the Omertas, one of the Three Families that run the Strip.
AID00129610	Our intelligence has discovered that high ranking members of the Omertas have been having clandestine meetings for the past several months.
AID00129611	We haven't been able to determine whom they've been meeting with, but if it's Caesar's men, we'll need to act.
AID00129612	I need you to uncover what they're up to, and stop it if it threatens the NCR. Any questions?
AID00129613	I'd like to talk about something else now.
AID00129614	Do you know how he got away from the NCR?
AID00129615	Turned out some of them "Night Kids"  - whatever you call those sneaky Super Mutant types - got in and busted him out.
AID00129616	I guess somebody named "Tabitha" led the bunch that freed him. Don't know much more than that.
AID00129617	People around here aren't afraid of him?
AID00129618	Some folks steer clear of him, for sure, but he don't seem to mind.
AID00129619	How did he end up here on the Westside?
AID00129620	He just showed up here one day. Couldn't really talk, but he remembered me all right.
AID00129621	Ever since then he's just been, well... hanging around, I guess. Does odd jobs for folks and smashes the bad guys when they come poking around.
AID00129622	Enough about the Westside.
AID00129623	What else did you want to chat about?
AID00129624	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00129625	Sure.
AID00129626	What do you do around here?
AID00129627	I run the liquor store in Westside. With things this rough, some folks need a lot of booze just to step out the door in the morning.
AID00129628	After I close up shop, I walk around and help keep the peace. Not that I'm good with a gun, mind you, but someone's got to do it, you know?
AID00129629	Do you know anything about that Super mutant walking around town?
AID00129630	Oh, heh. Yeah, that's Mean Sonofabitch. I know the name sounds bad, but he likes it. He's one nasty old coot.
AID00129631	Far as I can tell, he's one of them original Super Mutants, what came from the Boneyard. Wandered about after that "Master" fellow died.
AID00129632	Eventually got caught somewhere around the Hub, back in NCR. Boy, they sure treated him mean down there. Cut him up so bad he can't talk no more.
AID00129633	I tried to buy him, just so they'd stop hurting him, but they didn't want any of it.
AID00129634	What's so great about the co-op?
AID00129635	Food from the people and for the people. Anyone can buy, but the profits are shared by the folks who make the produce.
AID00129636	Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Ettienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
AID00129637	Anyway, we don't gotta rely on merchants so much. And it means the troopers can use all the food they make over on the east side. Works out nice.
AID00129638	Tell me about the Scorpions.
AID00129639	Not much to tell. Typical gang of dumb bullies and angry nobodies. They're holed up a bit south of here, in the Monte Carlo Suites.
AID00129640	They think they're tough, but any time they tangle with the Fiends, they get torn right up.
AID00129641	Do you have a lot of run-ins with the Fiends?
AID00129642	Not so much lately. The NCR is giving them hell any time they poke their damned heads out. Bless those boys and gals for getting rid of that vermin.
AID00129643	I feel pity for any man or woman that gets addicted to chems, but when they prey on decent folk... well, then it's time to put 'em down.
AID00129644	Can you tell me about Westside?
AID00129645	Well, things aren't great here, but I've seen a lot worse. We've got the Fiends to the south of us, and that ain't good.
AID00129646	The Scorpions hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends.
AID00129647	Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Ettienne. Gets some help from of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
AID00129648	I have some questions about this area.
AID00129649	I might have some answers for you. What did you want to know?
AID00129650	I don't have a hundred caps on me.
AID00129651	Too bad, baby. You know where to find me.
AID00129652	Haha. You're dumber than me.
AID00129653	Fuck you. So what do you want now?
AID00129654	< Blink. >
AID00129655	Ugh. I figured you were a bit slow, but I never thought - forget it, it's done.
AID00129656	Uh... sorry. I don't count so good.
AID00129657	Forget it, it's done.
AID00129658	So, what else did you want?
AID00129659	I'm a little short on caps.
AID00129660	Too bad, baby. Come back when you have the caps. I'll still be here.
AID00129661	A hundred caps? I think you're the one getting the deal here.
AID00129662	Yeah, you are different from my usual guys. Fine, fifty caps, but don't tell anyone.
AID00129663	Fifty caps it is. Let's party.
AID00129664	We can go right over here, baby.
AID00129665	We girls have to stick together. Any chance you could give me a better deal?
AID00129666	Yeah, you're right. For you, and just you, fifty caps. Don't tell anyone.
AID00129667	< Speech 35 >
AID00129668	[SUCCEEDED] Well... no I guess not. Okay - you show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
AID00129669	I wouldn't offer if it wasn't safe.  Do I look like someone who would hurt you?
AID00129670	[FAILED] Um... it's sweet of you to offer, but no thanks.
AID00129671	Mess you up? Nah, it's probably fine. Trust me.
AID00129672	< Medicine 35 >
AID00129673	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you know what you're doing... okay. You show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
AID00129674	I know the right dose for a little thing like you. Medical training, you know.
AID00129675	[FAILED] That's nice, honey, but no thanks.
AID00129676	I used, like, a whole bunch of this stuff and I'm still fine.
AID00129677	How about we just split this Med-X and... relax for a while?
AID00129678	Hmm... I don't know. Doesn't that... mess you up?
AID00129679	Uhh... twenty, twenty five... yeah, I have enough. Here you go.
AID00129680	We can go right over here, baby.
AID00129681	Never mind.
AID00129682	Suit yourself. The offer's always open if you feel like changing your mind.
AID00129683	Where are you from?
AID00129684	Well now, that's unusual. Normally no one cares enough to ask. To be honest, I don't rightly know. My mama was from around these parts.
AID00129685	I can remember her face, but not her name. More than I can remember of my daddy, I guess. We lived in Westside before the Omertas bought me.
AID00129686	As bad as it can be some days in here, it's better than living in that dump.
AID00129687	Let's party. Here's the hundred caps.
AID00129688	We can go right over here, baby.
AID00129689	How much for a good time?
AID00129690	Fuck off. You already screwed me once, and it's not happening again.
AID00129691	A hundred caps. No kissing, no rough stuff.
AID00129692	Fifty caps, just like we agreed.
AID00129693	Goodbye.
AID00129694	Don't be a stranger.
AID00129695	I'm asking the questions here. Tell me what you know.
AID00129696	Did he ever tell you anything about what he was up to?
AID00129697	He's gone missing, and I'm trying to track him down. Any ideas?
AID00129698	He used to go on and on about water and the farms east of the Strip. He was talking to one of the farmers named Bascom, had some problem with NCR.
AID00129699	Boring as hell, but it was his money and his time, so I let him talk about whatever.
AID00129700	You ever spend time with a trooper named White?
AID00129701	Yeah, he used to come around here a lot. Haven't seen him in a while, though. Why?
AID00129702	<SPEECH - player tells CR the daughter has an incurable STD>
AID00129703	[SUCCEEDED] Pustulah -- what? Is that contagious? That doesn't sound good at all!
AID00129704	<Lie> Any fool can see that girl has all the symptoms of Pustular Hypomyalgia!
AID00129705	[FAILED]I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
AID00129706	But the girl is sick. With classic symptoms of, uh... Vagina Dentata?
AID00129707	I can pay you 300 caps.
AID00129708	A fair price. Always best to have caps on hand in case traders stop by.
AID00129709	Here's the key to their collars. You want to take those off before you've gone far, trust me.
AID00129710	I'll give you 150 caps for the lot.
AID00129711	Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
AID00129712	Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
AID00129713	I'll come back if I want to buy them.
AID00129714	Please do. An outbreak of pustulah-whatever is the last thing we need.
AID00129715	Frank sent me to free you.
AID00129716	That man knows where we are? Just when I didn't think this could get any worse!
AID00129717	At least he's too much of a coward to come after us himself. What if he'd ended up in this pen with us?
AID00129718	I've paid for the three of you. You are free to go.
AID00129719	Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
AID00129720	<SPEECH - Player tells her to make a run for it>
AID00129721	[SUCCEEDED] You think we can make it? You really do?
AID00129722	FREEDOM!
AID00129723	Cry freedom! Run for it!
AID00129724	[SUCCEEDED] You think we can make it? You really do?
AID00129725	Run for it!
AID00129726	[FAILED] Are you crazy? They'd run us down in an instant!
AID00129727	If you want to help us, you'll have to come up with something better than suicide!
AID00129728	If you believe hard enough, you can do anything! Run!
AID00129729	I won't turn you in, but what happens when someone else comes looking for White?
AID00129730	What bargain will you accept?
AID00129731	Then I'll turn you in, and the water gets shut off.
AID00129732	If I don't turn you in, will you stop stealing NCR water?
AID00129733	That's not a bargain I can accept. Westside depends on that water for survival and self-reliance.
AID00129734	Then I'm going to kill you.
AID00129735	It'll be simpler to just kill you.
AID00129736	Keep your money. I'll just say that White was killed by the Scorpions.
AID00129737	I could say that... if the price was right.
AID00129738	Perhaps a partnership in the co-op would be enough. Say, ten percent of daily profits?
AID00129739	Consider it done. You stay free and Westside keeps getting water.
AID00129740	Thank you. What happened was regrettable, but I'll make sure it never happens again.
AID00129741	I'd rather not turn you in, but someone else might come looking for White.
AID00129742	If the NCR thinks White was killed by, say, members from the Scorpions gang, it may be enough for them to close the case.
AID00129743	They're still in the mine.
AID00129744	Can you hurry? I know those Legion bastards are tough but my friends won't last long with all the radiation in there.
AID00129745	< Tear Sergeant Teddy in half. >
AID00129746	Sergeant Teddy!
AID00129747	Not so fast. What will you give me for him?
AID00129748	But... I don't have anything. I thought you were my friend!
AID00129749	Here you go.
AID00129750	Thank you!
AID00129751	I got Sergeant Teddy - he's a little chewed up.
AID00129752	That's okay, I'll fix him! Can I have him now?
AID00129753	What did you need help with?
AID00129754	Goodbye.
AID00129755	Bye.
AID00129756	I'll see what I can do.
AID00129757	Thanks!
AID00129758	I can't help you with that right now.
AID00129759	Oh, okay.
AID00129760	They let you have toys here?
AID00129761	I kept him secret, but I think somebody told on me.
AID00129762	Uhh... wouldn't Sergeant Teddy be dead?
AID00129763	He's a toy. I'm not a baby, you know.
AID00129764	What did you need help with?
AID00129765	Antony took Sergeant Teddy away and gave him to the stinky dogs. I want him back!
AID00129766	Here's 120 caps.
AID00129767	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129768	Here's a 100 caps.
AID00129769	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129770	Here's 90 caps.
AID00129771	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129772	Here's 70 caps.
AID00129773	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129774	Here's 80 caps.
AID00129775	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129776	Here's 60 caps.
AID00129777	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129778	Here's 50 caps.
AID00129779	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129780	Here's 40 caps.
AID00129781	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129782	Goodbye.
AID00129783	Let's go back to my earlier questions.
AID00129784	I want to chose the contenders again.
AID00129785	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129786	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00129787	Here's 30 caps.
AID00129788	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129789	Fiend on Blue.
AID00129790	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
AID00129791	Giant Rat on Blue.

AID00129797	Two Giant Mantises on Blue.
AID00129798	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
AID00129799	Three Giant Rats on Blue.
AID00129800	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
AID00129801	Two Giant Rats on Blue.
AID00129802	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.

AID00129805	Giant Mantis on Blue.
AID00129806	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
AID00129807	Three.
AID00129808	What'll fight on Blue?
AID00129809	Two.
AID00129810	What'll fight on Blue?
AID00129811	One.
AID00129812	What'll fight on Blue?
AID00129813	Deathclaw on Red.
AID00129814	How many?
AID00129815	Fire Gecko on Red.
AID00129816	How many?
AID00129817	Radscorpion on Red.
AID00129818	How many?
AID00129819	Giant Radscorpion on Red.
AID00129820	How many?
AID00129821	Giant Mantis on Red.
AID00129822	How many?
AID00129823	Nightstalker on Red.
AID00129824	How many?
AID00129825	Cazador on Red.
AID00129826	how many?
AID00129827	Goodbye.
AID00129828	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129829	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129830	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129831	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129832	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129833	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129834	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129835	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129836	What's fighting in the next match?
AID00129837	Goodbye.
AID00129838	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00129839	I want to set up a mixed fight.
AID00129840	Do you set up custom fights?
AID00129841	My creatures are expensive to find, expensive to raise, and expensive to maintain.
AID00129842	If your pleasure is to see them bleed at your will, I'll oblige only after my costs are covered, stranger.
AID00129843	Those costs will change depending on your choice of fighters. Also, I'll only allow fair fights in The Thorn.
AID00129844	I'll help you set up good matches. You pay, you bet, and I bring you the most delightful spectacle on this world. Are we clear?
AID00129845	Do you set up custom fights?
AID00129846	I want to set up a mixed fight.
AID00129847	You are paying for it. What'll bleed today in The Thorn, stranger?
AID00129848	I want to set up a mixed fight.
AID00129849	Goodbye.
AID00129850	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129851	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129852	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129853	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129854	Confident, I like that.
AID00129855	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129856	One is good, for now.
AID00129857	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129858	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129859	I'll fight Night Stalkers.
AID00129860	Prepare yourself, these Night Stalkers are hungry for blood.
AID00129861	On how many can you take, stranger?
AID00129862	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129863	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129864	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129865	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129866	Confident, I like that.
AID00129867	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129868	One is good, for now.
AID00129869	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129870	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129871	I'm ready for greater challenges.
AID00129872	You've proven yourself, stranger. Your blood hungers for glory and I'll placate its thirst.
AID00129873	Name your challenge.
AID00129874	Three of them, bring it on!
AID00129875	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00129876	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129877	Two are no problem for me.
AID00129878	Confident, I like that.
AID00129879	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129880	One is good, for now.
AID00129881	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00129882	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00129883	I'll fight Giant Radscorpions.
AID00129884	Giant Radscorpions make deadly opponents.
AID00129885	On how many can you take?
AID00129886	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129887	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AID00129888	Goodbye.
AID00129889	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129890	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129891	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129892	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129893	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129894	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129895	Goodbye.
AID00129896	I've got other questions for you.
AID00129897	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129898	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
AID00129899	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129900	I'll bet 20 on Red.
AID00129901	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
AID00129902	Never mind.
AID00129903	Was there something else?
AID00129904	About the effectiveness of your healing powders...
AID00129905	What about it? Do you have some advice?
AID00129906	< Survival 20 >
AID00129907	[SUCCEEDED] Oh - I've been using two roots per flower. Thanks to you, I'll be able to create twice as much healing powder per day.
AID00129908	You are using one broc flower per xander root, right?
AID00129909	[FAILED] I'd rather not go experimenting. Some of these wasteland plants are toxic.
AID00129910	Maybe you could try using different plants and herbs?
AID00129911	I'd like some healing powder.
AID00129912	I can only do that if you're a friend of the Legion. I don't want to get crucified.
AID00129913	Here. Come back in a day if you need more.
AID00129914	I can't give you any more right now. Come back in a day.
AID00129915	Do you have anything for sale?
AID00129916	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some healing powder every day, but you'd have to be a friend of the Legion.
AID00129917	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some supplies every day, though - you are, after all, a friend of the Legion.
AID00129918	You're a doctor?
AID00129919	I never finished my training - the Legion saw to that when they overran my town.
AID00129920	I do know basic first aid, but I've had to rely on tribal remedies to treat illnesses and injuries - healing powders and all that.
AID00129921	I'm always running low on xander root. Plenty of broc flowers, though.
AID00129922	You call that a challenge? Ha.
AID00129923	You thought wrong.
AID00129924	Take the bear. I can't believe I let some of my best dogs get killed over this stupid thing.
AID00129925	Your stuff is in the crate next to the arena entrance. Leave it there too long and we'll dump it in the lake.
AID00129926	Huh. I could've sworn I had that stupid bear on me. Well, tough luck for you, I guess.
AID00129927	Let's do this.
AID00129928	Good luck - you'll need it.
AID00129929	I need to think about this.
AID00129930	You do that.
AID00129931	The mongrels won't touch me. Animals like me.
AID00129932	I thought something was wrong. We usually have to pull them off any visitors to the Fort.
AID00129933	Well, that's no fun. Take the bear. I'll find them something else to chew on.
AID00129934	You won't mind if I kill them?
AID00129935	I think they'll probably end up killing you. I trained them myself. But, if you do win somehow, the mongrels will at least get honorable deaths.
AID00129936	I'm here for Melody's bear.
AID00129937	The stupid girl should know by now that even the rags on her back are a privilege. Anyway, my mongrels like their new toy.
AID00129938	Tell you what - you square off with four of my best dogs. No armor and no weapons except a machete. You survive and I let you have the bear.
AID00129939	You ready to fight my mongrels, then?
AID00129940	I don't have enough caps right now.
AID00129941	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00129942	I don't have enough caps right now.

AID00130076	Nice dog.
AID00130077	Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl?
AID00130078	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
AID00130079	This is no time for questions! Get back topside and protect the president!
AID00130080	I don't know. The visit is still going on up there.
AID00130081	Then what the hell are you doing down here? Get back topside and protect the president!
AID00130082	The president was killed by assassins.
AID00130083	Damn it! The timing couldn't be any worse. I tried to warn those buffoons, but they insisted on this little show.
AID00130084	We'll be lucky if the men don't throw down their guns and surrender as the Legion approaches. I guess there's nothing to be done about it now.
AID00130085	The president has departed safely.
AID00130086	Good, his death could have had a major impact on morale. This whole affair was ill-advised from the start, and I for one am glad it's over.
AID00130087	While you were out, General Oliver arrived and briefed all senior officers regarding a change in our strategy.
AID00130088	I'm not at liberty to divulge what was said, but I've been instructed to send you to him immediately.
AID00130089	He's set up his camp in the office area at the south end of this power plant.
AID00130090	Dismissed.
AID00130091	I talked the Brotherhood into supporting the NCR.
AID00130092	And you believed them? Do you have any idea how long we've been fighting those bastards?
AID00130093	Ugh, Crocker will have a field day with this. He'll want to establish diplomatic relations with them, for pete's sake.
AID00130094	But we've got more important matters to attend to. The president is due to arrive soon, and we're sure the Legion won't waste such an opportunity.
AID00130095	I want you to assist the security detail we've prepared for the president. His safety is critical to maintaining the mens' fighting spirit.
AID00130096	Go up to the visitor center and speak to Ranger Grant. He's in charge of security during the president's visit. Dismissed.
AID00130097	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
AID00130098	Not yet.
AID00130099	Don't give up. They're out there, somewhere, and we're not safe until they've been destroyed.
AID00130100	The Brotherhood has been eliminated.
AID00130101	Ah, that's a relief. A Brotherhood attack while we're busy with the Legion would be catastrophic.
AID00130102	The situation being what it is, we can't afford to lose even a single man unnecessarily.
AID00130103	No ma'am.
AID00130104	Dismissed.
AID00130105	I thought the Brotherhood were all wiped out at HELIOS One. How could they have survived?
AID00130106	After the battle, we consolidated our hold on the plant before pursuing our enemies.
AID00130107	It was a mistake, to be sure, but there wasn't really any place for them to go. When we finally gave chase, however, they had simply vanished.
AID00130108	Some of our people think they had some means of conveyance, like the vertibirds the Enclave used, and hightailed it out of here.
AID00130109	I think that they found someplace to hide close to HELIOS, and never went that far at all. Any other questions?
AID00130110	How do you expect me to destroy an entire Brotherhood chapter?
AID00130111	A fair question, and one I've had our strategists think about for some time. Their consensus is that we must focus on the one thing we can count on.
AID00130112	With the Brotherhood that's their obsessive attachment to technology. They'd never go anywhere that didn't have working power.
AID00130113	I'm willing to bet that wherever they're hiding, there's a working reactor powering their equipment. That's their vulnerability.
AID00130114	Detonate that reactor, and we can safely cross the Brotherhood off our list of concerns. Was there anything else?
AID00130115	Is there no peaceful way to resolve this?
AID00130116	No, just because you secured the aid of the Khans, assuming they don't try to kill us, don't think the Brotherhood will be so easily swayed.
AID00130117	These are people that both hate us *and* outgun us. There can be no compromise. Anything else?
AID00130118	Don't even think about it. Any Brotherhood survivors likely harbor a deep grudge against us. We can't afford to leave such an enemy alive.
AID00130119	Any other objections? Maybe you'd like to bring the Brotherhood some flowers?
AID00130120	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
AID00130121	I'm still working on it.
AID00130122	I shouldn't have to say this, but please don't bother me until the mission is completed.
AID00130123	I killed Mr. House.
AID00130124	Then that's one more nuisance we won't have to worry about. Good work. Our efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
AID00130125	Mr. House won't be a problem. He's been disconnected from his system.
AID00130126	But he's still alive? I'll have to remember to send someone to follow up on that later. Anyway, at least he's out of the picture for the time being.
AID00130127	You might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
AID00130128	The brass have been throwing around the idea of having the president visit the dam for a while now. To rally the troops and boost morale and such.
AID00130129	With our recent achievements, they finally feel secure enough to stage the damn thing. But while it's being planned, I have one last mission for you.
AID00130130	Several years ago, we managed to wrest the HELIOS One solar power station from the Brotherhood of Steel chapter local to this area.
AID00130131	It was a crushing victory, but no one's heard a peep from the Brotherhood since. Most people assume the Brotherhood is scattered and not a threat.
AID00130132	Recently we've had scouts go missing in an area west of HELIOS, and I'm concerned that the Brotherhood is involved.
AID00130133	I want you to find them, and once you do, finish them for good. Any questions?
AID00130134	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
AID00130135	If you must, but please keep it brief.
AID00130136	
AID00130137	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't dismiss it that lightly, but it's nothing we need get involved with for now. Good work, I suppose.
AID00130138	<Lie> The Omertas are planning to attack New Reno. It's none of NCR's concern.
AID00130139	[FAILED] I highly doubt that. You'd do well to report only facts to me, otherwise we might have ourselves a problem.
AID00130140	However, their activity has quieted down some so maybe my original information was wrong.
AID00130141	<Lie> You've got nothing to worry about. The Omertas are perfectly clean.
AID00130142	I'm still working on it.
AID00130143	The next time we speak, I expect you to have something for me.
AID00130144	The Omertas were up to something big, but I stopped them.
AID00130145	Excellent. You'd think living in the lap of luxury and power would be enough for some people, but no.
AID00130146	But we have other problems. While investigating the Omertas, what little I could on my end, I came across something much more sinister.
AID00130147	Evidence suggests that Mr. House is planning to make some kind of move when the battle breaks out, and I'm guessing he won't be coming to our rescue.
AID00130148	While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to avoid all risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
AID00130149	Now that that's out of the way, let's see... Mr. House was a concern, but someone conveniently dealt with him for us.
AID00130150	Oh, that reminds me, you might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.
AID00130151	Can you give me any leads?
AID00130152	Our preliminary research shows that the Omertas used to do some business in Freeside, mostly buying weapons. Any other questions?
AID00130153	Where should I start?
AID00130154	Head to their casino, Gomorrah, and ask around. If you discover that what they're up to threatens the NCR, stop it.
AID00130155	The Omertas themselves likely won't be forthcoming, so you may need to talk to some of their help to pick up a trail. Anything else?
AID00130156	The Khans won't be a problem to anyone ever again.
AID00130157	Good riddance. We've had reports for years that they're the ones who supply the Fiends with chems, but no one's done anything about it.
AID00130158	In any event, no one will miss them. And I've got another mission for you.
AID00130159	No further questions, ma'am.
AID00130160	No questions, ma'am.
AID00130161	Good. I look forward to hearing of your progress.
AID00130162	Dismissed.
AID00130163	Will I have any NCR support in this?
AID00130164	I can't lend you any troops, but I've already sent word to quartermaster Bardon that you're to be given full access to our hardware.
AID00130165	You'll have to pay for what you take, however. We can't afford to give away equipment. Did you have any other questions?
AID00130166	What if I find they're committed to joining Caesar?
AID00130167	Then you'll need to make sure none of them are left to do so. Any other questions?
AID00130168	I might have heard of them. Remind me.
AID00130169	They're a rowdy bunch, and pride themselves as warriors. The dark leather and horned helmets they wear are pretty distinctive.
AID00130170	I have a score to settle with them.
AID00130171	Good, that anger is something I can use, and I think you may get a chance to settle your score sooner than you might have planned.
AID00130172	You could say we've had dealings.
AID00130173	Then I don't need to tell you that they can be a pain in the ass.
AID00130174	The NCR has a rather sordid history with them, and I'm concerned that we'll find them aiding our enemies when the Legion attack comes.
AID00130175	That is, unless we get to them first. I want you to visit them in their canyons to the far west and make sure they're in no shape to join the Legion.
AID00130176	They're just another gang of raiders as far as I'm concerned, so deal with them appropriately. Any questions?
AID00130177	I'm a little busy at the moment.
AID00130178	But not too busy to come all the way out here? I don't think so. Stay a while, and listen to my offer.
AID00130179	Yes, ma'am.
AID00130180	Since the majority of my men are on assignment dealing with the Legion, I need someone to handle other matters that have arisen.
AID00130181	Make no mistake, there's a battle coming, and I intend to make sure there are no loose ends when the time comes.
AID00130182	One such loose end is a gang known as the Great Khans. Have you heard of them?
AID00130183	Looks tougher than I thought. We'll have to find another solution.
AID00130184	Anything that gets us out of here, please.
AID00130185	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
AID00130186	[SUCCEEDED] My goodness! I swear my heart skipped a beat!
AID00130187	[FAILED] That's enough of that! If you're going to get us out of here, it'll have to be another way.
AID00130188	Let me deactivate your collar.
AID00130189	No way. If the guard catches you, we'll be beaten.
AID00130190	If you want to help, get that gate unlocked or see if you can get the one they call Canyon Runner to let us go.
AID00130191	All you're doing is killing us! Leave us alone!
AID00130192	If there's any chance you can free us, it's worth the risk...
AID00130193	I'm working on it.
AID00130194	Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionaire's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
AID00130195	Never mind. I'll see if there is another way to free you.
AID00130196	Good idea. I'd like to keep my head intact.
AID00130197	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
AID00130198	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, you did it! Nice work!
AID00130199	RF detonator? Give me a second.<Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
AID00130200	[FAILED] Forget it, I'm not gonna get my head blown off just because you don't know what you're doing!
AID00130201	Hold still! <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
AID00130202	Let me deactivate your collar.
AID00130203	No way! I seen what happens when you mess with these collars!
AID00130204	Sounds like I don't have much choice.
AID00130205	Never mind. I'll see if there is another way to free you.
AID00130206	Yeah, like get the key from the slavemaster or pay him to release us?
AID00130207	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
AID00130208	[SUCCEEDED] You did it! Thank you so much!
AID00130209	[FAILED] Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. It is obvious you don't know what you're doing!
AID00130210	I'm working on it.
AID00130211	Hurry up. The guards keep eyeing me like I'm a piece of meat.
AID00130212	Let me deactivate your collar.
AID00130213	So you can kill more of us? Get away from me!
AID00130214	If you say so... you know these collars have a bomb in them, don't you?
AID00130215	They're already dead.
AID00130216	Legion bastards. They'll pay for that.
AID00130217	Were they the NCR hostages in the mine?
AID00130218	Were? What do you mean were?
AID00130219	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130220	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130221	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130222	Relax, this'll be over quickly. <Set off the explosive in his collar>
AID00130223	What have you done?
AID00130224	Are you trying to get me killed? Get away from me!
AID00130225	Don't worry your little head, Sammy. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
AID00130226	[SUCCEEDED] Why? Why?
AID00130227	[FAILED] Okay, you can quit. I don't know what you're trying to do, but it ain't helping.
AID00130228	So what's next for you?
AID00130229	I'm getting ready to run a caravan up towards Utah. There's a town called New Canaan which is supposed to be pretty prosperous.
AID00130230	The Crimson Caravan doesn't have any branches out that way, so it'll be up to me get to things started.
AID00130231	Who's in charge here?
AID00130232	Alice McLafferty runs the Crimson Caravan. You can find her over in the main office.
AID00130233	Goodbye.
AID00130234	Ta-ta.
AID00130235	I've decided to let the Legion crucify you.
AID00130236	You'll get your freedom if you kill me in single combat. Just you, me, and machetes.
AID00130237	I'm ready.
AID00130238	Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
AID00130239	I'm ready.
AID00130240	Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
AID00130241	Never mind.
AID00130242	All right. Did you want something else?
AID00130243	I need some time to prepare.
AID00130244	Very well.
AID00130245	Got it. I'm ready.
AID00130246	Good luck.
AID00130247	I'm ready.
AID00130248	Remember the rules: light armor and machetes only. And, of course, to the death.
AID00130249	I'd like to fight in the arena.
AID00130250	Know your place, woman. Unlike the Profligates of the NCR, only men fight in the Legion.
AID00130251	Only you may enter. Tell your companion to wait and speak to me again.
AID00130252	That can be arranged. You will be facing off against a couple of disobedient slaves - not much of challenge, but it might be entertaining to watch.
AID00130253	There's a captured NCR trooper available - Sergeant Andrews. He's already been challenged once and survived, so he should be a worthy opponent.
AID00130254	I have a dangerous one for you - an NCR Ranger by the name of Stella. We got lucky, since we rarely capture Rangers alive.
AID00130255	Even though she's a woman, she's killed every man who's faced her in the arena, even one of the elite Centurions. With her bare hands.
AID00130256	Sorry, but there's nobody left who'd even be a challenge for you.
AID00130257	What do you do?
AID00130258	I set up the fights, keep track of prisoners available, and make sure the arena's cleaned up.
AID00130259	Who does the fighting?
AID00130260	Most of the time it's some young Legionary trying to make a name for himself, hoping to get noticed by Caesar or the Praetorians.
AID00130261	We pit slaves or prisoners against each other once in awhile, but it's not much of a show. They're usually too reluctant to kill each other.
AID00130262	What are the rules?
AID00130263	Light armor and machetes only. The challenger - the one who asks to enter the arena - may be pitted against one or more opponents.
AID00130264	All matches continue until one side is dead. No exceptions.
AID00130265	That's enough about the arena. Let's talk about something else.
AID00130266	Like what?
AID00130267	Tell me more about the arena.
AID00130268	Such as?
AID00130269	Any idea where I might find those books?
AID00130270	Caravan companies are probably your best bet. Smaller traders aren't likely to have anything that esoteric.
AID00130271	I got them out alive.
AID00130272	I was worried Alexus had already thrown them down a mineshaft. I'll run by camp and see how they're doing when I get a chance. Thanks for the help.
AID00130273	No ma'am.
AID00130274	Liza O'Malley at the Embassy may have some information for you as well.
AID00130275	Dismissed.
AID00130276	VDialogueCraigBooneCLAttackFinish
AID00130277	I think we're clear.
AID00130278	VDialogueCraigBooneWave3
AID00130279	More coming!
AID00130280	VDialogueCraigBooneWave2
AID00130281	We need to get to the camp before they do!
AID00130282	Get over it. It's war. People die. Why should it matter whether they're soldiers or civilians?
AID00130283	With the Khans, the only difference between a soldier and a civilian is that the civilian is more likely to miss when he shoots at you.
AID00130284	Maybe Bitter Springs just seemed different. Maybe it's the same as killing legionaries.
AID00130285	They'd have died whether or not they were soldiers. Whether or not I was there. And my leaving the NCR hasn't stopped any wars or saved any lives.
AID00130286	There's no controlling war. No sense regretting what you can't stop.
AID00130287	You can't take back what you've done. But your regrets can set you on a better path.
AID00130288	I guess they brought us here. One less Legion raiding party running loose now. Never a bad thing, you can take my word for that.
AID00130289	Still feels like I'm living on borrowed time. But I don't see any reason not to take a lot more of those sons of bitches with me.
AID00130290	You got a point. There's still some things I can do before all this is over.
AID00130291	Having to live with what you've done is your punishment.
AID00130292	I never thought of it that way. Always expected something... more final. But maybe it is.
AID00130293	No one is judging or punishing you. Things just happen.
AID00130294	If that's how it is, there's not a lot of comfort in knowing it.
AID00130295	Maybe it's just not your time yet.
AID00130296	<Sighs> Goddamn it. It's like I'm being toyed with.
AID00130297	I don't know what I'm supposed to do about all this.
AID00130298	I wasn't going to let you die.
AID00130299	I don't mean disrespect. It's a hell of a thing having someone with your ability looking out for me.
AID00130300	But I've come to believe that there are things nobody can stop. I thought for sure that's what we'd finally come up against today.
AID00130301	It would've made sense for things to end here. But now... I'm still waiting.
AID00130302	You underestimated us.
AID00130303	Guess I did. Guess I figured whatever we could handle, this time the Legion was going to send more.
AID00130304	I should've died here a long time ago. When I spotted the legionaries today I thought I understood. Things were finally going to even out.
AID00130305	But I'm still here and nothing's changed.
AID00130306	Why aren't you sure?
AID00130307	Thought my time had come. For a minute there everything made sense. I could feel the end coming. I was ready for it.
AID00130308	Now... I'm back where I was.
AID00130309	Are you the one who's been raiding the refugee camp at Bitter Springs?
AID00130310	Refugee camp? Is that what they're calling it? Good old NCR, they can whitewash anything.
AID00130311	Let me tell you something, that refugee camp? It's built on the blood and tears of my people. Nobody likes to talk about it, but I remember.
AID00130312	What happened to your people?
AID00130313	We were the Flails of God. The scourge of the Mojave, the best warriors and raiders in the Wasteland. Until the NCR tracked us back to Bitter Springs.
AID00130314	The main force hit the canyon by surprise. While our warriors tried to hold them off, we sent our women, our children, our old through the Red Pass.
AID00130315	NCR's First Recon Battalion was waiting for them on Coyote Tail Ridge. No Khan left alive, that was the order. My family....
AID00130316	It's time to die.
AID00130317	Come for me then. Flails of God!
AID00130318	Come for me then. Flails of God!
AID00130319	Spare me your sob story, it's time to die.
AID00130320	I'm still looking for the Deathclaw Eggs.
AID00130321	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130322	I'm still looking for the Cazador Eggs.
AID00130323	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130324	I'm still looking for the Night Stalker Eggs.
AID00130325	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130326	I will, Lucy.
AID00130327	Thank you, my brave hunter.
AID00130328	Goodbye.
AID00130329	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130330	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130331	You've done enough to last many lifetimes, stranger. But... I'd like you to come see me, again.
AID00130332	I'll find this great prize for you.
AID00130333	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
AID00130334	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
AID00130335	Where can I find Deathclaw Eggs?
AID00130336	Quarry Junction is overrun with Deathclaws, but you may stand a better chance at a nest near the Repconn Test Site.
AID00130337	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
AID00130338	That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
AID00130339	A 1000 caps will do. Take the eggs.
AID00130340	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AID00130341	Goodbye.
AID00130342	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130343	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130344	Those Cazadores almost killed me. Pay me more or... just pay me more, alright?
AID00130345	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
AID00130346	There's almost nothing worse than Cazadores in The Wasteland. Great deeds deserve great rewards.
AID00130347	You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
AID00130348	I've brought the Cazador Eggs.
AID00130349	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
AID00130350	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
AID00130351	I'll find the Cazador Eggs for you.
AID00130352	The crowd loves your bravery.
AID00130353	So long, stranger.
AID00130354	So long, stranger.
AID00130355	Where can I find Cazador Eggs?
AID00130356	Cazadores are extremely deadly, but they are also reclusive. Try looking near the Red Rock's canyons.
AID00130357	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
AID00130358	That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
AID00130359	700 caps will do. Take the eggs.
AID00130360	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AID00130361	I'm getting tired of running around all over The Wasteland for a handful of caps. I want more.
AID00130362	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
AID00130363	Goodbye.
AID00130364	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130365	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130366	I've braved packs of Night Stalkers to get these eggs. My reward should match this effort.
AID00130367	You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
AID00130368	<Placeholder Node for Successful Quest Returns>
AID00130369	Do you have good news for The Thorn?
AID00130370	I'm still looking for the Fire Gecko eggs.
AID00130371	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130372	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
AID00130373	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
AID00130374	500 caps sound good. Take the eggs.
AID00130375	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AID00130376	I'll find the Night Stalker Eggs for you.
AID00130377	Confident, I like that.
AID00130378	So long, stranger.
AID00130379	So long, stranger.
AID00130380	Where can I find Night Stalker Eggs?
AID00130381	Night Stalkers are amongst the most fearsome beasts you'll ever face. They're also hard to find, but I know of a nest at a cave near Bittersprings.
AID00130382	Goodbye.
AID00130383	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130384	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130385	Those Fire Geckos are not easy... not easy at all. I deserve more caps.
AID00130386	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
AID00130387	I've shown you my worth. Doesn't your best hunter deserve the best rewards?
AID00130388	You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
AID00130389	I'm still looking for the Radscorpion Eggs.
AID00130390	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130391	I'll find the Fire Gecko eggs for you.
AID00130392	Confident, I like that.
AID00130393	So long, stranger.
AID00130394	So long, stranger.
AID00130395	Where can I find Fire Gecko eggs?
AID00130396	Fire Geckos are among The Wasteland's most dangerous creatures. Near the Ireteba Peaks lies a nest where you may find their eggs.
AID00130397	Goodbye.
AID00130398	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130399	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130400	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
AID00130401	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
AID00130402	300 caps are enough. Take the eggs.
AID00130403	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AID00130404	I'm risking my life for you at every turn. Pay up or find another hunter.
AID00130405	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
AID00130406	I was planing on helping you get even deadlier creatures, but not without a raise.
AID00130407	You're proving your worth to The Thorn. I hope these extra caps are sufficient to demonstrate my fairness.
AID00130408	Goodbye.
AID00130409	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00130410	Perhaps, I'll keep the eggs for now.
AID00130411	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130412	I've got other questions for you.
AID00130413	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
AID00130414	Goodbye.
AID00130415	Maybe later, let's go back to my other questions.
AID00130416	I'll find the Radscorpion eggs for you.
AID00130417	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00130418	So long, stranger.
AID00130419	So long, stranger.
AID00130420	Goodbye.
AID00130421	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00130422	Where can I find Radscorpion eggs?
AID00130423	The eggs I seek are not easy to find, stranger. Your best chances are in the mountains north of Goodsprings, and west from Quarry Junction.
AID00130424	Goodbye.
AID00130425	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
AID00130426	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
AID00130427	200 caps are sufficient. Take the eggs.
AID00130428	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AID00130429	Let's talk about the creature's eggs that you need.
AID00130430	<Questions about VMS38 quest>
AID00130431	Bring me a dozen Radscorpion eggs. I'll see to it that you're rewarded fairly.
AID00130432	Bring me a dozen Fire Gecko eggs. This great challenge will earn you a matching reward.
AID00130433	The Thorn's calling its elite hunters to collect one of its deadliest creatures. Find Night Stalker eggs and your bravery will be greatly rewarded.
AID00130434	I'm asking our top hunters to gather Cazador eggs. I'd be impressed by whoever returns with such a prize.
AID00130435	This is it, hunter. I've decided to grant you the opportunity to earn the greatest honor The Thorn could ever expect.
AID00130436	Deathclaws are our most precious and our most feared contenders. I want you to be the one to deliver the sacred eggs to me, personally.
AID00130437	I don't agree with it because... because it was very dangerous and I deserve more caps.
AID00130438	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
AID00130439	Who else can bring you so many intact eggs? I deserve a bigger reward.
AID00130440	You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
AID00130441	I'm still looking for the Giant Mantis Eggs.
AID00130442	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
AID00130443	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00130444	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00130445	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00130446	How do you find these creatures?
AID00130447	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of servicing The Thorn.
AID00130448	Goodbye.
AID00130449	Maybe later. Let's go back to my questions.
AID00130450	I'll find Giant Mantis' eggs for you.
AID00130451	You've got yourself a deal.
AID00130452	So long, stranger.
AID00130453	So long, stranger.
AID00130454	Let's talk about the creature's eggs you need.
AID00130455	Where can I find Giant Mantis' eggs?
AID00130456	You'll find egg-carrying Mantises in The Wasteland. But a wise hunter would search at a Mantis' breeding ground, like the nearby ruins of Vault 22.
AID00130457	How could I help The Thorn?
AID00130458	Think you have what it takes? Hmm, all right. Prove your worth and I'll reward your service.
AID00130459	The Thorn needs newborn specimens that will one day grow to honor us with their blood.
AID00130460	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
AID00130461	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
AID00130462	At least, tell me how you find these creatures.
AID00130463	Our creatures come from the farthest reaches of the Wasteland. The Thorn takes care of them until the time to spill their blood comes.
AID00130464	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of serving The Thorn.
AID00130465	Goodbye.
AID00130466	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00130467	There are a lot of tents here.
AID00130468	And just about every one of them is occupied. Not all at the same time, usually - groups of Legionaries come and go all the time.
AID00130469	This also only one camp of many. You might have noticed the other camps down by the river.
AID00130470	Let's talk about something else.
AID00130471	Sure thing.
AID00130472	What did happen at Bitter Springs?
AID00130473	I still don't know exactly. Just that a lot of people died who didn't want to be part of the fighting at all.
AID00130474	I don't blame anybody for it. There's so much chaos when you're fighting, you're lucky not to shoot your own guys.
AID00130475	But it did take something out of it for me. Just wasn't the same. So when it came time to re-enlist, I just took my papers and walked.
AID00130476	So why'd you leave?
AID00130477	Ah, well... I just felt like it was time, you know? Wanted to have a home.
AID00130478	Plus I was up at Camp Golf when Bitter Springs went down. I faked like I was sick to get out of going, because I knew some of the people there.
AID00130479	But when everybody came back nobody would tell me what happened. And people would call us murderers sometimes when we showed up to secure towns.
AID00130480	What was your tour with the NCR like?
AID00130481	Oh, it was great. I wouldn't trade it.
AID00130482	Something about that lifestyle, the discipline. Seeing new places, making people safe. What's not to like?
AID00130483	I found a detonator on that man over there.
AID00130484	What the hell? This must control some sort of bomb that he was going to use to kill the President.
AID00130485	Nice work catching this. I'll have my Rangers go deal with this man right away.
AID00130486	I found a bomb on the President's vertibird.
AID00130487	A bomb on the President's vertibird? Only a limited number of people had access to the vertibird.
AID00130488	We have to get the President out of here now. I'll cancel the speech and have security search the area.
AID00130489	We can't relax until we get the President out of here safely.
AID00130490	Trust me, your troubles are over. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
AID00130491	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not like this!
AID00130492	[FAILED] I appreciate you trying, but you'll have to find another way to get us out of here.
AID00130493	I took care of that slave caravan.
AID00130494	You know what I'd be real excited about? If you'd showed up and saved me before they smashed my legs.
AID00130495	Now why don't you fuck off and let me sleep, hero? That'd be real exciting, too.
AID00130496	<Goodbye Placeholder.>
AID00130497	Goodbye.
AID00130498	Goodbye.
AID00130499	I've dealt with the attacks on the camp. They won't be a problem any more.
AID00130500	You did? Who was it? Any information you can give me would be a big help for my reports.
AID00130501	I appreciate the information, but I really wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have the manpower. If you could deal with him, I'd be in your debt.
AID00130502	I found your attacker. There's a Great Khan hiding out in the mountains. I can lead your men there.
AID00130503	I understand. I'll leave you to your grief, then.
AID00130504	As you wish.
AID00130505	If you insist. Let's finish this.
AID00130506	Let's not be hasty. I'll be back.
AID00130507	Why should I let you leave? You could lead the NCR right to me. I should kill you now.
AID00130508	I promised Captain Gilles I'd stop the attacks on Bitter Springs.
AID00130509	Then you'll have to kill me. My vengeance will not be stayed.
AID00130510	Take revenge on the people actually responsible: Go attack Camp McCarran.
AID00130511	You're right. A Khan's vengeance should be direct and bloody. No more skulking in caves - I'll remind the NCR why they feared us!
AID00130512	The Khans settled in Red Rock Canyon years ago. It's time to let go of your hate and join them.
AID00130513	Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe three years is vengeance enough. Thank you for helping me see that.
AID00130514	Here. This will unlock the supply caches we left in caves around these mountains. You might get some use out of them.
AID00130515	The people at this camp aren't responsible for your family's death. They're refugees.
AID00130516	[SUCCEEDED] I know that. But what else can I do?
AID00130517	[FAILED] Keep deluding yourself if you want. I've seen the NCR's true face.
AID00130518	But the NCR are trying to help! They're good people, fighting for civilization in a lawless waste!
AID00130519	So you've been hiding in these mountains ever since? Why?
AID00130520	For revenge! The NCR committed an atrocity here, an atrocity that they tried to bury and forget. I'm going to remind them.
AID00130521	How do I reach Fortification Hill?
AID00130522	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you at the docks. He'll take you to Caesar.
AID00130523	I'm ready now. Let's go.
AID00130524	< Barter 50 >
AID00130525	[SUCCEEDED] All right, two it is. They'll still be more than enough to take you down, I think.
AID00130526	Potentially losing four dogs is a very high price to pay for a toy. What about two?
AID00130527	[FAILED] No deal. You and four of my dogs. Not two, not three - four.
AID00130528	Can't we make some kind of deal?
AID00130529	The Dam?
AID00130530	The big one. The one the NCR is trying to hold onto, that the Legion's pushing for. Whole war depends on holding it.
AID00130531	Do you know Colonel Hsu at all?
AID00130532	Yeah. He introduced himself to me once. I shook his hand. Doubt he'd remember me now, though.
AID00130533	When he looked at you, you could see he understood. After some of the things we'd seen, that meant something.
AID00130534	What I heard, he'd be a general right now if Oliver didn't know the president.
AID00130535	What do you think of General Oliver?
AID00130536	Didn't know him. He's a signature on my discharge papers.
AID00130537	Wasn't real popular, though. Even overheard my C.O. complain about him once.
AID00130538	"General Wait-and-see," he called him.
AID00130539	What was Camp Golf like?
AID00130540	It was on the front line for a while. Only resort in New Vegas no one wanted to get sent to.
AID00130541	Doesn't have that kind of importance anymore, though. They pulled most of the troops out of there after we took the Hoover Dam.
AID00130542	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
AID00130543	Was an airport before the war. Command liked it because it was already fortified and it let them keep an eye on the Strip.
AID00130544	They've got an old monorail that still runs between them. Used mostly for supplies and deployment. But if you get leave you're allowed to go gamble.
AID00130545	Was General Oliver's post, but I heard he's been up at the Dam a lot lately. Guessing Colonel Hsu is running it.
AID00130546	Is that a First Recon beret?
AID00130547	Yeah. You can tell by the patch. Bear skull with crossed rifles behind it. Slogan underneath.
AID00130548	What's the slogan?
AID00130549	"The last thing you never see."
AID00130550	Pretty accurate, and so were we.
AID00130551	How did you happen to join First Recon?
AID00130552	They pick you out if you do well at the firing range. Pays a little better, so I said okay.
AID00130553	What outfit did you serve in the military with?
AID00130554	First NCR Recon. It's a sniper battalion. Sees a lot of action.
AID00130555	They moved us around a lot. I was stationed at Camp Golf for a while. Last I heard they were at Camp McCarran.
AID00130556	I'd like to talk about something else.
AID00130557	That's not how I want to approach this. You'd better go your own way for now.
AID00130558	Better be a good reason. I didn't join up with you to go on nature walks.
AID00130559	I'm not ready to attack it. We'll keep our distance.
AID00130560	If you're sure. There's a lot of high ground around the town. We could do a lot of damage.
AID00130561	Just saying.
AID00130562	No, that's not a problem. That's a solution.
AID00130563	Damn right. You and I, we're just a couple of problem solvers.
AID00130564	I'm ready. Caesar won't know what hit him.
AID00130565	That's what the scope's for.
AID00130566	No, I'm not going in right now.
AID00130567	You ever change your mind, I'll be right there with you.
AID00130568	Yes, but you're not coming with me.
AID00130569	You're making a mistake. I want to be a part of this.
AID00130570	I don't want any trouble. We should part ways for now.
AID00130571	Fine. But if you make any new friends in there, all bets are off.
AID00130572	As long as you don't mind me joining the fun.
AID00130573	I don't think I'd hold it against you.
AID00130574	Don't worry, I'm not going in there right now.
AID00130575	Okay. But let's make sure and come back here. I'd love to wipe this place off the map.
AID00130576	I'm ready. When will the President be here?
AID00130577	Looks like that's his vertibird coming right now. It's show time, let's not mess this up.
AID00130578	Now if you'll excuse me I've got some security procedures to oversee.
AID00130579	<Starting Converstation for VMQ03a>
AID00130580	I've heard of you. I'm glad you're here to help us out. This is a delicate matter and we need all the help we can get from people we can trust.
AID00130581	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
AID00130582	So you're the one Mr. House sent. His Securitron here informed me of what's going on.
AID00130583	Since Mr. House has helped me in the past, I'll let you help us during the President's visit. However, I will be keeping an eye on you.
AID00130584	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
AID00130585	So you're the one Colonel Moore sent to help out with the President's visit. Well, I'm running security for the visit, which means I'm in charge.
AID00130586	If anything goes down, you tell me first, you got that?
AID00130587	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
AID00130588	Are you ready?
AID00130589	I want one of their heads.
AID00130590	I'll be going now.
AID00130591	Can you let them go?
AID00130592	I'm here about the hostages.
AID00130593	I just wandered in here.
AID00130594	I'm looking for a howitzer firing mechanism.
AID00130595	You may find one in the workshop. You're a friend to the tribe, so I trust it will not find it's way into the wrong hands.
AID00130596	They are too rare and valuable to simply give away, nor have you proven yourself a friend.
AID00130597	Okay. Let's fight.
AID00130598	No, imbecile, that's not how it works. I set up the fights, then you go in the arena and fight.
AID00130599	Moo! That's what Brahmin say.
AID00130600	They do say that! I guess you can be my friend.
AID00130601	Um... can you help me?
AID00130602	<Attack> Ave Caesar!
AID00130603	Legion!
AID00130604	Legion's attacked Nipton, burned and killed everyone.
AID00130605	What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They...they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
AID00130606	...we'll never stop them, not at this rate. We're doomed. Thanks for bringing the word - even if the news is bad, I'll let the men know.
AID00130607	All right, come along.
AID00130608	You'll be glad you did this. I'm gonna put a hole through Caesar's head.
AID00130609	I'm going to do this my way. I can't bring you.
AID00130610	You say so.

AID00130614	If I was the assassin, I'd be up on that ridge. Or if I didn't care about escaping, maybe that near tower, or the landing pad behind us.
AID00130615	Okay, I'll see what I can do.
AID00130616	Thanks. Anything else?
AID00130617	LtMarklandNullLink
AID00130618	Doctor's Bags would be a huge help too.
AID00130619	I think that should just about cover us. I really don't know how to thank you, bringing me these supplies saved a lot of people.
AID00130620	Let me think about it.
AID00130621	Let me know if you change your mind.
AID00130622	Just letting you know.
AID00130623	Wasting my time is more like it.

AID00130630	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
AID00130631	I refuse to disarm.
AID00130632	This is your last warning. You will relinquish your weapons and banned items, or prepare to face the consequences.
AID00130633	You can pry my weapons from my cold dead hands.
AID00130634	This fool challenges the Legion, brothers! Let us teach him some manners!
AID00130635	I will return to Cottonwood Cove.
AID00130636	Very well. Lucullus, escort this fool back to Cottonwood Cove.
AID00130637	That just means we've got more work to do.
AID00130638	Yeah, it does. But we got these bastards pretty good today.
AID00130639	Why wouldn't this stop the Legion?
AID00130640	Intel we had back in the NCR said they had a whole succession lined up. They'll replace him as soon as word gets out.
AID00130641	The other thing I heard is that he wasn't really commanding the army anymore. Guess we made sure of that.
AID00130642	Still feels pretty good, though, doesn't it?
AID00130643	Heh. Yeah. That was some kind of stunt we pulled.
AID00130644	Whatever happens from here on out, we killed that prick in the middle of his fortress.
AID00130645	Ought to give the rest of them something to think about.
AID00130646	Goodbye.
AID00130647	Bye!
AID00130648	That's it for now.

AID00130664	To hell with mercy killing. We're getting those guys out of there.
AID00130665	What incident?
AID00130666	About three years ago, this canyon was the main encampment for the Great Khans. NCR's 1st Recon tracked them here after a raid and made an attack.
AID00130667	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
AID00130668	You mean the massacre three years ago?
AID00130669	The incident, yes. It was a tragic mistake, but the NCR has done everything it can to make amends since then.
AID00130670	<Lie> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
AID00130671	[SUCCEEDED] As you wish.
AID00130672	<Truth> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
AID00130673	[SUCCEEDED] As you wish.
AID00130674	[FAILED] I don't think so. If you work for the NCR, you're no better than they are. Flails of God!
AID00130675	It was a Great Khan named Oscar Velasco. His family was killed by the NCR, and he wanted revenge.
AID00130676	Ah. I should have expected as much. There's still a lot of bad blood between the Khans and the NCR, ever since the incident here.
AID00130677	Really? Well, this canyon used to be a Great Khan stronghold, I suppose that explains why he was able to evade us so easily.
AID00130678	It was a Great Khan raider. He had a base camp in a cave up in the mountains.
AID00130679	<Give 2 Doctor's Bags> I brought you these Doctor's Bags. I hope they help.
AID00130680	These will be a big help, thanks.
AID00130681	<Give 3 Doctor's Bags> I brought you these Doctor's Bags. I hope they help.

AID00131011	Who won the second Battle of Hoover Dam?
AID00131012	How's business?
AID00131013	I do decent enough. The NCR patrols usually stop by for a quick bite, and travelers like yourself pass by a couple times a week.
AID00131014	Goodbye.
AID00131015	Good luck to ya.
AID00131016	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00131017	Yeah.
AID00131018	Do you get a lot of customers?
AID00131019	The caravans or NCR patrols usually don't stop, but we usually get people like yourself wandering on by a few times a week.
AID00131020	Goodbye.
AID00131021	Vale.
AID00131022	I can teach you to make Powder Charges.
AID00131023	If they're more powerful than the Profligates' landmines, by all means show me how.
AID00131024	Study this as long as you need. <Show him the Powder Charge schematic.>
AID00131025	Tin cans, gunpowder, scrap metal, and duct tape? We won't have any trouble finding those ingredients!
AID00131026	I can show you how to disarm the NCR's mines.
AID00131027	That would be worth knowing, especially if we can then rearm and reuse them.
AID00131028	<Player teaches Severus how to disarm NCR munitions>
AID00131029	[SUCCEEDED] The light is a button that can interrupt detonation? We were too busy throwing ourselves to the ground to figure that out.
AID00131030	To rearm the mine, we'd just press the button again - simple. The Profligates will regret that we learned this.
AID00131031	The trick is to rush the mine and press the blinking red light.
AID00131032	[FAILED] Go find a minefield and practice that "trick" several times, then. Idiot.
AID00131033	The trick, I figure, is to pick up the mine really, really carefully.
AID00131034	Another time, perhaps.
AID00131035	If you have nothing to teach, don't make the offer.
AID00131036	I have dog tags to turn in.
AID00131037	Your Centurion said I could trade dog tags for supplies.
AID00131038	What of it?
AID00131039	I have dog tags to turn in.
AID00131040	Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about your skills. You've killed more NCR than most recruits.
AID00131041	Good, good! Your growing number of NCR kills rivals most legionaries.
AID00131042	Keep up the good work!
AID00131043	Ha! Perhaps I was wrong about your skills, Profligate. Your kill count rivals some of our best warriors!
AID00131044	How many?
AID00131045	Does the Legion see much action here?
AID00131046	As much as the Profligates' cowardice will allow. They haven't found the balls to attack us here, but we catch them out on patrols.
AID00131047	With two contubernia at my command, I've killed and captured four times my numbers.
AID00131048	That's some armor you're wearing.
AID00131049	It is the armor of a Centurion. You have the rare honor of beholding it unspattered by the blood of my inferiors.
AID00131050	An NCR officer asked me to plant this listening device here. <Give Aurelius the NCR bug>
AID00131051	The things the Profligates will build, to spy on us like cowards with little machines!
AID00131052	Find that officer and give him this old map of our patrol routes. The Profligates will try to set up ambushes... and we'll be waiting for them.
AID00131053	Goodbye.
AID00131054	Vale.
AID00131055	You must be the one in charge here.
AID00131056	Of course I am, you fool. I am a Centurion!
AID00131057	When Vulpes Inculta drove the NCR from Searchlight by clever means, Caesar himself ordered me to set up this camp and harass the Profligates!
AID00131058	It's a modest presence, a single finger of the Legion reaching across the river's narrows. But with me here, it has an iron knuckle.
AID00131059	I have dog tags to turn in.
AID00131060	Goodbye.
AID00131061	Vale.
AID00131062	Goodbye.
AID00131063	Bye.
AID00131064	[Attack] You're less trouble to me dead than alive.
AID00131065	Good thing I'm still alive, then.
AID00131066	All right. I won't do anything else to hurt the NCR.
AID00131067	You're right. You won't.
AID00131068	Then we can't work together anymore.
AID00131069	I should never have worked with you in the first place.
AID00131070	Sorry. I won't compromise my mission.
AID00131071	Then we're finished here.
AID00131072	Very well. You have my word.
AID00131073	All right. But we'd better not have to have this talk again.
AID00131074	[Attack] I won't be needing your services any longer.
AID00131075	I should never have trusted you.
AID00131076	Things have changed. I'm with Caesar now.
AID00131077	Then this is over. Next time I see you, it'll be through my scope.
AID00131078	Any Legion with you and I'm pulling the trigger.
AID00131079	It won't happen again.
AID00131080	I'm... uh... helping them so I can spy on them better.
AID00131081	Bullshit. You're a goddamned coward, trying to pick the winning side.
AID00131082	We will never work together again.
AID00131083	I'm infiltrating the organization. I have to gain their trust.
AID00131084	If you want me to stick around, that ends now. I don't care what the reasons are, I will not help the Legion. Ever. Got it?
AID00131085	Why are you surprised to see a woman receive this honor?
AID00131086	Women are physically and intellectually inferior to men. Their role is to bear children and ensure the survival of our species.
AID00131087	Not to say that all women are equally incapable. I trust Caesar will find a worthy use for you.
AID00131088	Goodbye.
AID00131089	Vale, as you wish. My orders are to wait here until you're ready to make the trip.
AID00131090	What have I done to earn this honor?
AID00131091	You'd know better than I would. But you must be remarkable, for Caesar to take such an interest.
AID00131092	Who are you calling "Dissolute?"
AID00131093	All who are not Legion are "Dissolute." They live in squalor, unrestrained by morality, lacking moderation, temper, and self-control.
AID00131094	Their very existence is a blight on the common good. Even worse are the Profligates, the subtype of Dissolute one finds this side of the river.
AID00131095	They hold themselves to be civilized, when in fact they are corrupt and self-interested. The truth will be made clear to them soon enough.
AID00131096	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
AID00131097	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
AID00131098	Goodbye.
AID00131099	Momma...
AID00131100	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
AID00131101	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
AID00131102	I see. Well, that's too bad. Good luck.
AID00131103	Thanks. Your concern is touching.
AID00131104	Why are there so many Great Khan tags around the camp?
AID00131105	This whole area used to be a Great Khan encampment before they relocated to Red Rock Canyon. We just haven't had the manpower to clean it all up yet.
AID00131106	Any idea why a Great Khan would be so far from Red Rock Canyon?
AID00131107	About three years ago, NCR's 1st Recon launched an attack on the Khan encampment here.
AID00131108	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. I guess he was still bitter about it.
AID00131109	It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
AID00131110	That's very noble of you. I'd like to talk about something else though.
AID00131111	Sure. What do you need?
AID00131112	Well, it's taken care of now. I convinced him to leave Bitter Springs alone.
AID00131113	I don't know how you did it, but thank you.
AID00131114	I'm glad it's taken care of, but still, I wish it could have been resolved without violence. There's too much bad blood there already.
AID00131115	Well, it's taken care of now. He's dead.
AID00131116	Like what? It looks to me like the NCR ran the Khans out of Bitter Springs altogether.
AID00131117	We provided medical aid to the wounded - all the wounded - and permitted the Khans to resettle at Red Rock Canyon.
AID00131118	Goodbye.
AID00131119	One of these days we'll be free.
AID00131120	Do you have any "captures" with the last name, "Weathers?"
AID00131121	Captures lose any claim to the names they called themselves when they let themselves be taken.
AID00131122	If they're fortunate enough to become slaves, a new name will be given to them - one they can be proud of.
AID00131123	It was an accident.
AID00131124	Accident or not, you're to blame!
AID00131125	Goodbye.
AID00131126	Bye.
AID00131127	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
AID00131128	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
AID00131129	<Lie> I paid for your release. You're free to go.
AID00131130	[SUCCEEDED] Finally! Let's get out of here!
AID00131131	[FAILED] I don't believe you. This key has to have been stolen.
AID00131132	None of the guards have said we're free to go. As soon as we step out of here, we're just going to get caught again, or worse.
AID00131133	I took care of your master. You're free as a bird.
AID00131134	<Give Mrs. Weathers the key from Canyon Runner>
AID00131135	Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
AID00131136	Who is Cursor Lucullus?
AID00131137	The best Cursor in the Legion. You'll reach Fortification Hill without incident, that's for sure.
AID00131138	Wait until you see the encampment, how massive it is. And a personal audience with mighty Caesar - glorious!
AID00131139	Goodbye.
AID00131140	Vale.
AID00131141	How did you join Caesar's Legion?
AID00131142	I have Blackfoot in me, the first tribe that Caesar ever led in battle - the tribe that formed the Legion.
AID00131143	If not for him, we'd still be living in tents or shacks, scavenging for food like animals. If we were alive at all.
AID00131144	How did the Legion set up a camp on this side of the river?
AID00131145	It was easy. The Colorado is narrow here, and when the Profligates abandoned Searchlight, there was no one to guard the crossing.
AID00131146	It's just a small outpost, but we keep busy. Raiding parties go out, new captures come in.
AID00131147	I'll give you 150 caps for the lot.
AID00131148	Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
AID00131149	Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
AID00131150	This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
AID00131151	How much would it cost to buy the three "captures"?
AID00131152	It's a weak bunch, to be honest. I'd rather have extra currency to buy supplies or better captures off traders.
AID00131153	There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
AID00131154	The old woman's dried up, but she could keep house or do gardening - if she can learn to keep her mouth shut.
AID00131155	The girl's the only one of real value, young enough to breed, not hideous to look at. What's your offer for the lot?
AID00131156	It doesn't bother you, enslaving people?
AID00131157	Why would it bother me to enslave these wretches? They have no purpose, no creed, no honor.
AID00131158	They live in pitiful squalor, undisciplined, intemperate. To enslave them is to save them - to give them purpose, and virtue.
AID00131159	Honestas, Industria, Prudentia - even the virtues of slaves are beyond the Dissolute on this side of the river.
AID00131160	What happened to your family?
AID00131161	We were crossing the Mojave, not far from Searchlight, when a band of Caesar's Legion slavers came out of nowhere. They took my family.
AID00131162	Caesar's Legion attacked us near Searchlight. The rangers say they probably took my family to Cottonwood Cove.
AID00131163	Remind me what happened to your family.
AID00131164	About your family...
AID00131165	Yes? Have you found them?
AID00131166	Why'd you come all the way out to New Vegas?
AID00131167	Why does anybody? I thought I'd strike it rich at the tables, make my fortune and never have to plow those damn fields again.
AID00131168	I just wanted to provide for my family - and now they're gone. All gone. God forgive me....
AID00131169	What do you know about the Legion?
AID00131170	They're cannibals, slavers, and worse.
AID00131171	I hear rumors they're poised to overrun the entire Colorado River Valley, and even the Army won't be enough to stop them.
AID00131172	One of the officers here, or at Camp McCarran, might be able to tell you more.
AID00131173	Who are you?
AID00131174	My name's Frank Weathers. I'm a farmer, got a few hundred acres near Junktown. Well, I was a farmer. I guess I'm not much of anything now.
AID00131175	Why can't I just continue on?
AID00131176	Caesar strictly forbids the use of chems and alcohol. By his order, all visitors must also relinquish their arms upon entry.
AID00131177	If you come in peace, then there is no reason to not disarm. You will not be harmed unless Caesar wills it.
AID00131178	I'm ready to return to Cottonwood Cove.
AID00131179	Very well.
AID00131180	What is considered a banned item?
AID00131181	Alcohol and all chems, including stims and other addictive items.
AID00131182	What do you do around here?
AID00131183	I do odd jobs here and there, usually helping Sarah keep the Vault tidy. I came to New Vegas to be a professional gambler.
AID00131184	Too bad for me that the "professional" part isn't working out so good. But, I love gambling, so I'm here to stay on the Strip until they kick me out.
AID00131185	Let's talk about something else now.
AID00131186	Okay.
AID00131187	Dangerous work.
AID00131188	It isn't normally. The NCR wanted me to just gamble and listen, nothing else.
AID00131189	So, you're a spy.
AID00131190	No! Well, not really. I mean, I'm not listening through doors or sneaking around or anything. People talk out loud, and I just pay attention.
AID00131191	The NCR likes to keep tabs on the activities of the families, and they pay me good caps to hang around the casinos and keep my ears open.
AID00131192	You work with the NCR? It was the Legion who sent me to protect you.
AID00131193	What? I only talk to Captain Curtis over at McCarran. I would never work with slavers. Honest.
AID00131194	Save your thanks - this was a job, nothing more.
AID00131195	Oh. Um... okay.
AID00131196	Goodbye.
AID00131197	Goodbye!
AID00131198	Why were the Omertas out to kill you?
AID00131199	I... may have overheard some things at Gomorrah that I passed on to the NCR. That's all! Honest.
AID00131200	You were lucky. I might not be around next time.
AID00131201	There won't be a next time. I hope.
AID00131202	Are you all right?
AID00131203	I'll be fine... eventually.
AID00131204	<Speech for allowing meds>
AID00131205	[SUCCEEDED] I know not why Caesar would wish to speak with such a physically inferior whelp, but I will allow this one exception.
AID00131206	You may bear Caesar's mark, but do not attempt to share any of your medicine with anyone in The Fort.
AID00131207	I have to bring them along, a congenital heart defect.
AID00131208	[FAILED] Thus is Caesar's will. Do not test my patience.
AID00131209	But medical chems aren't addictive! Really!
AID00131210	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
AID00131211	Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
AID00131212	Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
AID00131213	How were you captured?
AID00131214	My family was ambushed by a pack of Legion raiders near Searchlight and Frank ran off, the gutless coward!
AID00131215	I have no idea where he is, but at least we're free from his abuse.
AID00131216	Tell me again what you know about the target.
AID00131217	Violet's got dogs. Lots of dogs. While they're ripping you to shreds up close, she'll be putting rounds through you with her rifle.
AID00131218	Driver Nephi is a monster in close combat with that golf club of his, and that man is about as fast on his feet as any Legionary.
AID00131219	If you haven't already, see about getting Gorobets and First Recon to help you - they've got things to settle with Driver Nephi, too.
AID00131220	Cook-Cook loves using his flamethrower on his victims, usually after he rapes them. Little Buster can tell you more about him than I can, though.
AID00131221	I've got other questions.
AID00131222	Sure, but make them quick.
AID00131223	I dragged myself all over Hell's half-acre for you, I expect something substantial!
AID00131224	If a reward is all you're concerned with, here. Enjoy it.
AID00131225	Whatever you can spare would be a big help.
AID00131226	Here, take this. I hope you put it to good use.
AID00131227	I don't need any reward, just keep these people fed and healthy.
AID00131228	That's very generous of you. I appreciate it.
AID00131229	[Reputation] I've done a lot for the Legion. Just hand over the bear already.
AID00131230	Yeah, I guess you're right. Here.
AID00131231	Those books were pretty expensive. Maybe you can cough up a little more?
AID00131232	Really? Wow. Well, you did pay for them, so here you go. Thanks again for everything.
AID00131233	Thanks, that should cover my expenses.
AID00131234	No problem, here you go. I'm kind of amazed you found them at all. Thanks again for everything.
AID00131235	Some spare meds would be great - and those books weren't cheap.
AID00131236	Oh! Right, of course, I can give you a few spare meds and a few caps. Here.
AID00131237	Well, if you've got a surplus, maybe you could spare a little medicine?
AID00131238	Oh! Oh, yeah, sure, I think I can spare a little. Here. And thanks again.
AID00131239	Don't sweat it, I was glad to help.
AID00131240	Well, still. Thanks again.
AID00131241	What happened to the mayor?
AID00131242	Him? When his ticket came up, they burned him alive on a pile of tires.
AID00131243	Do you remember the message you were told to spread?
AID00131244	The message? You know about that...?
AID00131245	There was some kind of message, but... I don't seem to remember it.
AID00131246	Yeah... that air! Smell it!
AID00131247	Who are you?
AID00131248	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
AID00131249	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
AID00131250	Tell me about Caesar.
AID00131251	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AID00131252	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
AID00131253	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
AID00131254	Who is this Legatus you mention?
AID00131255	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
AID00131256	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
AID00131257	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
AID00131258	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
AID00131259	I've heard enough.
AID00131260	I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
AID00131261	Why, then, do you keep asking?
AID00131262	You slaughtered innocent civilians?
AID00131263	Innocent? Hardly.
AID00131264	Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
AID00131265	They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
AID00131266	They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
AID00131267	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
AID00131268	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
AID00131269	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00131270	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
AID00131271	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00131272	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
AID00131273	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
AID00131274	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00131275	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of them, in due time.
AID00131276	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00131277	You captured everyone?
AID00131278	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
AID00131279	I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
AID00131280	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
AID00131281	What exactly happened here?
AID00131282	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
AID00131283	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers, men of the Legion such as myself - the people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
AID00131284	For a pittance, the town agreed to lead those it had sheltered into a trap. Only when I sprang it did they realize they were caught inside it, too.
AID00131285	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
AID00131286	Legionaries?! We have a problem!
AID00131287	Your "civilization" sounds like a pack of snarling dogs.
AID00131288	Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
AID00131289	How can I serve the Legion?
AID00131290	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
AID00131291	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
AID00131292	Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
AID00131293	That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
AID00131294	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
AID00131295	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
AID00131296	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
AID00131297	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
AID00131298	What "lessons" did you teach here?
AID00131299	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AID00131300	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AID00131301	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AID00131302	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AID00131303	Your crimes are unforgivable.
AID00131304	As are all crimes. If you feel strongly about it, attack us, and soon you won't feel a thing.
AID00131305	So you've said.
AID00131306	You're the guy who won the lottery.
AID00131307	Lottery? You remember the lottery?
AID00131308	Goddamn you! I don't need to remember that!
AID00131309	Are you a Powder Ganger?
AID00131310	Powder Ganger? What? I mean, yeah, used to be, sure!
AID00131311	But not no more! Powder Gang is small-time, man! I'm a winner! I won the motherfucking lottery!
AID00131312	I don't have any Med-X for you.
AID00131313	Bullshit. You're holding, you just want it all for yourself!
AID00131314	Five doses.
AID00131315	Five doses? Nice. A fella could put himself out of his misery with five doses.
AID00131316	Three doses.
AID00131317	Three doses? That's almost enough for a party.
AID00131318	Two doses.
AID00131319	Good enough. Hand it over.
AID00131320	One dose.
AID00131321	Big fucking deal. Hand it over.
AID00131322	I can spare some Med-X.
AID00131323	Then you're a fucking dream come true, ain't ya? How much you gonna give me?
AID00131324	It's not my problem.
AID00131325	That's how I figure it. Got problems of my own to handle.
AID00131326	I'll do what I can to save them.
AID00131327	Don't act like you'd be doing me a favor. I don't give a fuck.
AID00131328	You said some of the people were enslaved?
AID00131329	Yeah, a bunch of those Legion fucks dragged them off right away. They was headed East, if you're feeling heroic.
AID00131330	What happened after everyone got lottery tickets?
AID00131331	What do you think? He started drawing tickets, and that's how people got punished.
AID00131332	First up was the "lucky losers." They got decapitated - guess that's "lucky" because it's pretty quick.
AID00131333	Then came the crucifixions. Goddamn but those went on and on and on...
AID00131334	Third-place runners-up got enslaved. I got the fuck beat out of my legs, and the winner they let go free.
AID00131335	Let's talk about something else.
AID00131336	Like what?
AID00131337	How'd your plan go wrong?
AID00131338	We get in position and next thing we know, we're surrounded by those fucking Legion freaks.
AID00131339	They dragged us and everybody else into the center of town. And that asshole with a dog on his head, he starts talking about how we're bad people!
AID00131340	He said we needed to be punished for what we did, not all of us, but some of us. And then he gives everyone a fucking lottery ticket...
AID00131341	You live out here by yourself?
AID00131342	Sure do. Had a wife for awhile - tribal girl, really pretty eyes - but she's been gone a long time now.
AID00131343	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00131344	Well, ain't like I've got places to be.
AID00131345	So, are you a cannibal?
AID00131346	Ha. I'm not saying. It's part of my mystique, after all.
AID00131347	I'm still not saying.
AID00131348	Tell me about yourself.
AID00131349	What do you want to know?
AID00131350	<Be mean>
AID00131351	What?! Why won't you tell me?
AID00131352	Did my wife put you up to this?! What lies did she tell you?
AID00131353	Why would I tell an abusive bastard like you?
AID00131354	<Barter>
AID00131355	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I don't have much left at this point. Please, just tell me where they are.
AID00131356	Show me some caps and I'll tell you exactly where to go.
AID00131357	Hey thanks, Frank. Go to hell.
AID00131358	Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
AID00131359	<Speech - Confront>
AID00131360	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
AID00131361	It won't be easy, but I'll try going sober. Maybe then my family will want me back.
AID00131362	Thank you for doing what you can. I won't let this go to waste.
AID00131363	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up, Frank.
AID00131364	[FAILED] They're my blood, man. You don't just walk away from your blood!
AID00131365	They hate you. Get over it.
AID00131366	[FAILED] They're my blood, lady. You don't just walk away from your blood!
AID00131367	They hate you. Get over it.
AID00131368	<Speech - Anger>
AID00131369	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
AID00131370	What am I supposed to do? I've got no money left, and now my family has abandoned me.
AID00131371	You're a slimy yellow-bellied bastard. You don't deserve a family!
AID00131372	[FAILED] Well look who is all high and mighty! You're no better than me when it boils down, bub.
AID00131373	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up your act.
AID00131374	They mentioned going to the Old Mormon Fort in Freeside.
AID00131375	Crap, those goody-goodies kicked me out of there once already. No way I'm getting in.
AID00131376	Even if I could get in, rehab is for chumps. Well, thanks for doing what you could.
AID00131377	Guess I'll get a fresh start and keep an eye out in case they leave the Fort.
AID00131378	Goodbye, Frank.
AID00131379	<Speech - Suicide>
AID00131380	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've got nothing left...
AID00131381	I'll never see my kids grow up, but they're better off without me.
AID00131382	Think about it, Frank. What do you have to live for?
AID00131383	[FAILED] You think you're better than me? You're just like those goody-goody Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00131384	You're scum, Frank. A real bottom-feeder.
AID00131385	<Speech>
AID00131386	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. You may proceed.
AID00131387	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
AID00131388	I'm just a humble trader passing through.
AID00131389	[FAILED] Tread lightly, fool. You are entering Caesar's land.
AID00131390	Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross. Turn back now, or pay the consequences.
AID00131391	Just thought I'd check the place out.
AID00131392	<Show Mark of Caesar> I was invited.
AID00131393	You wear the Mark of Caesar?! You must be who Cursor Lucullus is waiting for.
AID00131394	You may continue, but be warned. Mark or no, we will not tolerate aggressive action by visitors in the camp.
AID00131395	<Attack> I go where I please!
AID00131396	To arms, brothers!
AID00131397	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
AID00131398	Very well. You may proceed.
AID00131399	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
AID00131400	Fool. Your deeds are known well among us.
AID00131401	To arms, my brothers!
AID00131402	test
AID00131403	I have another question about you.
AID00131404	Sure.
AID00131405	Not anymore?
AID00131406	No.
AID00131407	When Carla went missing he was the first person I told.
AID00131408	He tried to hide it, but I could tell right away. He was glad.
AID00131409	Weren't you also friends?
AID00131410	Yeah. We were.
AID00131411	How do you feel about Manny Vargas?
AID00131412	Don't ever say that name again.
AID00131413	He was a good spotter.
AID00131414	Ever take that beret off?
AID00131415	No.
AID00131416	What's the best way for me to use your skills?
AID00131417	Give me my rifle and a clear line of sight and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
AID00131418	Didn't have much hand-to-hand training, so our chances are better if you keep the enemy out of my face.
AID00131419	I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I can find your targets for you.
AID00131420	Tell me about yourself.
AID00131421	If you want. It's not really my thing. What do you want to know?
AID00131422	VDialogueCraigBooneNiptonReact
AID00131423	They got what they had coming. Glad we were the ones to deliver it.
AID00131424	I had some questions I wanted to ask you.
AID00131425	Okay.
AID00131426	Did you ever tell your wife about what happened at Bitter Springs?
AID00131427	No. I wanted to. I just couldn't.
AID00131428	Tell me about your wife.
AID00131429	Carla's dead. That's all you need to know.
AID00131430	I met Carla while I was at the Strip on leave. She said I looked lost.
AID00131431	She talked a lot. Suited me fine - I never know what to say. And listening to her, it could... make you forget.
AID00131432	She stuck out, pretty much everywhere we went. Like she was from a different time. A better time. I never met anyone like her.
AID00131433	VDialogueCraigBooneSpotterIntro
AID00131434	Dark in here. If you want to use a scope, I can spot for you. Keep you on target.
AID00131435	I have a different question.
AID00131436	Any thoughts about Caesar's Legion?
AID00131437	Yeah. Lots of thoughts. All about the best ways to kill them.
AID00131438	How do you feel about the NCR?
AID00131439	Coming east was about securing the land, so people could live without fear.
AID00131440	It's not always that simple. But I think the cause is still right.
AID00131441	And God help us if they lose.
AID00131442	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
AID00131443	It's NCR land, for the most part. We tamed it, now we're settling it.
AID00131444	Lot of people complain about it, but they forget what it was like before we showed up.
AID00131445	It's a lot of territory to secure. Too much, even for a big army like the NCR's.
AID00131446	Does the name Benny mean anything to you?
AID00131447	No. It doesn't.
AID00131448	Have you heard of Mr. House?
AID00131449	Yeah. I don't know much. Just rumors.
AID00131450	All I know is he's supposed to be in charge of the Strip. And he's been able to stop the NCR from taking it over.
AID00131451	Wish he'd give it up, so the NCR could focus on securing the border.
AID00131452	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
AID00131453	So I'm supposed to just start giving in to the demands of random strangers that come in here, huh? I don't think so.
AID00131454	You want something from me, you're gonna have to earn it. And it just so happens that I've got a few things I need taken care of. So what do you say?
AID00131455	I'd love to help you, but it seems I can't even prevent my own friends from getting killed. I'm sorry as can be, but I can't help you.
AID00131456	Notice anything suspicious?
AID00131457	Nope. Haven't noticed anything strange at all. Neither has my friend here, and he has a good nose for these things.
AID00131458	Not since the last time you asked, no.
AID00131459	Nice looking dog you have there.
AID00131460	Thanks. We haven't been paired together long, but he's a smart dog.
AID00131461	I found an assassin in the tower.
AID00131462	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
AID00131463	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
AID00131464	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
AID00131465	Nothing to report.
AID00131466	Then stay off the line and get back to work!
AID00131467	I found a Legion sniper on the roof of the tower.
AID00131468	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
AID00131469	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
AID00131470	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
AID00131471	I'll see what I can do.
AID00131472	Thank you! Thank you so much!
AID00131473	VHDIntakeTowerCenturionBarks
AID00131474	Move it, you curs!
AID00131475	There's still more killing to be done!
AID00131476	Keep moving!
AID00131477	I will personally gut the first man to slow down!
AID00131478	Leave none alive!
AID00131479	
AID00131480	[SUCCEEDED] Agreed. If we take the power plant, this battle is over. I'll have my men focus their efforts there. May the Son of Mars go with you.
AID00131481	The power plant is what really matters. Have all of your men attack there. I'll finish things here.
AID00131482	[FAILED] Forgive my appraisal of your prowess, but all the same I'd rather send some of my men with you to help secure the dam top.
AID00131483	Pffft. I can handle things here. You and your men can hold the power plant until I get there.
AID00131484	
AID00131485	[SUCCEEDED] Your words have merit... Very well. I shall tell my men to concentrate their efforts here.
AID00131486	It is imperative we secure the dam top. Instead of dividing your men, focus their attack here.
AID00131487	[FAILED] I have my orders, and they explicitly state that I am to divide my men.
AID00131488	Screw that. I need all your men dying fo- er, backing me up here.
AID00131489	I have to keep moving. Kill a few of them for me.
AID00131490	More than a few, if I have my way.
AID00131491	What news of the battle below?
AID00131492	The fighting in the power plant is the fiercest, as expected. But the dogs have been caught off guard, and their positions can expect no support.
AID00131493	However, the pipes below have been sealed, cutting off our men until the dam top can be secured.
AID00131494	I've been diverting half of my men to the tower next to this one. It's a bit of a swim, but the enemy hasn't sealed those pipes yet.
AID00131495	Some of the other centuriae are more stubborn in following their orders exactly, though, and wait in the pipes below.
AID00131496	If you should make it down there, unsealing the pipes again will allow us to spill over the enemy like a tide of blood.
AID00131497	Report, centurion. What are your standing orders?
AID00131498	My men await in the tunnel below. I am to divide them between the dam top and the tunnels that lead to the western power plant.
AID00131499	Something's wrong with my cyber-dog. I was told to come to you.
AID00131500	It's neural degradation. Bio med gel can only preserve a living brain for so long, so you'll need to find a replacement.
AID00131501	I haven't left Jacobstown in years, but there was one woman in Novac... Gibson? I remember her living with a pack of hounds.
AID00131502	Aside from her, I know that the Fiends and Caesar's Legion fight alongside dogs. There could be viable specimens among them, if you can get to them.
AID00131503	I don't see him with you. Bring him to me and I'll take a look. Otherwise, I'll just be guessing.
AID00131504	Warning 2
AID00131505	I warned you. Intruder!
AID00131506	Warning 1
AID00131507	Only engineers and authorized personnel are allowed upstairs. Please step away.
AID00131508	I can manage this without your assistance.
AID00131509	Confirmed, we'll fall back. Good luck.
AID00131510	<Speech Options>
AID00131511	You are in charge of this operation. That sounds like a suicide mission, but our order are to take commands from you.
AID00131512	Unit, let's move out!
AID00131513	You have superior firepower. You can overwhelm them if you push the advance on them.
AID00131514	We aren't assigned for a suicide mission. Give us something we can do, and we'll do it. However I am not sending my unit on a suicide run.
AID00131515	You go first. I'll be right behind you.
AID00131516	Have your unit follow with me, we'll assault them head on.
AID00131517	Confirmed. We'll stay with you and help you break through the line.
AID00131518	I need some snipers to cover my advance.
AID00131519	Roger that. I'll have snipers move to position.
AID00131520	Let's talk about something else.
AID00131521	If we must.
AID00131522	I'd like to help. What do you need me to do?
AID00131523	I'm not convinced that the Nightstalker mutation is a natural one, and I need someone to investigate their lair for proof.
AID00131524	Some of the Super Mutants have looked around as well, but they've come back empty-handed. Perhaps a pair of fresh eyes will have better luck.
AID00131525	Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
AID00131526	Why are you helping the Nightkin?
AID00131527	Because Marcus asked me to and because it's a reason for me to get up in the morning. I'd like to get one more grand accomplishment done.
AID00131528	Does Stealth Boy use hurt humans?
AID00131529	It's possible, but I've yet to see any hard evidence or hear of any cases where humans were negatively affected.
AID00131530	Its negative effects are more pronounced on Nightkin.
AID00131531	What are you working on?
AID00131532	I'm surprised to find another human here.
AID00131533	I have a new brain for Rex.
AID00131534	Very well, show me what you've brought so that I can analyze its potential.
AID00131535	And your cyber-dog is... where, exactly? I can't perform the operation without him, hopefully for obvious reasons.
AID00131536	vFreeformHooverDamCommanderGreeting
AID00131537	Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
AID00131538	No more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00131539	Let's talk about something else.
AID00131540	All right.
AID00131541	Tell me more about the tribal.
AID00131542	We were looking for a GECK to save the village of Arroyo. Eventually, we did. Nuked an oil rig in the process.
AID00131543	We went separate ways after that. I went east into the Rockies, looking for other mutants like myself.
AID00131544	Don't know what happened to my friend. I've got a feeling it turned out all right in the end.
AID00131545	You were a mayor?
AID00131546	Town was Broken Hills. Bunch of Super Mutants, humans, and Ghouls all living together peacefully. Well, most of the time.
AID00131547	Super Mutant army?
AID00131548	Long story, so here's the short version. The Master created the Super Mutants and Nightkin.
AID00131549	The Master thought he could unify everyone. No more differences, no more war. Didn't end well.
AID00131550	I'd like to know about you.
AID00131551	Was part of Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
AID00131552	What's the history of Jacobstown?
AID00131553	Was a resort Pre-War. I renamed it to Jacobstown after an old friend. Died a long time ago.
AID00131554	I figured us mutants needed a place to call our own. Town's far enough away from humans so they don't bother us much.
AID00131555	One of these days I'm hoping we can trade with the rest of the wasteland. No more fighting, just... get along.
AID00131556	I had some questions about Jacobstown.
AID00131557	[Attack] Can't say I didn't try. Time to die!
AID00131558	Goodbye.
AID00131559	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
AID00131560	Goodbye.
AID00131561	These people will not put up with you forever.
AID00131562	Goodbye.
AID00131563	You can't really enjoy living here. Take 50 caps and get out of here.
AID00131564	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week of shaking down these assholes anyways.
AID00131565	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
AID00131566	[FAILED] You're shitting me. You got a real offer, or are you just going to waste my time?
AID00131567	How about if I pay you 100 caps to get out of here?
AID00131568	That'll do, yeah.
AID00131569	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
AID00131570	[Attack] I'm going to enjoy seeing you bleed.
AID00131571	Shit, you're crazy!
AID00131572	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
AID00131573	[Attack] I was hoping you'd be that stupid.
AID00131574	What? Hey, guys! Help me here!
AID00131575	These people won't put up with you forever.
AID00131576	[FAILED] Like I give a shit. Didn't I say get lost, or are you looking for a beating?
AID00131577	[SUCCEEDED] I don't... wait. You've got a point.
AID00131578	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
AID00131579	Locals are getting edgy. How long, you think, before you're gutted open by an angry mob?
AID00131580	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
AID00131581	You better make it worthwhile. I ain't going to risk my neck in The Wasteland for shit.
AID00131582	Goodbye.
AID00131583	[Attack] I'm looking at my next victim.
AID00131584	I hear you've been causing trouble.
AID00131585	Oh yeah? Fuck off, asshole.
AID00131586	Goodbye.
AID00131587	Now, let me ask you something else.
AID00131588	Goodbye.
AID00131589	Yeah... about my other questions.
AID00131590	Okay, I'll look into it.
AID00131591	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00131592	Babysitting isn't my thing.
AID00131593	This ain't "babysitting," stranger. I'm telling you, these people are nasty and Alice is in danger.
AID00131594	I'll check them out for you.
AID00131595	All right, we've got a deal then. I'll make sure to compensate you for your time, if you find anything useful.
AID00131596	Goodbye.
AID00131597	Let me ask you some questions.
AID00131598	So, you've got work for me?
AID00131599	<Questions General>
AID00131600	Okay, what's on your mind?
AID00131601	Goodbye.
AID00131602	I just want to ask you some questions.
AID00131603	Goodbye.
AID00131604	Goodbye.
AID00131605	<Attack> Okay, bitch. You asked for it.
AID00131606	<Attack> Okay, bitch. You asked for it.
AID00131607	You think I'm going to be easy, huh? Come get some, asshole!
AID00131608	I just want to ask you some questions.
AID00131609	Goodbye.
AID00131610	Get lost!
AID00131611	Goodbye, stranger.
AID00131612	I just want to ask you some questions.
AID00131613	Are you deaf? I don't give a damn about what you want. Just get out of here.
AID00131614	I mean you no harm.
AID00131615	Whatever you say, stranger. Go snoop somewhere else and get the fuck out of my house, right now!
AID00131616	<Questions about Quest>
AID00131617	If you're good at snooping around, then I could use you. I need to find out what my daughter's up to.
AID00131618	She's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
AID00131619	Crandon said you had a problem. I take care of problems.
AID00131620	He should really mind his own business. Crandon's good to keep scum in check, but he ain't exactly subtle.
AID00131621	Settle down. Crandon sent me.
AID00131622	He did, huh? All right, what do you want?
AID00131623	What do you do here?
AID00131624	What do you do here?
AID00131625	Outer Vegas ain't exactly a safe place. Despite our numbers, The Wasteland creeps through every nook and cranny.
AID00131626	I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
AID00131627	I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
AID00131628	Tell me again about what your role here.
AID00131629	What do you do here?
AID00131630	What do you do here?
AID00131631	Tell me more about your story.
AID00131632	Okay, so what's your story?
AID00131633	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131634	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131635	You look capable of defending yourself.
AID00131636	Goodbye.
AID00131637	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131638	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131639	Goodbye.
AID00131640	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131641	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131642	You look capable of defending yourself.
AID00131643	You look capable to defending yourself.
AID00131644	Tell me about your past.
AID00131645	Goodbye.
AID00131646	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131647	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131648	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131649	Goodbye.
AID00131650	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131651	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131652	Goodbye.
AID00131653	What's your opinion of the NCR?
AID00131654	What did you say before about the Fiends?
AID00131655	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131656	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131657	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131658	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131659	Goodbye.
AID00131660	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131661	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131662	Goodbye.
AID00131663	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131664	Goodbye.
AID00131665	Tell me about your past.
AID00131666	What can you tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131667	Goodbye.
AID00131668	What's your story?
AID00131669	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131670	Goodbye.
AID00131671	What's your story?
AID00131672	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131673	Did you say NCR whores?
AID00131674	What did you say before about the Fiends?
AID00131675	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131676	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131677	What's your opinion of the NCR?
AID00131678	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131679	Do you know where might I find them?
AID00131680	Try "The Gray." Beats me why people go into that forsaken thing. At least with huts and sewers you know they ain't crumbling on top of your head.
AID00131681	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131682	They're a bunch of lunatics, so pumped full of chems that they don't give a damn about life anymore. Fiends rape, kill and maim for the hell of it.
AID00131683	Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
AID00131684	Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
AID00131685	What did you say before about the Fiends?
AID00131686	Bad weeds don't die easy. Still, things will be safer now that you've taught a lesson to those crazies.
AID00131687	Any more trouble with the Fiends?
AID00131688	NCR whores?
AID00131689	You heard me. We don't like those stiff-back, clean-hand, little pussies. New Vegas belongs to the people.
AID00131690	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
AID00131691	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
AID00131692	What's your opinion of the NCR, again?
AID00131693	Goodbye.
AID00131694	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131695	Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her 'round here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
AID00131696	What's your story?
AID00131697	That's a long one, stranger. Let's just say I got tired of killing in The Wasteland and now I've found a better home for my old butt.
AID00131698	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131699	We're independent folks here. Merchants, gamblers, NCR whores, all of them trade with us and we offer protection against critters and the Fiends.
AID00131700	Goodbye.
AID00131701	Another time. Let me ask you some questions.
AID00131702	Goodbye.
AID00131703	Can I ask you other questions?
AID00131704	<Questions General>
AID00131705	Sure thing. What's on your noggin?
AID00131706	What's eating you?
AID00131707	Goodbye.
AID00131708	Can I ask you some questions?
AID00131709	You look capable of defending yourself.
AID00131710	[FAILED] I sure am, stranger. But there ain't anything about you that makes me want to go into details.
AID00131711	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a sharp eye on you. I take it you like guns, huh? Question is, can you handle more than just a weapon...
AID00131712	I see you can take care of yourself. Your revolver's trigger shines like silver.
AID00131713	Goodbye.
AID00131714	<Attack> I guess you'll have to find out the hard way.
AID00131715	You ain't too smart, are you? Okay, let's dance.
AID00131716	I'm just another Wasteland wanderer. Why the suspicion?
AID00131717	Goodbye.
AID00131718	All right... keep walking.
AID00131719	I'll see you again, stranger.
AID00131720	So long, warrior.
AID00131721	Relax, I only want to ask you some questions.
AID00131722	And I only asked first... I'll try one last time before I find out the hard way. Where you come from, and where you going?
AID00131723	I'm just another Wasteland wanderer. Why the suspicion?
AID00131724	Cause that's the law of the land. You never know when someone's going to stab you in the back... and I like mine upright.
AID00131725	Maybe one day, stranger, when you've seen all I've seen, done all I've done, you'll sooner trust a Radscorpion than a new face in The Wasteland.
AID00131726	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131727	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131728	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131729	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131730	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131731	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
AID00131732	Goodbye.
AID00131733	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131734	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131735	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131736	You look capable of defending yourself.
AID00131737	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131738	Goodbye.
AID00131739	What's the deal with the Fiends?
AID00131740	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00131741	You look capable of defending yourself.
AID00131742	Tell me about North Vegas.
AID00131743	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AID00131744	[Attack] I like where this is going.
AID00131745	I'm ready for you... Hey, guys, need a hand here!
AID00131746	I don't like your tone.
AID00131747	Goodbye.
AID00131748	I don't like your tone.
AID00131749	[Lie] I just thought Andy should know about Mrs. Hostetler waiting outside for him, shotgun in hand.
AID00131750	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler and Andy.
AID00131751	Goodbye.
AID00131752	I don't like your tone.
AID00131753	[Lie] I just thought Andy should know about Mrs. Hostetler waiting outside for him, shotgun in hand.
AID00131754	What? You've got to be kidding me... Fuck, why do I always gotta fix someone else's crap around here?
AID00131755	Goodbye.
AID00131756	I don't like your tone.
AID00131757	I just want to talk to Alice or Andy.
AID00131758	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
AID00131759	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
AID00131760	Goodbye.
AID00131761	Get lost!
AID00131762	I don't like your tone.
AID00131763	So what? I don't give a shit about what you like. Go cry to your mama.
AID00131764	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler and Andy.
AID00131765	Oh yeah? What for?
AID00131766	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
AID00131767	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
AID00131768	I just want to talk to Alice or Andy.
AID00131769	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
AID00131770	I'm looking for Andy or Alice so we could talk.
AID00131771	Actually, I still need to prepare some more.
AID00131772	I'm sure. Let's go.
AID00131773	I'm ready to fight Lupa.
AID00131774	You sure? Last chance to back out.
AID00131775	I'll be back when I'm ready.
AID00131776	Take all the time you need, otherwise Lupa will tear your throat out.
AID00131777	I'm ready to fight Lupa now.
AID00131778	All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
AID00131779	They have cyber-dogs in Denver?
AID00131780	Not too common but you still see 'em around.
AID00131781	Is that a yes?
AID00131782	You give Lupa a worthy death in the arena, and her brain is yours. Don't let your guard down just because she's old, though.
AID00131783	Oh, and standard arena rules still apply. You don't get to wear armor and you get only a machete for a weapon.
AID00131784	I could use Lupa's brain to fix my cyber-dog.
AID00131785	Cyber-dog? Like the ones I've seen up in Denver? I know what you're talking about, and it would make Lupa immortal in a way.
AID00131786	Start the quest to fix Rex's brain.
AID00131787	Done. Setting VMS24 to stage 10.
AID00131788	Never mind.
AID00131789	What else?
AID00131790	Spawn him and add him as a companion.
AID00131791	Done.
AID00131792	Never mind.
AID00131793	Very well.
AID00131794	Rex.
AID00131795	What do you want to do with Rex?
AID00131796	Companions.
AID00131797	Which companion?
AID00131798	You have an interesting name.
AID00131799	Thank you. I change names and jobs every decade or so, just to keep things interesting. I picked "Calamity" this time because it sounded nice.
AID00131800	I've never really done much science stuff until now. I'm pretty good at it, or so Doctor Henry tells me.
AID00131801	Does anyone other than Super Mutants come up this way?
AID00131802	Prospectors looking for salvage, usually. They always run when they see the mutants.
AID00131803	The Great Khans come this way once in awhile, but they keep their distance. I think they're mostly keeping an eye on us.
AID00131804	What do you do here?
AID00131805	Most of the time, I'm Doctor Henry's research assistant. We're looking into ways to cure the, uh... 
AID00131806	I'm also handy with tools, and once in awhile I venture down into the valley to trade Big Horner hides and meat for supplies.
AID00131807	Never mind. I want to hold off for now.
AID00131808	Hold off on the transplant.
AID00131809	All right. Your call.
AID00131810	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
AID00131811	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
AID00131812	I got a brain from Lupa, the mother of many Legion Mongrels.
AID00131813	Let's take a look... exceptional synapse responses... descended from some type of cattle dog, I imagine.
AID00131814	If you want me to transplant this brain into Rex, he'll become more durable.
AID00131815	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
AID00131816	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
AID00131817	This brain is from Rey, one of Old Lady Gibson's dogs.
AID00131818	All right, let's see here... neural pathways look good... definitely a breed of guard dog.
AID00131819	If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
AID00131820	Where did you want me to look for Alice?
AID00131821	Tell me again what you need done about your daughter.
AID00131822	Goodbye.
AID00131823	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131824	Crandon said you've got a problem. I take care of problems.
AID00131825	Tell me about this area of New Vegas.
AID00131826	Tell me about this area of New Vegas.
AID00131827	What's your take on the Legion and the NCR?
AID00131828	What's your take on the Legion and the NCR?
AID00131829	What's your take on the Legion and the NCR?
AID00131830	Don't get me started, stranger. We don't take kindly to either of them. We've fought hard for our home, and we're here to stay.
AID00131831	The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
AID00131832	The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
AID00131833	The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
AID00131834	The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
AID00131835	What did you say before about the Legion and the NCR?
AID00131836	Tell me about this area of New Vegas.
AID00131837	Folks call this East Vegas, but I don't care much for names.
AID00131838	The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
AID00131839	The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
AID00131840	Tell me again about East Vegas.
AID00131841	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00131842	Babysitting isn't my thing.
AID00131843	I'll check them out for you.
AID00131844	What do you need done about your daughter?
AID00131845	I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
AID00131846	I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
AID00131847	Where did you want me to look for Alice?
AID00131848	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
AID00131849	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
AID00131850	I took down a Fiend dog named Violetta.
AID00131851	Big brain on this one. All right, let's see... damn, heavy amounts of the chemicals used in the drug Turbo are present.
AID00131852	Transplanting this brain will make Rex faster than he was before.
AID00131853	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131854	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131855	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131856	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131857	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131858	Goodbye.
AID00131859	Another time, let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131860	Goodbye.
AID00131861	Another time, let's go back to my other questions.
AID00131862	I'm one with the land.
AID00131863	Goodbye.
AID00131864	Let me ask you something else.
AID00131865	I will. Tell me more about you.
AID00131866	Goodbye.
AID00131867	Thank you. Let me ask you something else.
AID00131868	Thanks, Jules. Tell me more about you.
AID00131869	I'm one with the land.
AID00131870	[SUCCEEDED] We see eye to eye, we speak warrior to warrior... And I thought myself too old to find an equal, Ha!
AID00131871	Listen, warrior. There're two kinds of folks. You load your gun like an ordinary man, or you load it like a devil.
AID00131872	We ain't ordinary, are we? See, I pack good brass up with slow-burning powder, then cap it with a heavy semiwadcutter bullet.
AID00131873	That's how you make .44 ammo that'll put the fear of the heavens on any waster that dare cross your path.
AID00131874	[FAILED] You don't get it yet, stranger. I'm not surprised, though. It takes a special type. Come back when you've got what it takes.
AID00131875	Of course I know who I am, who doesn't?
AID00131876	What do you mean by "more than just a weapon?"
AID00131877	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AID00131878	I mean you've first got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
AID00131879	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
AID00131880	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
AID00131881	I think I know what you meant before.
AID00131882	Goodbye.
AID00131883	I'll see you around.
AID00131884	Goodbye.
AID00131885	I mean you no harm. Crandon sent me.
AID00131886	<GENERAL QUESTIONS>
AID00131887	Alright. What do you want to know?
AID00131888	If you can find a way to cut off access to the sulfur in the caves below the vault, I've got some caps waiting for you.
AID00131889	Later.
AID00131890	See you around.
AID00131891	<GENERAL QUESTIONS>
AID00131892	What do you want to know?
AID00131893	There are some fire geckos in the lower levels of the Vault. We need to get them gone so we can get to the sulfur.
AID00131894	You go clear them out for us, and there'll be some caps for you.
AID00131895	I want you to head to Red Rock Canyon, north of here. Find Papa Khan and ask him if he'd allow the Powder gangers to join up.
AID00131896	Bye.
AID00131897	See you around.
AID00131898	How does the town support itself?
AID00131899	Bighorners. Good eating. And we can trade the hides. Got a lot of wild ones around here, so it's easy to restock the herd.
AID00131900	I'll help you out for a cut of the Hostetlers' money.
AID00131901	Alice should stay with her family.
AID00131902	Alice should know the truth.
AID00131903	Why would Alice follow your plans?
AID00131904	Goodbye.
AID00131905	That's right, and good riddance.
AID00131906	[Attack] Time to pay.
AID00131907	I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131908	Relax, I was just leaving.
AID00131909	We'll see. Goodbye.
AID00131910	<Attack> Like this: You're dead.
AID00131911	Goodbye.
AID00131912	<Attack> I'm looking for you. It's time to die.
AID00131913	I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131914	Goodbye.
AID00131915	<Attack> Only after I've taken care of you.
AID00131916	Actually, I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131917	Maybe I'll do that, then. Goodbye.
AID00131918	A cut from the Hostetlers' money, and I might help you.
AID00131919	I'm glad we understand each other. Alice's at her home, getting our means out of this shit-hole. Make sure things go smoothly.
AID00131920	Goodbye.
AID00131921	Yeah, sure.
AID00131922	<Attack> Sure, but first, let's tie up loose ends.
AID00131923	Aren't you afraid I'll blow your plans?
AID00131924	And how exactly would you do that?
AID00131925	Goodbye.
AID00131926	It's not polite to leave in the middle of a conversation, but I won't try to teach you manners. This time.
AID00131927	You're manipulating her into betraying her family.
AID00131928	Family's just what the world throws on our shoulders without our say or opinion.
AID00131929	You think Alice cares about her family? Tell her, then. Family's what drove her to me in the first place.
AID00131930	She deserves to know the truth.
AID00131931	And... you think that's worth her happiness? Go on and tell her, then. Watch what happens when you crush her dreams.
AID00131932	Nothing, goodbye.
AID00131933	Leaving so soon? And I thought we'd have time for a little chat.
AID00131934	<Attack> And it's the last you'll ever see.
AID00131935	Oh boy, you've just made your last mistake.
AID00131936	I went into your room. I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131937	I was just exploring North Vegas and found this building.
AID00131938	Goodbye.
AID00131939	<Attack> She won't be, once I'm done with you.
AID00131940	Why would she be?
AID00131941	Maybe because I'm so good-looking.
AID00131942	Maybe because her mother's trying to break her back planting crops that die from rads as soon as they're in the ground.
AID00131943	Or maybe she's just a dupe. Why do you even care? She's happy making her own way in the world.
AID00131944	Goodbye.
AID00131945	<Attack> Yes, but I figured I'd save her the trouble of killing you.
AID00131946	Yes, I did. I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131947	You think I give a shit? Has it crossed your mind that Alice is all the way in this with me?
AID00131948	<Lie> I've no idea what you're talking about.
AID00131949	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... I've got my eye on you. Get the fuck off my turf.
AID00131950	[FAILED] Please, I've seen kids who were better liars than you. Tell the truth now - what are you after?
AID00131951	Goodbye.
AID00131952	<Attack> I'm here to kill you.
AID00131953	Nobody threatens me and walks away alive!
AID00131954	I know about your plans for Alice.
AID00131955	Relax, I was just leaving.
AID00131956	Wait right there. You told my men that Alice's mother was waiting for me outside, didn't you?
AID00131957	Wait right there. I don't recall seeing your pretty face before - what do you want?
AID00131958	Anything you can help me with?
AID00131959	Well I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
AID00131960	I'm all set. When does the President arrive?
AID00131961	Good timing. Looks like his Vertibird is arriving early. Here it comes now.
AID00131962	I hope you're up for this, because we won't get a second chance.
AID00131963	<Cato Good Morning Dialog>
AID00131964	Rise and shine. You have a big day ahead of you.
AID00131965	So, do you have a plan for how you're going to kill Kimball?
AID00131966	Actually, just sort this out on your own.
AID00131967	Forget it. Sort your problems by yourselves.
AID00131968	Forget it. Sort your problems by yourselves.
AID00131969	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
AID00131970	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
AID00131971	Oh, you think I won't do it? I'll show you!
AID00131972	<Attack> No, you won't.
AID00131973	Is that what you really want?
AID00131974	Look at this note I found in Andy's room.
AID00131975	Don't worry. Just get the cash. I'll wait for you.
AID00131976	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00131977	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00131978	Do you have the money?
AID00131979	Do you have the money?
AID00131980	I know, but look at this note I've found in Andy's room.
AID00131981	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00131982	[Attack] That won't do. Time to put you down.
AID00131983	What's going on in here?
AID00131984	Do you have the money?
AID00131985	<Attack> I think I'll just put you down.
AID00131986	What's going on in here?
AID00131987	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00131988	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00131989	They care for you, in their own way.
AID00131990	<Attack> You're right, there's no turning back. Time to teach you a lesson.
AID00131991	Talk you out of what?
AID00131992	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00131993	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00131994	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
AID00131995	Yeah, okay... I'll shoot the lock off the door and... and then.... Argh, dammit!
AID00131996	... I can't do it, I can't. She deserves it, and worse, but I can't hurt my own mother!
AID00131997	Never mind, Andy sent me to help you, actually.
AID00131998	<Attack> I'll help you leave, dead cold.
AID00131999	What's going on here?
AID00132000	Do you have the money?
AID00132001	They care for you, in their own way.
AID00132002	Do they? Look at my Mother, all she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
AID00132003	My Father? A trading business that he'll never own, risking his neck every day against Wastelanders and cut-throat "merchants."
AID00132004	And I'm supposed to be part of those dreams? What about my dreams, stranger? What about me?
AID00132005	What do you really want, Alice?
AID00132006	[SUCCEEDED] I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
AID00132007	It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
AID00132008	[SUCCEEDED] I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
AID00132009	It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
AID00132010	[FAILED] The money, yes! It's mine, and nobody can stop me from getting it!
AID00132011	Why are you doing this? Just for the money?
AID00132012	No, look at this note I found in his room.
AID00132013	... That- that- that son of a bitch! I'll take the money and I'll kill him too!
AID00132014	<Attack> I'll take over now, without you.
AID00132015	What's going on here?
AID00132016	Do you have the money?
AID00132017	She's guarding it, I know she is!
AID00132018	She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
AID00132019	She's guarding it, I know she is!
AID00132020	She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
AID00132021	So, where's the money?
AID00132022	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00132023	Wh-What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
AID00132024	<Attack> Time to put you down!
AID00132025	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00132026	I hear you, and I'm not going to hurt you.
AID00132027	<Attack> Time to put you down!
AID00132028	What's going on in here?
AID00132029	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00132030	I just want to talk, that's all.
AID00132031	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, but this better not be a trick!
AID00132032	[FAILED] I'm not stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
AID00132033	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
AID00132034	Dammit, I can take care of this by myself! That bitch is going to pay for all these years of bossing me around.
AID00132035	<Attack> Time to put you down!
AID00132036	You too? Think I'm just a little girl? I'll show you!
AID00132037	What's going on here?
AID00132038	It's payback time, that's what! They've got no right to screw me over, and I'm tired of it!
AID00132039	I'm not here to hurt you.
AID00132040	Then what the hell do you want? Don't try anything, I mean it!
AID00132041	<Attack> I'll make you do it.
AID00132042	I should've known you don't have what it takes.
AID00132043	Oh, you think I won't do it? You think I'm not right in wanting back my life!? I'll show you!
AID00132044	Give me your gun, Alice.
AID00132045	Fine. Take it. But what the hell am I supposed to do now?
AID00132046	<Attack> You are no help, time to put you down.
AID00132047	I'm not interested in this. Sort it out yourselves.
AID00132048	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
AID00132049	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
AID00132050	What are you talking about?
AID00132051	You must be the backup I've been calling for. Where are the rest of your men?
AID00132052	I heard your radio broadcast. I'm here to help.
AID00132053	Thank God. I hoped someone would come eventually, but where are the rest of your men?
AID00132054	This is it, buddy.
AID00132055	Shit. Have you any damn idea what lives in these caves!? We need to get out of...
AID00132056	We need to go now!
AID00132057	You think I need more men to get the job done?
AID00132058	What killed the other troopers?
AID00132059	I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
AID00132060	I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
AID00132061	Are you okay?
AID00132062	I managed to kill that thing, but not before it mangled my leg all up. No way I'm walking out of here like this.
AID00132063	I've been keeping quiet and hoping they don't realize one of their buddies is missing. We need to get out of here before they come back.
AID00132064	How did you kill that thing?
AID00132065	With my bare hands. I would have shot it, but I was cleaning my gun when they swarmed the camp.
AID00132066	The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into it's back.
AID00132067	Once he was on the ground, all it took was a bit of choking and punching to finish him off.
AID00132068	
AID00132069	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
AID00132070	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
AID00132071	Looks like some nasty lacerations and a dislocated joint. You're lucky I found you.
AID00132072	[FAILED] Whoa there, buddy. What you're suggesting is downright archaic.
AID00132073	I think my tourniquet will work for now, but I still can't walk like this.
AID00132074	If I had a doctor's bag, I could probaly fix it up myself.
AID00132075	I think I've got a dull needle and twine in one of my pockets.
AID00132076	<Use Doctor Bag to heal his leg> This should help fix up your leg.
AID00132077	Thanks a lot, doc. Looks like I should be able to at least walk out of here, now.
AID00132078	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
AID00132079	I'll be back.
AID00132080	Great, just leave me here, then.
AID00132081	That's a nice gun you've got there.
AID00132082	You can have it if you get me out of here alive. I won't have a use for it when I get back to California.
AID00132083	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
AID00132084	Great, I'll start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
AID00132085	If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
AID00132086	If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
AID00132087	We need to clear the caves first.
AID00132088	Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into these caves.
AID00132089	You haven't seen what they did to the other troopers, and I'd rather not find out why they took all of the bodies.
AID00132090	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
AID00132091	
AID00132092	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you have a point. They were good men and deserved better.
AID00132093	I can't guarantee I'll be much help against their numbers, but I'll do what I can. Chances are we won't get out of here alive anyway.
AID00132094	If we don't clear the caves, your friends' deaths were for nothing. Can you live with that?
AID00132095	[FAILED] Hey, I'm all for being a hero when the time is right, but there are at least 12 of those bastards lurking around in here.
AID00132096	I'd rather not join my buddies any time soon.
AID00132097	More people are going to die if we don't do something.
AID00132098	Let's get moving.
AID00132099	Lead on.
AID00132100	Have a safe trip.
AID00132101	Nobody who threatens me lives to tell about it. Not even Nightkin.
AID00132102	DoctorHenryToLily04
AID00132103	I'll get back to you on that in a moment. Once I've analyzed the results - uh, oh.
AID00132104	LilyToDoctorHenry03
AID00132105	Awww... I liked having it on.
AID00132106	LilyToDoctorHenry02
AID00132107	Grrr! Lily smash! Haha.
AID00132108	LilyToDoctorHenry01
AID00132109	Turning it on. Urgh... feels strange. Strange but good.
AID00132110	DoctorHenryToLily03
AID00132111	All right, we're done here. Go ahead and power the Stealth Boy down, Lily.
AID00132112	DoctorHenryToLily02
AID00132113	Interesting. Try thinking aggressive thoughts now. Think about smashing a Radscorpion.
AID00132114	DoctorHenryToLily01
AID00132115	All right, power on the Stealth Boy, Lily.
AID00132116	Don't start just yet. I'll be back.
AID00132117	Oh, all right.
AID00132118	Go ahead and start the tests.
AID00132119	Very well. Please stand back - I don't want any erroneous readings. You're welcome to stay and observe if you want, though.
AID00132120	Wait, Lily's not in position yet. Talk to me again once she's settled in.
AID00132121	Goodbye.
AID00132122	Bye.
AID00132123	I'm looking into the Nightstalker mutation. Want to come along with me?
AID00132124	Oooh, those Nightstalkers, always killing my Bighorners! It'll be nice to give them a piece of my mind!
AID00132125	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
AID00132126	About Doctor Henry's experiment...
AID00132127	What makes you think that the Nightstalker mutation isn't natural?
AID00132128	I've compared the brain chemistry of a Nightkin to one of the local Nightstalkers we killed. They both exhibit similar neurochemical changes.
AID00132129	Now, I'm not claiming that Nightstalkers are running around wearing Stealth Boys, mind you. I just don't think it's all a coincidence.
AID00132130	I'm not ready yet.
AID00132131	Well hurry it up and get your shit together.
AID00132132	Yes, I'm ready.
AID00132133	Good. Now Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk over the plan first thing in the morning.
AID00132134	Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
AID00132135	I've made my preparations. Let's get started.
AID00132136	Good. Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk the plan over first thing in the morning.
AID00132137	Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
AID00132138	Let's get on with this.
AID00132139	Right, straight to business. Good. No wonder Caesar sent you.
AID00132140	Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
AID00132141	Nice to meet you too.
AID00132142	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. I've heard about you. You've got quite the reputation already.
AID00132143	Well let's get down to business. Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
AID00132144	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. Can't say I'm impressed, but let's just get down to business.
AID00132145	Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
AID00132146	I don't care about any of this.
AID00132147	[Attack] I think you're better dead.
AID00132148	Grab the money and run far away.
AID00132149	You think I really care about the money? I just... no, no, no!
AID00132150	Once I have my share, you can get out of here.
AID00132151	I don't want to get out, do you hear me! I just... no, no, no!
AID00132152	[Attack] You're next!
AID00132153	That was great! Good job, Alice.
AID00132154	Are you out of your mind? I just... no, no, no!
AID00132155	Now there really is no turning back.
AID00132156	Father... what's he going to do to me? I can't stay here, I can't hide from this!
AID00132157	I give up. Sort it out on your own.
AID00132158	Calm down. I just want to talk.
AID00132159	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
AID00132160	<Attack> That won't do. Time to put you down.
AID00132161	So, where's the money?
AID00132162	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AID00132163	<Attack> You're not going anywhere.
AID00132164	You should get out of here and never come back.
AID00132165	You should stay with your family - reconcile with them.
AID00132166	Give them a chance.
AID00132167	<Attack> Here's my answer.
AID00132168	You should leave and never come back.
AID00132169	Only you can answer that.
AID00132170	[SUCCEEDED]... It's all me, isn't it? The pain, the anger, my joy, all of that's just me.
AID00132171	I should've met you before, stranger. Thank you.
AID00132172	[FAILED] Some choice. I can't stay here now, and I don't have the means to leave.
AID00132173	I... guess that's your choice.
AID00132174	<Attack> I'm not seeing it either, yet!
AID00132175	[Attack] I'm not seeing it either, yet!
AID00132176	You should leave and never come back.
AID00132177	You should leave and never come back.
AID00132178	[Attack] Thanks for the gun, it will make this easier.
AID00132179	You should get out of here and never come back.
AID00132180	You're right, there's no place for me here. Just... just tell them I'm sorry, and that they won't have to worry about me, ever again.
AID00132181	You should stay with your family - reconcile with them.
AID00132182	Maybe you're right... but what will they think? How can I look them in the face ever again?
AID00132183	Well, I guess I don't deserve any better, huh? So be it...
AID00132184	Doctor Henry, do as he asks.
AID00132185	You're not getting the Mark II specs.
AID00132186	[Stare silently at him.]
AID00132187	Bah! Humans.
AID00132188	How does that make you different from some humans?
AID00132189	It is different! Right now I'm trying very hard to remain civil, and you're not making it easy with your incessant questions!
AID00132190	Do you have a problem with humans?
AID00132191	Humans are always staring at things. We Nightkin don't like being stared at. Is is... uncomfortable.
AID00132192	Goodbye.
AID00132193	NightkinToDoctorHenry
AID00132194	Well, well. Congratulations on getting the Mark II prototype functional, doctor. Now just hand it over and we'll be on our way.
AID00132195	What do you do in Jacobstown?
AID00132196	I watch over the Bighorners. They're sweet, gentle creatures, but sometimes they get ornery. Just like my grandkids!
AID00132197	I've been a lot of help to you already. You can do me this one favor.
AID00132198	You have been a useful associate, that I'll grant you. Okay, he's yours for a discount. Just make sure the stage is downwind of the audience.
AID00132199	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132200	Can do.
AID00132201	What kind of crops do you grow?
AID00132202	Everything I can. Farmers out here don't have the luxury of being picky. I get by mostly on maize and tobacco.
AID00132203	What are NCR troopers doing here?
AID00132204	They're part of the deal, the Thaler Act. We work the fields while they protect the crops and the water.
AID00132205	Lotta folks come to New Vegas and lose everything in Freeside or the Strip. They get hungry, desperate, and try to take our hard work.
AID00132206	Much as I sympathize, their theft would put me in a bad spot. I got a crop quota to meet.
AID00132207	Why is this work a bum deal?
AID00132208	Bad soil and rationed water. It's to be expected around here, but the rationing's off. Worst part is NCR won't admit it.
AID00132209	Pretty hard to meet their crop quotas with twenty percent less water than we're supposed to be getting. Not that OSI cares about any of this.
AID00132210	What's the Thaler Act?
AID00132211	Something the politicians back in Shady Sands came up with. They pay us to move here and farm the land. They even protect the fields.
AID00132212	You work these fields?
AID00132213	Sure do. Came from The Hub on account of the Thaler Act. Farming's decent work, but the whole thing's a bum deal.
AID00132214	Goodbye.
AID00132215	Adios.
AID00132216	Trent Bascom says he's not getting his full allotment of water.
AID00132217	The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
AID00132218	Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
AID00132219	If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
AID00132220	What can you tell me about these fields?
AID00132221	Impressive, aren't they? You don't see anything like this outside of NCR territory, that's for sure.
AID00132222	We get the water - clean water - pumped in from Lake Mead. If you follow the big pipes, they'll take you all the way to the Lake.
AID00132223	Why are these fields being guarded?
AID00132224	A lot of the crops grown here support the various NCR camps in the region - McCarran, Golf, and Forlorn Hope, to name a few.
AID00132225	We can't have wastelanders popping in here for a free meal, so my squad and I are assigned to keep things from going to hell.
AID00132226	Goodbye.
AID00132227	Carry on.
AID00132228	What happens if Keene leaves?
AID00132229	That happens, there's a good chance other Nightkin will follow. It'll make it hard to get a cure to them.
AID00132230	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are going get killed.
AID00132231	Most humans can't tell the difference between mutants. Might come here looking for payback.
AID00132232	Why does Keene want to leave?
AID00132233	Because of a promise. One I haven't been able to keep. The Nightkin all suffer from schizophrenia. It's the Stealth Boys they use, used to use.
AID00132234	Nightkin have a hard time being seen like normal folks. Can't stand it. A few already left to try and find more Stealth Boys.
AID00132235	Miserable situation. They either stay here and suffer, or dig up Stealth Boys and lose their minds. Not much of a choice.
AID00132236	What's the story with Keene?
AID00132237	I'm looking for Corporal White. I was told that he'd spoken to you.
AID00132238	Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
AID00132239	White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
AID00132240	The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
AID00132241	Can't you just grow less crops?
AID00132242	I wouldn't be able to meet the quota, and the NCR would kick me out of my job, anyway. Nah, it's better I get out on my own terms.
AID00132243	Goodbye.
AID00132244	Good luck to you out here.
AID00132245	What are you going to do now?
AID00132246	I hear the Brahmin ranchers out in Redding are looking for some hard workers, so I might try there first. I hate working with Brahmin, though.
AID00132247	Me? I have no idea what you're talking about.
AID00132248	Sure you don't. All just a happy coincidence, am I right?
AID00132249	<Lie> The NCR admitted there's bad pipes somewhere, and took care of the problem.
AID00132250	That's what I figured. Don't know why the heck they're so stubborn they couldn't just admit it.
AID00132251	Water was being diverted to Westside, but I took care of the problem.
AID00132252	Westside, huh? I hope the NCR does something about those thieving bastards. I appreciate it, and so do the rest of the farmers.
AID00132253	Maybe you don't want for food much, but you can sell these on the market for a good price. Like I said, we're much obliged for the help.
AID00132254	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132255	Yes, please do.
AID00132256	Do you have something against White?
AID00132257	He's a glory hound, always looking for a way to get promoted to Ranger. Thinks he's too good to be a regular trooper like the rest of us.
AID00132258	You haven't heard anything more from White?
AID00132259	Haven't seen him. Serves him right if the NCR declares him AWOL.
AID00132260	I'm looking for Corporal White. Trent told me you'd seen him.
AID00132261	Corporal White is currently solving the mystery of the Great Water Shortage. Tried to convince me he had proof, even. I didn't buy any of it.
AID00132262	He went over to Westside to talk to Tom Anderson. Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse. Helps the people in Westside grow crops or something.
AID00132263	I got a Deathclaw egg for you.
AID00132264	I just happen to have a Deathclaw egg with me. Here.
AID00132265	I can't believe you actually got one. Give me a bit to get the recipe set up, then talk to me again.
AID00132266	Any trouble around here?
AID00132267	Well, there's the Deathclaws, of course, and there was that one group of Powder Gangers who stole all the dynamite.
AID00132268	I think we're too small and poor for anyone to bother with, really. I keep a weapon near my bunk, though - same as everybody here.
AID00132269	Are you from California?
AID00132270	Born and raised. Things back in California are better than they've ever been, according to my grandpa.
AID00132271	The Raiders are mostly gone now and it's easy enough to get a job at one of the mills or farms. But now there's taxes and laws and other things.
AID00132272	The NCR keeps things safe and orderly, but it's all very boring. So, I came out east towards the frontier.
AID00132273	You don't look like a quarry worker.
AID00132274	Oh, I'm not. I'm making my way to New Vegas. They say anything goes there, and best of all, the NCR can't mess it up for you.
AID00132275	I'll get there eventually. I've heard that you can't even get into the Strip unless you're rich.
AID00132276	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132277	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00132278	Sure thing.
AID00132279	I had some questions about this place.
AID00132280	Sure. What did you want to know?
AID00132281	About that Deathclaw Omelet recipe...
AID00132282	Yeah?
AID00132283	Goodbye.
AID00132284	All right, then!
AID00132285	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132286	All right. Do you need anything to eat or drink?
AID00132287	What are you offering in exchange for a Deathclaw egg?
AID00132288	I don't have much in the way of money, but I'd be willing to share the secret of the recipe.
AID00132289	Where can I find a Deathclaw egg?
AID00132290	The quarry just north of here is full of Deathclaws, so there's bound to be an egg or two in there somewhere.
AID00132291	Of course, a Deathclaw egg from anywhere will do. According to my Aunt Rose, those things have a ridiculously long shelf life.
AID00132292	Where did you come up with this recipe?
AID00132293	My great-aunt Rose ran a bed and breakfast back in California, in a town called Modoc. She's the one who created the recipe in the first place.
AID00132294	I don't know how she managed to get a hold of a female Deathclaw, but she kept it in a shed. Aunt Rose had a steady supply of eggs for her omelets.
AID00132295	At least, she did until some stranger came along and killed the Deathclaw. Shot it right in the eye.
AID00132296	Anything that wasn't made 200 years ago.
AID00132297	Ha. Yeah, can you believe some people still eat that stuff? Anyway...
AID00132298	Ghouls and Super Mutants sometimes taste like Brahmin steaks.
AID00132299	You're just pulling my leg, right? Why would anyone... uh... never mind. Anyway...
AID00132300	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
AID00132301	Why do you ask?
AID00132302	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
AID00132303	People have a rather unique taste, I've discovered.
AID00132304	Uh... hmm... well, no accounting for taste I guess. Anyway...
AID00132305	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
AID00132306	I killed the Deathclaw Mother and the Deathclaw Alpha Male.
AID00132307	Coming from anyone else, I'd say they were drunk or crazy, but that look in your eyes - I believe you.
AID00132308	I can pay you, but it ain't much for what you pulled off. I'll get on the ham radio first thing and tell people all about you, though.
AID00132309	I killed the Deathclaw Alpha Male.
AID00132310	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take him out.
AID00132311	I hate to say it, but as long as the Deathclaw Mother is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere. She'll take another mate and keep laying eggs.
AID00132312	I killed the Mother Deathclaw.
AID00132313	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take her out.
AID00132314	I hate to say it, but as long as the Alpha Male is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere, even with the Deathclaw Mother out of the picture.
AID00132315	I fixed Snuffles' leg.
AID00132316	I'd noticed Snuffles limping, but I didn't realize the problem was that serious. Thanks - that beast helps keep spirits up around here.
AID00132317	I repaired your generator.
AID00132318	It's nice to see things going the way they're supposed to, for a change. I'm going to pay you out of my own pocket for this one.
AID00132319	I noticed you have a tame molerat.
AID00132320	Yeah, he - or she, I guess - wandered into camp a couple of months back. Seemed friendly enough.
AID00132321	Ugly-looking thing, but the guys like having it around. Good for morale and all that.
AID00132322	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132323	Sure.
AID00132324	You don't get paid in caps?
AID00132325	Nope. The NCR's been trying to switch over to using paper money, like in the Pre-War days. Trouble is that the exchange rates ain't exactly fair.
AID00132326	For example, a hundred bucks in NCR money is valued at roughly half that in caps around here. Seems like a rotten deal for us, but work is work.
AID00132327	What's a dragline?
AID00132328	It's a big machine which moves rocks around, piles at a time. It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in awhile to keep it running.
AID00132329	What does the NCR need with the cement?
AID00132330	It all gets shipped by rail over towards Boulder City and Hoover Dam. The NCR's probably building fortifications with it all.
AID00132331	What is this place?
AID00132332	This is Sloan, a camp for us quarry workers. The actual quarry, Quarry Junction, is up the road north of here. The whole thing is an NCR operation.
AID00132333	We make cement for the NCR using the limestone we dig out with dynamite and draglines. Dirty work, but the pay's good.
AID00132334	Wish we got paid in caps, though. Not a lot of merchants like taking NCR paper money.
AID00132335	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132336	Okay.
AID00132337	I could take care of your Deathclaw problem.
AID00132338	Have you even seen a Deathclaw? They're taller than a man and far, far stronger and faster. And, there's a whole pack of them out there.
AID00132339	You'd have to be the meanest, toughest, roughest bastard in the wasteland to have any chance against them, and I don't think that's you.
AID00132340	You'd need to take out the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Kill 'em, and the pack will scatter. Pretty tough job.
AID00132341	I don't what it is about you, but I think you could actually pull it off. Deathclaws are tough bastards, but you might be even tougher.
AID00132342	Nobody here's any use to you in a fight against Deathclaws, but take these medical supplies. You'll probably need them.
AID00132343	To do the job right, you've got to get rid of the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Should run the rest of 'em off.
AID00132344	Have you had problems with Deathclaws before?
AID00132345	We'd see them occasionally, but they didn't seem too keen on getting too close to the quarry. Not sure if it was the noise or all the workers.
AID00132346	I can't believe that an entire pack moved into the quarry. I thought that kind of bad luck only happened in New Vegas.
AID00132347	Tell me about the Powder Gangers.
AID00132348	They're a bunch of escaped cons from down south. The NCR was using them to maintain the railways as part of their sentence.
AID00132349	I don't know who screwed up, but the Powder Gangers are loose. It was one group that attacked us and took our entire supply of dynamite.
AID00132350	Where'd the Deathclaws come from?
AID00132351	They moved into the quarry after the Powder Gangers came through and made off with most of our dynamite.
AID00132352	We shut the quarry down while we waited for the NCR to get us some more blasting sticks, but now the Deathclaws have shown up.
AID00132353	The NCR's a no-show, and my men and I have got nothing to do but sit on our asses all day. It's damn frustrating.
AID00132354	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
AID00132355	I've been there once, and I don't recommend it. It's just a way to burn through a month's pay in five minutes.
AID00132356	I've seen a lot of folks come through here thinking they'll have the easy life once they get there. It never happens.
AID00132357	Goodbye.
AID00132358	If you insist on going north, don't be expecting a rescue when you get into trouble.
AID00132359	Yep.
AID00132360	I don't need a bomb.
AID00132361	Suit yourself.
AID00132362	How hard can it be to put a bomb on a vertibird?
AID00132363	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing this, so I'll just hold on to this.
AID00132364	I'm familiar with explosives, give it here.
AID00132365	Here you go. Put it to good use.
AID00132366	No thanks.
AID00132367	Suit yourself. What else do you want to know?
AID00132368	How hard can it be to put a bomb on a vertibird?
AID00132369	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing us both up, so I'll just hold on to this.
AID00132370	I'm familiar with explosives, give it here.
AID00132371	Here you go. Put it to good use.
AID00132372	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00132373	Okay, what would you like to know?
AID00132374	Give me the security details.
AID00132375	Security is going to be tight. Rangers are stationed all around the observation deck where Kimball is going to give his speech.
AID00132376	Security is led by a Ranger Grant. He's a pretty rough guy who's seen a lot of combat. It's best if you steer clear of him.
AID00132377	The crowd consists of troopers and a few select civilians who were lucky enough to bribe their way in. They shouldn't cause much trouble for you.
AID00132378	Finally, there's the additional security that Kimball will be bringing with him. I wasn't able to find out much on that.
AID00132379	If I had more time in their computers I could've accessed the full duty roster and guard deployment. Maybe you'll have better luck.
AID00132380	Tell me about Kimball's schedule.
AID00132381	The President is scheduled to arrive sometime in the afternoon. It's going to be a short visit to boost morale for the NCR troops.
AID00132382	He's going to arrive, give a speech, and then leave. No meet and greet, no questions, just a quick in and out.
AID00132383	They're probably afraid something is going to happen. For good reason.
AID00132384	I wasn't able to find a final itinerary for his visit, but if you can find one, you can get more details on what's going to happen.
AID00132385	I don't have any more questions.
AID00132386	If there's nothing else, then we should get moving.
AID00132387	Is there anything you can do to help?
AID00132388	Well, I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
AID00132389	How are we getting into the Dam?
AID00132390	I have some disguises for us. I've already got mine. A wealthy Brahmin Baron who bribed his way into seeing the President.
AID00132391	As for you, I have a NCR trooper uniform that I acquired. It'll fool most of the troopers and civilians, but it probably won't fool the rangers.
AID00132392	What sort of intel have you gathered?
AID00132393	I've been able to get some basic information on the schedule for Kimball's visit as well as getting some rough security details.
AID00132394	Do you have any suggestions about the assassination?
AID00132395	Suggestions, eh? I'd suggest you play to your strengths. There's probably plenty of ways to kill Kimball, just find one that works best for you.
AID00132396	We'll have a few hours before he arrives. You should look around and see if you can find anything that you can use.
AID00132397	Just be careful. You don't want to cause a scene before Kimball even shows up.
AID00132398	Let's get moving.
AID00132399	You're the boss.
AID00132400	I'll be in the crowd. Do whatever you need to do, then find me before Kimball arrives.
AID00132401	Here's your disguise. This'll get you past most of the NCR there, but watch out for the rangers. Odds are this won't fool them.
AID00132402	I'll meet you there. Good luck.
AID00132403	What sort of information do you have?
AID00132404	I've been spying in the dam for a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
AID00132405	It's none of your business.
AID00132406	Fine, be like that. I'm just here to give you whatever information I can to help you get the job done.
AID00132407	If you don't need my help, that's fine with me.
AID00132408	I don't need a plan to put a bullet in his head.
AID00132409	True, but I don't think it'll be that easy.
AID00132410	Going in guns blazing with all the NCR Troopers and Rangers stationed at the dam will just get you killed.
AID00132411	I do have some information that you might find useful, if you're interested.
AID00132412	I haven't given it much thought.
AID00132413	You better start thinking about it soon, we're on a limited time schedule.
AID00132414	I do have some information that could help you.
AID00132415	Of course I have a plan.
AID00132416	Prepared already. I like it. There's no need to give me the details, it's probably best that way.
AID00132417	Even though you already have a plan, I may have some information that you might find useful.
AID00132418	No reason. Sorry to bother you.
AID00132419	Uh, sure. I'll just be going then.
AID00132420	Hand over the necklace, thief.
AID00132421	Fat chance of that. What are you going to do if don't?
AID00132422	Kill you, I suppose.
AID00132423	I'm going to see that justice is done.
AID00132424	Not if I kill you first!
AID00132425	Nothing, I guess.
AID00132426	You are such a wimp! Die!
AID00132427	Let's just say I'll leave just enough of you left for the dogs to fight over.
AID00132428	H-here. You can have the damn necklace. Just leave me alone!
AID00132429	You stole that cap necklace from that poor man.
AID00132430	So what if I did? What are you going to do about it?
AID00132431	Actually, the necklace is made of seven caps. It's not really yours, is it?
AID00132432	Well, I guess you're just too smart for me. Unfortunately, I can't leave any witnesses behind.
AID00132433	
AID00132434	They are nice, aren't they? I'm very proud of them.
AID00132435	Nothing like those six you've got there.
AID00132436	Pretty sure, yeah. it's really nice, isn't it? Have you ever seen caps with pretty blue stars on them like these?
AID00132437	Are you sure that necklace is yours?
AID00132438	Sure have. And I'm thinking of adding yours to my collection.
AID00132439	You know, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
AID00132440	No, can't say that I have.
AID00132441	That's too bad. They're very rare. Well, I should be going. Nice talking to you.
AID00132442	Yes, I've got a few myself.
AID00132443	Ah, then you know how rare they are. I'm just glad they're back where they belong. You can never be too careful these days.
AID00132444	Well, it was nice to meet you. I'm going to take a few moments to get myself together, then head out.
AID00132445	What was that you took from his corpse?
AID00132446	What? This? He stole this from me at gunpoint. Lucky for me, he got distracted and I got a chance to draw on him.
AID00132447	It's a, uh, necklace that I made out of these special caps. You ever see any caps with a blue star on them like these?
AID00132448	Don't mention it. I'll be on my way.
AID00132449	Stay safe. The road's dangerous in these parts. Or so I hear.
AID00132450	Figure it out yourself. I need to get out of here.
AID00132451	Just be more careful in the future, okay?
AID00132452	I will. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
AID00132453	Just get rid of them. It doesn't matter how you do it.
AID00132454	You got it. I'm glad I ran into you. Thanks for the advice.
AID00132455	I can hold onto them for you. I'm not worried about the people that are looking for them.
AID00132456	They're all yours. I sincerely hope they work better for you than they did for me.
AID00132457	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over or I gut you like a fish.
AID00132458	Uh, yeah, sure. H-here you go. Just don't hurt me.
AID00132459	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over.
AID00132460	What? The hell I will!
AID00132461	
AID00132462	[SUCCEEDED] Really? I had no idea. And here I've been carrying them all this time, never knowing how dangerous they were.
AID00132463	What do you think I should do with them? Bury 'em or something?
AID00132464	All sorts of nasty people are looking for caps like those. You'd be safer if you got rid of them.
AID00132465	[FAILED] Even if what you're saying is true, I think I'll take my chances. This necklace and I have been through a lot, and we're both still kicking.
AID00132466	If that's not lucky, what is?
AID00132467	Those caps are bad luck. Why don't you let me hold onto them for you?
AID00132468	I have to be going.
AID00132469	Lucky charm necklace?
AID00132470	Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
AID00132471	Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
AID00132472	And maybe they are, since you managed to show up at just the right time.
AID00132473	Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
AID00132474	Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
AID00132475	Did you know her?
AID00132476	Not for long. I met her on the road a few days ago, and we've been traveling together since.
AID00132477	Surrender, general. The dam is almost taken.
AID00132478	This battle is far from over. Once the reinforcements from McCarran arrive, the counteroffensive will begin.
AID00132479	VHDOliverLegionFightStarter
AID00132480	So, you must be the Courier the reports mentioned. Pass this message on to your commander - Hoover Dam will not fall while I still draw breath.
AID00132481	How do you like being part of the NCR military?
AID00132482	It's better than farming or herding Brahmin. As long as they don't send me to the front lines, I'm a happy man.
AID00132483	About those chemical supplies...
AID00132484	Still got 'em. You ready to pay up?
AID00132485	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00132486	Whatever. You know where to find me.
AID00132487	Here's 300 caps. Hand over those supplies.
AID00132488	Pleasure doing business with you. Of course, this whole deal never happened, am I right?
AID00132489	< Barter 35 >
AID00132490	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, I'll just eat the cost and do a favor for Chomps. Just this one time only.
AID00132491	Is 300 caps worth being known as a deal-breaker? Seems like bad business to me.
AID00132492	[FAILED] Hey, that's just business.
AID00132493	It's not a fair trade, and you know it.
AID00132494	< Speech 40 >
AID00132495	[SUCCEEDED] I've reconsidered my position, and I think it would be in my best interest if I were to sacrifice my profit on this particular deal.
AID00132496	I say the word and someone else will start making deliveries to Nevada, not you.
AID00132497	[FAILED] I'd love to help you and Chomps, but I got my own expenses to worry about.
AID00132498	Come on. Give me a break, just this once.
AID00132499	You were already paid in advance.
AID00132500	Yeah, and as it turns out, the advance wasn't enough. The price has gone up. That's just how it goes.
AID00132501	A friend in Sloan told me to come to you about some chemical supplies.
AID00132502	You trying to get me busted? Keep your damn voice down - Lieutenant Hayes already has his eye on me.
AID00132503	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
AID00132504	Keep your damn voice down. Even though Lieutenant Hayes got himself killed recently, somebody else might be watching me.
AID00132505	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
AID00132506	What do you do here?
AID00132507	Just making some deliveries to the troops here in Primm. I'm stationed in California, but I come across the border a couple times a month.
AID00132508	Goodbye.
AID00132509	Later.
AID00132510	How do you know Melissa?
AID00132511	She's my daughter. Takes a little too much after her mother, rest her soul, but she's happy with the Great Khans, and that's enough for me.
AID00132512	All right. I'll go pay a visit to Tyrone.
AID00132513	Good luck.
AID00132514	Has Tyrone cheated you before?
AID00132515	He's always been shady, but this is the first time he's outright screwed me.
AID00132516	You don't care that you're helping the Great Khans?
AID00132517	I'm just the middle man. The Great Khans are a hard group, and some of them are no good, but they're not all the same.
AID00132518	I believe in the NCR, but that doesn't make it right for them to roll over anyone who doesn't want any part of 'em.
AID00132519	I'm looking for a suitcase filled with chemical supplies for a... friend. Know anything?
AID00132520	Ah, yes. I think I know which friend you mean. Even if there weren't Deathclaws in the quarry, there'd still be no delivery.
AID00132521	The supplier, a guy in Primm named Tyrone, is a cheating son of a bitch who won't deliver even though he's already been paid in advance.
AID00132522	Where can I find the rest of the Great Khans?
AID00132523	Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come on in.
AID00132524	The NCR can't touch us there - too many places for us to ambush them. We see their scouts poking around once in awhile, but they keep their distance.
AID00132525	What happened between the Great Khans and the NCR?
AID00132526	Bitter Springs happened. Women and children died when the NCR attacked the Great Khans there, and the NCR just pretends it never happened.
AID00132527	<Lie> Just trying to get on the good side of the Great Khans.
AID00132528	That's a smart move. The Great Khans look out for their friends.
AID00132529	Let's talk about something else.
AID00132530	Let's talk about something else now.
AID00132531	Tell me about the Great Khans.
AID00132532	We're an independent group. We take care of our own and don't take crap from anybody, especially the NCR.
AID00132533	I got the chems for you.
AID00132534	You actually came through for us. I... didn't expect that. Anyway, the Great Khans pay their debts and don't forget their friends.
AID00132535	If you ever come out to Red Rock Canyon, I'll put in a good word for you.
AID00132536	Anything else I should know?
AID00132537	Don't kill anybody if you don't have to. I'm a scout, and I like to keep a low profile.
AID00132538	Got it. Let's talk about something else.
AID00132539	Like what?
AID00132540	Are these chemicals dangerous?
AID00132541	I wouldn't eat or drink them, but no, they won't explode if you drop them or anything.
AID00132542	Well, I am expecting to be paid, of course.
AID00132543	That's a motive I can understand.
AID00132544	A favor for a favor.
AID00132545	All right, fair enough. You help us out, and I'll owe you one.
AID00132546	No angle. I just want to help.
AID00132547	Right. All right, here's the deal.
AID00132548	I was expecting a shipment of chemicals. It's usually in a suitcase dropped off in one of the big machines up here.
AID00132549	Because of the Deathclaws, I have to assume that the suitcase is still in Sloan. Snoop around the place and get it for me.
AID00132550	Seems like an odd place to pick up a delivery.
AID00132551	The Khans and the NCR don't get along - they prefer to shoot us on sight, even if we're not looking for a fight.
AID00132552	What kind of delivery are you expecting?
AID00132553	Supplies to make chems. The NCR's the best source since they're hard to come by anywhere else.
AID00132554	We don't really use the chems ourselves, just sell them to anybody with the caps. If it ends up hurting the NCR in the process, that's a bonus.
AID00132555	I'll help you with your problem.
AID00132556	Is that right? What's your angle?
AID00132557	I know something of your reputation with my gang, and I can't be seen working with you. Sorry, but I'll handle this.
AID00132558	What are you doing up here?
AID00132559	Awaiting a delivery, but it's a no-show. I'm guessing that the Deathclaws in the quarry have something to do with that.
AID00132560	I'm looking for some Great Khans who stole something from me in Goodsprings.
AID00132561	The only Khans this far into NCR territory is me and my crew, and I didn't steal squat from you.
AID00132562	Besides, even if some of my gang did steal from you, I wouldn't rat them out. Loyalty actually means something to the Great Khans.
AID00132563	As far as I know, it's just me and my crew out here, and if it really was Great Khans who mugged you, they didn't come this way. I'd have seen 'em.
AID00132564	Goodbye.
AID00132565	Don't leave a trail.
AID00132566	< Medicine - 30 >

AID00132577	<snuffle>
AID00132578	Will the White Glove Society ally with Caesar now?
AID00132579	I should think so, but it would be up to Marjorie.
AID00132580	I have, however, told her how instrumental you were in revolutionizing our cuisine. And she knows what we stand to gain from a ruler who supports it.
AID00132581	Have a word with her, see what she says. I daresay she'll be more receptive with these new developments.
AID00132582	Do you have a means of changing her mind? Something I can do?
AID00132583	Caesar wishes to extend your society an offer of alliance with his Legion.
AID00132584	Tell your ruler we have no interest in such ties. Caesar's Legion is a collection of unclean barbarians.
AID00132585	Any time the White Glove Society is mentioned in the same breath, it sullies our good name.
AID00132586	As much as Mortimer and some of the other members have tried to convince me otherwise, I will not have us seen as savages.
AID00132587	Looking to elevate his social status, is he?
AID00132588	I'll admit, I could see benefits to living under his rule. Certain... transgressions he'd be willing to overlook.
AID00132589	But that's neither here nor there, I'm afraid. Marjorie won't have it, as long as she fails to see the wisdom of my perspective.
AID00132590	I don't care for their incivility or the hodgepodge of sporting equipment that passes for fashion with them.
AID00132591	Nevertheless, I have heard Caesar has a stately dignity about him. And I understand his policies will agree with our new menu.
AID00132592	I prefer Mr. House, of course, but he may not be around forever. And the NCR will surely set back our cuisine. Tell your Mr. Caesar we are with him.
AID00132593	Tell me about yourself.
AID00132594	Momma always told me not to talk to strangers, but you seem like a nice person.
AID00132595	Momma left me on a farm when she went out prospecting, but when she never came back, the owner didn't want me around and kicked me out on my own.
AID00132596	A nice guy came up and asked me if I wanted to join the NCR so I did. Now the Troopers are my family. I like it here. Everyone is so nice.
AID00132597	What do you know about the President's visit?
AID00132598	He's coming to give a big fancy speech to all of us troops stationed here at the dam.
AID00132599	I'm pretty excited. He seems like such a nice guy and I get to meet him.
AID00132600	He's giving me a medal. I don't know why though. I'm just doing my job like all the other guys. I'm still excited though.
AID00132601	I can't believe someone killed President Kimball. He was such a nice guy, why would anyone want to hurt him?
AID00132602	I can't believe someone wanted to kill President Kimball. I'm glad he got out of here safe.
AID00132603	Your helmet is right over there.
AID00132604	It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
AID00132605	Thanks mister, you're the greatest.
AID00132606	It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
AID00132607	There it is! Thanks lady, you're the greatest.
AID00132608	What are you doing here?
AID00132609	So you have to do whatever Lawson tells you.
AID00132610	No, man. That's just what I'm supposed to do.
AID00132611	But when he tells me to push the middle button to divert the intake, and the right button feels nicer when I touch it, I know where my loyalty is.
AID00132612	Man, I just don't know how an idiot like that gets put in charge of anything.
AID00132613	They put you in charge of Hoover Dam?
AID00132614	They sure as shit did. I mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by Lawson before I do it.
AID00132615	But do I ever do that? Is his name Fantastic?
AID00132616	What are your responsibilities now?
AID00132617	Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down.
AID00132618	People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
AID00132619	Like, hey  Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
AID00132620	Get this straight. You're not my master.
AID00132621	Whoa, hey. All right, man. It's cool. Who said anything about being your master?
AID00132622	I'm just the guy who tells you to do the stuff you do before you do it.
AID00132623	Fantastic? What are you doing here?
AID00132624	What's it look like, man? I'm fucking king of the NCR. Caesar's Legion has Caesar, the NCR's got Fantastic. It's Fantastic's NCR now.
AID00132625	This whole war's about power, man. Caesar wants it. NCR wants it. Fantastic's got it.
AID00132626	After I fixed HELIOS One and basically saved the NCR from the dumbshits who run it, I got myself a little promotion. Now I run the whole shebang.
AID00132627	He was hurting you?
AID00132628	Ever since he lost his job a few years back he hasn't been the same. He took a switch to us for the tiniest things.
AID00132629	We were trying to get away when the legion showed up. I'm glad he ran off like a coward, but slavery wasn't the kind of escape I was looking for.
AID00132630	Goodbye.
AID00132631	Anything you can do to help, just please get us out of here.
AID00132632	[Lie] Do you mean the helmet I just threw off the dam?
AID00132633	Ha ha, you big joker you. You're funny. I like you.
AID00132634	I really need to find my helmet though. Thanks anyway.
AID00132635	I haven't seen it.
AID00132636	That's too bad. I need it for the ceremony. I need to look my best and I need my lucky helmet.
AID00132637	I'll just have to keep looking. Thanks anyway.
AID00132638	It's right over there.
AID00132639	<First Dialog by Watson to Player>
AID00132640	Have you seen my helmet? I can't seem to find it.
AID00132641	I've already destroyed their bunker.
AID00132642	You have?
AID00132643	It's a good thing we stopped the Omertas in time.
AID00132644	Indeed. Moving on...
AID00132645	They had it coming. The Omertas disgust me!
AID00132646	The Omertas were clever, but no match for me.
AID00132647	Arrogance was their undoing. There might be a lesson in that. But moving on...
AID00132648	I'm going to kill you now, Mr. House.
AID00132649	After all that we've accomplished?
AID00132650	The Omertas? No thanks.
AID00132651	I'll check into the Omertas.
AID00132652	The Omertas are fanatically loyal to each other. Still, among any group, one can find the occasional degenerate.
AID00132653	Gomorrah's receptionist happens to be one. For years she passed on whispers of what was taking place at the casino, in exchange for payment.
AID00132654	A few months ago, she clammed up. Odds are she's scared, but I've had no way of approaching her. Start with her.
AID00132655	The print-out I've given you lists every lead I've been able to uncover. See what you can find out.
AID00132656	Let me think about it.
AID00132657	There's nothing to think about. You have a job to do, so do it.
AID00132658	What do you want me to do?
AID00132659	Simple - an NCR Ranger named Grant is in charge of security arrangements for the visit. Present yourself to him, let him know you want to help.
AID00132660	Given your reputation, it's a near-certainty that he'll accept your offer.
AID00132661	Don't dally. The precise time of Kimball's visit is a closely-guarded secret, but it will happen soon.
AID00132662	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
AID00132663	Don't tell me that you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
AID00132664	In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
AID00132665	Any possibility of a diplomatic solution?
AID00132666	We're talking about a coterie of bulging-eyed fanatics who think all Pre-War technology belongs to them.
AID00132667	They'll never accept my using an army of robots to defend New Vegas. While it's a fight I can win, I'd rather sidestep it altogether.
AID00132668	Where do you want me to start?
AID00132669	Since 2278, I've lost five roaming Securitrons near Hidden Valley.
AID00132670	I didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
AID00132671	It's obvious that the Brotherhood has a base in Hidden Valley or thereabouts. Finding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
AID00132672	The Boomers have already vowed to help me out.
AID00132673	The Boomers and I had a disagreement a while back. I pretty much wiped them out.
AID00132674	If I want more work, I'll come see you.
AID00132675	You laid the foundation for my victory, so fine - I'll permit some latitude in how you schedule your work.
AID00132676	You're welcome.
AID00132677	Tell me about the mission.
AID00132678	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00132679	<Decline quest to neutralize Boomers.>
AID00132680	I've done enough work for you for the moment.
AID00132681	I'll make sure they support the right side.
AID00132682	Use extreme caution when approaching the base. Their firepower is... considerable.
AID00132683	Recently, one of my roaming Securitrons observed a man near the base studying the pattern of its artillery fire. Maybe he's learned something.
AID00132684	I've come here to kill you, Mr. House. <Attack Mr. House.>
AID00132685	Why is good help so impossible to find?
AID00132686	I've done enough work for you.
AID00132687	I offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
AID00132688	What's the next step?
AID00132689	Outside New Vegas, at what was once called Nellis Air Force Base, resides an unusual tribe known as the Boomers.
AID00132690	They are, shall we say, aggressively reclusive? They have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
AID00132691	Artillery of this sort has a range of several miles. If it's going to fire on Hoover Dam, I want it firing at my targets.
AID00132692	If not, then I want to make sure that the Boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the NCR or Caesar's Legion.
AID00132693	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
AID00132694	This is getting creepy. I'm leaving, and don't follow me.
AID00132695	Fine. Just do me a favor. If you find more of those things, and plan on keeping them, watch out for a man named Allen Marks.
AID00132696	He's killed more than a few people to collect as many of those caps as he can, and your ignorance as to what they are won't protect you.
AID00132697	Why didn't you say anything then and there?
AID00132698	I had to make sure of your disposition. There's a lot of jumpy folks out there that'd shoot a man as soon as talk to him.
AID00132699	Now that's we're conversing, though, I can tell you what I know about those caps.
AID00132700	What's so special about these caps?
AID00132701	There's an old wasteland legend that says somewhere out there is a fabulous treasure from before the war.
AID00132702	Those caps with the blue star on them, the tale goes, are the key to that treasure. They're called Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
AID00132703	Don't follow me. You'll live longer.
AID00132704	Okay, you're a dangerous sort. I get that. But I have some information I think you'll find useful, which made me follow you for a spell.
AID00132705	Go on.
AID00132706	Why were you following me?
AID00132707	It started off innocently enough. I was traveling, as I often do, and happened to observe you picking up one of those blue-star caps.
AID00132708	You didn't show any reaction to it, so I figured you didn't know what you'd gotten your hands on.
AID00132709	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
AID00132710	Where can I find more of these caps?
AID00132711	So you collect these caps too?
AID00132712	<Questions>
AID00132713	Same stuff. Any NCR weapons, computer parts, or radio parts.
AID00132714	I'll need more than that. Keep looking.
AID00132715	Alright, thanks for the help. Time to die loser.
AID00132716	<Questions>
AID00132717	Anything branded by the NCR related to weapons, computers, or radios.
AID00132718	There's gotta be more than that, keep looking.
AID00132719	Alright, we can move on now. Here's the key to the Fire Station.
AID00132720	<Questions>
AID00132721	It's about damn time. You ready to go?
AID00132722	<Questions>
AID00132723	Tell you what. Bring us those suits, and you can come with us while we loot the town. You can keep a share.
AID00132724	<Questions>
AID00132725	That's none of your damn business.
AID00132726	Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
AID00132727	Name's Logan. What the hell do you want?
AID00132728	<Placeholder>
AID00132729	Not much, I'm afraid. What do you want to know?
AID00132730	<Questions>
AID00132731	Yeah, I am. What of it?
AID00132732	<Questions>
AID00132733	Are you sure about that?
AID00132734	<Questions>
AID00132735	I'm here because I have nowhere else to go.
AID00132736	You aren't feral are you?
AID00132737	No, I'm not. Not yet anyway. I'm Private Kyle Edwards, former NCR trooper.
AID00132738	<Placeholder>
AID00132739	The rangers at Echo have been keeping an eye on that place. It's relatively new, but those bastards have already dug in.
AID00132740	They appear to be running a slave-trading operation and it also seems to be one of the primary crossing points for Legion raiding parties.
AID00132741	Let's hear it.
AID00132742	Let's hear it.
AID00132743	I'm still working on it.
AID00132744	Better get back to it then, I don't want those poor soldiers suffering for longer than they have to.
AID00132745	I found the location of the radiation suits.
AID00132746	I found the radiation suits.
AID00132747	Are you looking for something?
AID00132748	The radscorpions are gone.
AID00132749	Why are you still here?
AID00132750	How did you meet Doctor Henry?
AID00132751	He and I had joined up with the same caravan. Add in a lot of whiskey, and, well, let's just say we got to know each other.
AID00132752	Let's talk about Rey's brain.
AID00132753	Like I said before, give me 700 caps and Rey's brain is yours.
AID00132754	Never mind.
AID00132755	All right, then.
AID00132756	< Barter 70 >
AID00132757	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
AID00132758	I'm offering Rey immortality of a sort. Are you really going to put a price on that?
AID00132759	[FAILED] I happen to disagree. 700 caps, and that's my one and only offer.
AID00132760	It's just a dog's brain. I don't think it's worth that many caps.
AID00132761	Deal. Here's 700 caps.
AID00132762	Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
AID00132763	I'll be back in a bit.
AID00132764	I don't have the caps with me right now.
AID00132765	No worries. I'll hold onto those parts for you.
AID00132766	Why do they call you Old Lady Gibson?
AID00132767	Well, I'll give you a hint - they used to just call me Gibson. I hope you can figure out the rest.
AID00132768	I don't mind, to be honest. Living long is a real accomplishment these days. Remains to be seen if I end up dying peaceful in my bed.
AID00132769	250 caps it is. Here you go.
AID00132770	A pleasure doing business with you.
AID00132771	Never mind.
AID00132772	Okay.
AID00132773	500 caps it is. Here you go.
AID00132774	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00132775	< Speech - 50 >
AID00132776	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Yes, you are quite the smoothtalker. What the hell - 250 it is.
AID00132777	But you're going to cut the price to 250 because I'm just that charming, right?
AID00132778	[FAILED] Oh, you're charming in your own way, I suppose. Not budging on the price for those parts, though.
AID00132779	How about a discount? I'm a nice person.
AID00132780	< Barter - 50 >
AID00132781	[SUCCEEDED] Eh, fair enough. It's not like anyone's ever wanted to buy them before. 250 caps it is.
AID00132782	250 caps. Unless you think you'll find another buyer soon for such specialized parts?
AID00132783	[FAILED] Oh, I don't know about that. Lots of folks travel by on their way to New Vegas.
AID00132784	You should cut down the price. It's not like anyone will probably buy them.
AID00132785	What can you tell me about REPCONN?
AID00132786	Sometimes it seems like I spent the better portion of my youth in that old wreck of a building.
AID00132787	Me and my hubby, may the man rest in peace, used to scavenge there. If it weren't bolted down, you can bet we took it and sold it.
AID00132788	A lot of the scrap you see around here is from REPCONN, even my favorite chair.
AID00132789	About those thrust control modules...
AID00132790	Still got them. 250 caps and they're yours.
AID00132791	Still got them. 500 caps and they're yours.
AID00132792	Do you have any thrust control modules from REPCONN in stock?
AID00132793	As it so happens, I do have some thrust modules, but they're expensive. 500 caps worth of expensive.
AID00132794	Did you ever salvage containers of radioactive material from REPCONN?
AID00132795	Certainly did. Hubby and me had an old rad meter to help us tell the difference between what you could salvage and what'd kill you.
AID00132796	I kept a glowing container from REPCONN around here for years serving no better purpose than a nightlight. Damn thing wouldn't sell.
AID00132797	Then along comes the most peculiar-looking fellow, all decked out in a yellow radiation suit, of which he was proud all out of proportion.
AID00132798	The man outright asked if I had anything radioactive for sale - imagine that! But he paid handsome for that jar of goop.
AID00132799	Only saw him that once. He said something about heading over to Clark Field to put his suit through its paces. A strange one, he was...
AID00132800	Doctor Henry sent me. I need a new brain for my cyber-dog.
AID00132801	Doctor Henry? Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Hard to believe he's still alive.
AID00132802	As for your request, it's, uh, a bit ghoulish if you ask me, but Rey is pretty old and I'll probably have to put him down soon enough.
AID00132803	As for the price for this favor, 700 caps sounds about right. Rey's like family, and I've got other dogs to take care of.
AID00132804	Goodbye.
AID00132805	Take care, now.
AID00132806	I need something repaired.
AID00132807	Sure thing. Let me have a look.
AID00132808	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00132809	Happy to do it.
AID00132810	An attractive woman like yourself all alone? Maybe you and I could work out some kind of trade...
AID00132811	I know I'm not young and pretty any more, but I appreciate the thought all the same. Here, take the parts, you flatterer.
AID00132812	What do you know about HELIOS One?
AID00132813	The way I heard it, the Brotherhood of Steel ran the place before the NCR took it away from them. I'm not sure who started shooting first.
AID00132814	But, when it was over, the Brotherhood, with all their fancy armor and weapons, was on the run. Nobody's heard from them since.
AID00132815	I'll make sure the Boomers support the right side.
AID00132816	I am pale Death come to bear you to Perdition.
AID00132817	I don't need your help. I'm going to carve myself a key from your bones.
AID00132818	Jesus. You're a real goddamn psycho.
AID00132819	It'll be more fun if we keep it a mystery. Besides, I'm more interested in you.
AID00132820	You're right. I'm sorry. That imbecile in the next room has me on edge. I used to be more fun.
AID00132821	I'm still passionate about my work though. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
AID00132822	I'm in the Followers of the Apocalypse. How about you?
AID00132823	How about you and I come to another arrangement. It'll be worth it - trust me.
AID00132824	Well, it has been awhile. All right, let's do this.
AID00132825	You mentioned someone named Festus. Who's that?
AID00132826	It's said that the treasure is guarded by a man named Festus, and he's the one who asks for the blue-star caps.
AID00132827	It's also said that he's been around since the war, standing a lonely vigil, waiting for someone to come and take the treasure off his hands.
AID00132828	That'd make him pretty damn old, but I've met a few people in my travels who claimed they actually met him, and they weren't the lying type either.
AID00132829	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
AID00132830	No one knows. Money? Weapons? Water? It is, or maybe was, something of value, and that's enough to get people motivated.
AID00132831	Thanks for the info, but I'll be going now.
AID00132832	So you collect these caps too?
AID00132833	Nah, I gave it up years ago. Too dangerous. And even if I did still collect them, I'd tell you the same.
AID00132834	There's people out there so mad with the idea of treasure that they'll attack strangers just on the suspicion that they have some of those caps.
AID00132835	Where can I find more of these caps?
AID00132836	All over the place. The easiest place to find them is unopened bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla.
AID00132837	You'd think they'd all have been picked clean by now, but somehow new bottles keep appearing in the machines.
AID00132838	Some say it's old Festus that does it, hoping someone will finally collect enough caps to earn the treasure.
AID00132839	Other than bottles, you'll just have to scavenge. You can find caps in the unlikeliest of places, and blue-star caps are no exception.
AID00132840	SSHQFestusLHStart
AID00132841	If this is your first rodeo with the ol' horseshoes, say "How do I play?". Otherwise, say "Lucky Horseshoes" to begin.
AID00132842	I feel lucky.
AID00132843	SSHQLHHelperTopic
AID00132844	
AID00132845	I'm done.
AID00132846	Play again.
AID00132847	<Press the yellow button to quit.>
AID00132848	That's too bad. Ol' Festus was looking forward to a good tussle.
AID00132849	What is this place?
AID00132850	Just a little rest stop that me and my good friend Lupe set up. Last stop on your way into New Vegas, first stop on your way out, that's what I say.
AID00132851	Crops in Westside - the apparent water shortage here can't be a coincidence, then.
AID00132852	I... really don't see the connection. Look, I'm a soldier, not a scientist. I just do my job.
AID00132853	The fields should be getting their full supply of water again.
AID00132854	That's... great? So there was a problem, after all. Huh. Well, I'm not a scientist, so it's not my fault if I didn't see anything wrong.
AID00132855	What is this place?
AID00132856	The Old Mormon Fort serves as the regional hub for the Followers of the Apocalypse. I am the administrator for this region.
AID00132857	What do you do here?
AID00132858	The Followers of the Apocalypse aren't just interested in research. We care for our fellow man and do everything we can to help humanity.
AID00132859	Here in Freeside, we provide food and medical services for those in need. We have also organized reconstruction efforts.
AID00132860	With the help of Bill Ronte, we were able to install a water pump just west of here, but the Kings quickly took control of the pump.
AID00132861	Who are the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00132862	We arose from the Boneyards of Adytum years ago. Since then, we have made it our mission to rebuild the wasteland and reeducate its inhabitants.
AID00132863	We hope to forge a brave new world free of war and poverty by sharing knowledge and resources. Our primary goal is the free exchange of ideas.
AID00132864	What do you know about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00132865	They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
AID00132866	They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
AID00132867	What can you tell me about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00132868	They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
AID00132869	They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
AID00132870	I think I'll be going.
AID00132871	I've already met with Caesar at the Fort.
AID00132872	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
AID00132873	Going to the Fort sounds insane.
AID00132874	So what do you want me to do at Fortification Hill?
AID00132875	You want me to kill Caesar?
AID00132876	Absolutely not! Caesar is of great use to me.
AID00132877	I don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
AID00132878	<Lie> Beats me.
AID00132879	I don't think that's the whole story, but fuck it. I'm going back to Red Rock. I've had enough of this place.
AID00132880	He was sloppy and trusted the wrong person.
AID00132881	Well, fuck. I can't believe I'm going back to Red Rock empty-handed. Thanks for trying to help.
AID00132882	Simple. I turned him in.
AID00132883	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! You're going to pay for that!
AID00132884	Your supplier was exposed. There won't be any more chemical supplies.
AID00132885	Uh-huh. And how exactly was he exposed?
AID00132886	LtHayesVMS04HideChomps
AID00132887	All right. Thanks for all your help.
AID00132888	<Lie> No, there wasn't anyone else.
AID00132889	LtHayesVMS04ExposeChomps
AID00132890	All right. I'll have him brought in for questioning.
AID00132891	Chomps Lewis, the foreman at Sloan, was also involved.
AID00132892	LtHayesVMS04ExposeTyrone
AID00132893	Tyrone wasn't authorized to deliver any of this. There were reports of our supplies being used by the Great Khans to make illegal chems.
AID00132894	Until now, we've never had any hard evidence. Most of the chems end up with the Fiends, a group of crazies the NCR tangles with regularly.
AID00132895	We'll have to conduct a thorough investigation of all our quartermasters, and crack down on sloppy record-keeping. Thank you.
AID00132896	Other than Tyrone, were any other NCR citizens involved in this smuggling operation?
AID00132897	Tyrone has been selling chemical supplies to the Great Khans. Here - I got these from him.
AID00132898	I'm sorry, but all these muscles make it hard to hear sometimes. What was that about risk?
AID00132899	Uh, never mind. Take the supplies. All yours, friend.
AID00132900	LtMarklandTraining
AID00132901	Thank you, that was very helpful. I don't think I'll need those books after all.
AID00132902	Not yet, but I had some questions.
AID00132903	Sure, just make them quick.
AID00132904	Good luck on your journey.
AID00132905	Thanks. See you around.
AID00132906	Actually, I have a few questions first.
AID00132907	Okay, but keep it quick. I'd like to get out of here before the Legionnaires come to check on me.
AID00132908	I think you're better off where you are. Hang around, I'll be back.
AID00132909	No! God, please!
AID00132910	Are you Anders? Jack and Diane sent me to look for you.
AID00132911	Thank God. Let me down, please!
AID00132912	They did? Heh. Probably mostly Jack's idea, he always was the soft touch.
AID00132913	Thanks. You've saved my life, and done the Great Khans a huge favor. I'll be heading back to Red Rock Canyon now - maybe we'll see each other there.
AID00132914	Let's get you down from there.
AID00132915	Unnnh.
AID00132916	You're smuggling drugs?
AID00132917	Please... for the love of God, let me down!
AID00132918	Well, not exactly. More like... trying to expand our markets. I heard there was a lot of untapped territory down south, but the Legion caught me.
AID00132919	Who did this to you?
AID00132920	Unh... Legion caught me. Said this... was the penalty for drug runners. Please... let me down.
AID00132921	A Legion patrol caught me trying to cross the river. When they found the, umm, package I was carrying, they strung me up there.
AID00132922	What do you think of the Great Khans?
AID00132923	They're a tribe of fine warriors, with many proud traditions and a glorious history. They will be worthy additions to the Legion.
AID00132924	[SUCCEEDED] Join? Oh, no, I simply couldn't. That is... I'm not worthy of such an honor.
AID00132925	I've been wondering why you don't petition the Khans for membership as a show of allegiance.
AID00132926	[FAILED] Alas, my first loyalty is to Caesar, and a soldier cannot have two masters.
AID00132927	Who are you?
AID00132928	My name is Karl. Glorious Caesar has sent me as an emissary to the Great Khans as a token of our alliance.
AID00132929	You march all the way out to Red Rock Canyon, enter my home as bold as you please, and you have no idea who I am? You've got guts, I'll give you that.
AID00132930	Well, then, let me educate you: I am the chief of the Great Khans - the Khan of Khans, if you like. This is my tribe and these are my people.
AID00132931	Name's Regis - I'm Papa Khan's advisor and right-hand man. I'm also the chief enforcer of the tribe's laws - so watch your behavior.
AID00132932	Regis says I should talk to you about speaking against the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AID00132933	You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
AID00132934	I've been told you're someone I should talk to about stopping the Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AID00132935	Don't worry, Jack and I have talked it over. We'll talk up the idea of breaking the alliance.
AID00132936	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
AID00132937	Anders got back a little while before you did, he told me what happened. If that's how the Legion treats my people, I don't want any part of them.
AID00132938	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
AID00132939	Hey, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
AID00132940	I'm here to ask you to publicly oppose Papa Khan's alliance with Caesar.
AID00132941	Oh, it's cool, man. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
AID00132942	Oh, it's cool, man, I got your back.
AID00132943	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AID00132944	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AID00132945	Oh, it's cool, kitten. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
AID00132946	Oh, it's cool, kitty cat, I got your back.
AID00132947	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AID00132948	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AID00132949	Tell me about Papa Khan.
AID00132950	Papa is one of the best leaders the Khans have ever had. He's kept us together through all of our hardships, ever since we left California.
AID00132951	Bitter Springs changed him, though. He started to really hate the NCR after the Massacre, and sometimes I worry that's poisoned his mind.
AID00132952	What's your opinion of the NCR?
AID00132953	That's a complicated question. They've done horrible things to our people to be sure, and I've gladly killed many of their soldiers in battle.
AID00132954	But I can't bring myself to hate them the way Papa does. Things would damn sure be better for us if they were in charge than Caesar.
AID00132955	You're the chief now. What do we do?
AID00132956	I want to talk to you about the fate of the Great Khans.
AID00132957	Without Papa Khan's guidance, I don't know what else to do. All right - you can tell the NCR the Great Khans will fight for them when Caesar attacks.
AID00132958	Now that you're in command, will you lead the Khans against Caesar and fight for the NCR?
AID00132959	RegisCaesar
AID00132960	I heard you try to convince Papa Khan not to join with Caesar's Legion. I'd like to talk to you about that for a moment.
AID00132961	Let me see. My God, this is even worse than I thought. Okay, you have my support. I'll tell Papa the alliance is a bad idea.
AID00132962	Have a look at this book. It will show you what happens to tribes that "ally" with Caesar's Legion.
AID00132963	What do you want to know?
AID00132964	I'd like to talk more about the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AID00132965	You should look at this. It's Karl's journal, and it's very revealing of his true opinions.
AID00132966	Let me see that... "filthy savages? Probably have to decimate the lot of them?" Are these the words of our "friend," Caesar?
AID00132967	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AID00132968	What's this? Ah, yes, I've heard that the Legion has sometimes had to quell tribes that did not share its vision.
AID00132969	The Khans, though, are protected by Caesar's emissary - I have Karl's word we will remain our own tribe as long as we remain loyal to Caesar.
AID00132970	Take your slander elsewhere.
AID00132971	This is a ledger from Caesar's camp, showing what Karl really has planned for the Great Khans.
AID00132972	Can you tell me about your people?
AID00132973	You want to hear the story of the Great Khans? It's a long one, full of honor, glory and betrayal. We have suffered, but we will regain our glory.
AID00132974	I've come to ask the Great Khans to break their alliance with Caesar's Legion.
AID00132975	Have you now? Hmm. Well, you're a bold one, I'll give you that, but why should I do this for you?
AID00132976	Hmm. I have heard some things from my most trusted Khans that makes me wonder whether this alliance is a good idea after all.
AID00132977	But I want to leave a legacy of greatness when I die. My tribe deserves better than this, cowering in a canyon and living on scraps.
AID00132978	Tell me then, if I don't join with Caesar's Legion, where will I find my tribe's lost glory?
AID00132979	Is this delivery legal?
AID00132980	I doubt the NCR thinks so. Heh.
AID00132981	That's too bad.
AID00132982	Yeah, but those are the rules.
AID00132983	Come on!
AID00132984	Not a chance.
AID00132985	Pretty please?
AID00132986	Okay, just this once. Make it quick though, I don't want to get in trouble for this.
AID00132987	I've always wanted to see the President's vertibird.
AID00132988	Sorry, no can do.
AID00132989	Who's authorized to go upstairs?
AID00132990	Only NCR engineers or people with explicit permission from Ranger Grant are allowed roof access.
AID00132991	If you have to ask, you're not authorized.
AID00132992	Why the lockdown?
AID00132993	The President is visiting today. Ranger Grant doesn't want anyone snooping around up there that doesn't have authorization.
AID00132994	May I have permission to go on the roof of the Visitor Center?
AID00132995	The Brotherhood of Steel knew about ARCHIMEDES?
AID00132996	I would think you'd know better than I. But perhaps they kept their operation here a secret, even from members of their own order.
AID00132997	They weren't here for me to ask, but I doubt they were here for electricity.
AID00132998	When the NCR first came here, it was under Brotherhood control. They usually steer clear of one another, but something here changed their minds.
AID00132999	The Brotherhood's interest in Pre-War technology has always been in weapons. It's likely they were trying to reclaim ARCHIMEDES when the NCR arrived.
AID00133000	Why was the Brotherhood of Steel here?
AID00133001	Damned if I know. Put up a hell of a fight, though. We had them outnumbered, I don't know, twenty to one, maybe.
AID00133002	They held out as long as they could. Lost most of their force before they retreated. Gave us a little parting gift, too.
AID00133003	They had some of the plant running, but they shut it all down. Enabled an old security system, too, to keep us away from the controls. Jerkoffs.
AID00133004	I have another question.
AID00133005	By all means.
AID00133006	Go on.
AID00133007	Other things weren't lost, but were blocked from our collective memory. Knowledge of what we're capable of, and how things spiral out of control.
AID00133008	It's in our nature to want to forget truths that keep us awake at night.
AID00133009	And for that reason it's all the more important that the Followers walk the wastes to remind people of them.
AID00133010	Do the Followers work together with the NCR?
AID00133011	We did, for a time. But our goals differ. The NCR only cares to expand their wealth and their reach.
AID00133012	For us, territorial boundaries mean nothing. And prosperity has to be for everyone, not just citizens of the NCR.
AID00133013	So a parting was inevitable. While the NCR pushes east, we clean up the mess they leave behind. Try to provide some stability.
AID00133014	Where are the Followers based around here?
AID00133015	We're scattered, mostly. We go where we're needed. Our largest presence is in Freeside at Old Mormon Fort.
AID00133016	Other than that, I know Dr. Usanagi set up a practice near the Crimson Caravan. And a man we trained is operating out of the Aerotech building.
AID00133017	Another man, Tom Anderson, was looking into water supply problems in Westside. But that was a while ago.
AID00133018	How did you end up joining the Great Khans?
AID00133019	It wasn't easy. There's a lot of initiation rituals to go through, and I've got the scars to prove it.
AID00133020	But, in the end, I was tough enough to be made a member. Proudest day of my life.
AID00133021	Can I ask you about Private Edwards?
AID00133022	Where should I go instead?
AID00133023	If the area is filled with radiation, why are you still here?
AID00133024	I was stationed at Camp Searchlight before the incident.
AID00133025	I've since taken it upon myself to keep travelers away from the area.
AID00133026	<Questions>
AID00133027	Who is Private Edwards?
AID00133028	<Questions>
AID00133029	Head north toward Novac. Look for a big dinosaur, can't miss it.
AID00133030	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133031	Sure, what's on your mind?
AID00133032	What happened?
AID00133033	Some Legionaries snuck into the camp and set off some kind of radiation bomb.
AID00133034	I don't know where they got it, but it was damn effective. Killed almost everyone and turned the rest into ghouls.
AID00133035	Are there any other survivors?
AID00133036	None that aren't feral ghouls. Those poor bastards - I can't imagine how they must be suffering.
AID00133037	I'd like to put them out of their misery but I don't have the heart to do it. Can you do me a favor?
AID00133038	SSHQAllenMarksAudioLog01
AID00133039	I guess this is it. Not much air left now. Minutes, maybe. And this is what I have to show for it.
AID00133040	Guess the joke's <gasps air> on me. Prolly shouldn't have killed... all those people. Prolly shoulda stayed at home... and taken care of my ma.
AID00133041	She... always used to say people who... murder and steal... die bad in the end. Said they...
AID00133042	LtHayesVMS04ChompsDead
AID00133043	I see. Thanks for saving us the trouble.
AID00133044	There was another man involved at Sloan, but he's dead.
AID00133045	Alright, I'll do it.
AID00133046	Why do you want to kill them?
AID00133047	Those boys aren't themselves anymore. They're in pain, and you don't let good men suffer like that.
AID00133048	Those troopers deserve a clean death.
AID00133049	Sure I'll do it.
AID00133050	Thank you. Could you bring me their dog tags? Some of the troopers should still be wearing them.
AID00133051	I'll give you some caps for each one you bring back to me. There's an old rifle in it for you if you can bring me at least 10.
AID00133052	Oh and take these radiation supplies. You'll need them.
AID00133053	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
AID00133054	Alright, I'll do it.
AID00133055	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
AID00133056	Alright, I'll help.
AID00133057	I'm gonna need more than that if you want my help.
AID00133058	[FAILED] Sorry I don't have anything else to offer.
AID00133059	[SUCCEEDED]I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
AID00133060	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
AID00133061	I understand.
AID00133062	What's in it for me?
AID00133063	We don't get many supplies out here, but I can offer you some caps and maybe some old gear.
AID00133064	What kind of favor?
AID00133065	I want you to put down the troopers that... changed. Turned into ghouls.
AID00133066	How did they get into the camp?
AID00133067	I don't know, unfortunately. There may be clues somewhere inside the camp, but I'm not about to run in there to find out.
AID00133068	How did you survive?
AID00133069	I was out on patrol at the time so I wasn't in the camp when it happened.
AID00133070	There were a few others with me after it happened, including some of my superiors.
AID00133071	Between radiation poisoning and attacks by the Legion they all died out.
AID00133072	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133073	Sure.
AID00133074	I'll go ask him about it.
AID00133075	Good luck with that.
AID00133076	Is there somewhere else he can go?
AID00133077	There's a ranger station north of here that has a few ghouls running it. Maybe they'll take him in.
AID00133078	He isn't showing any signs of going feral.
AID00133079	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't take that risk.
AID00133080	[SUCCEEDED] Well, maybe I can give him a chance.
AID00133081	Maybe Edwards can help you?
AID00133082	[FAILED] I'd rather not take the chance.
AID00133083	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll give him a shot.
AID00133084	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133085	Sure.
AID00133086	But he isn't feral.
AID00133087	Doesn't mean he isn't suffering, or that he won't go feral eventually.
AID00133088	Nevermind, can I ask you something else?
AID00133089	Sure.
AID00133090	He is a ghoul in Camp Searchlight.
AID00133091	If he's a ghoul he should be put down. I can't let a rabid dog suffer.
AID00133092	What kind of creatures?
AID00133093	Mostly ghouls, and a handful of radscorps. I think some geckos moved in not too long ago.
AID00133094	They seem to stick mostly to the south end of the camp.
AID00133095	Why Novac?
AID00133096	Because it's a far safer place to be than here.
AID00133097	What's so dangerous about this place?
AID00133098	The whole area is irradiated and filled with mutated creatures.
AID00133099	You're a mutant, too. Wouldn't the Nightkin listen to you?
AID00133100	That's like saying Caesar and Kimball would listen to each other. Nightkin don't have a lot of trust for others, mutants included.
AID00133101	There may be a battle in the near future at the Hoover Dam, can you offer any assistance?
AID00133102	Of course my child. After all that you have done for us we would love to help you in the upcoming battle.
AID00133103	After all the training in virtual reality, the young ones would relish an opportunity to put their skills to battle. We'll be there when you need us.
AID00133104	We have our ears on the radio waves. When the fighting starts you can count on our air support.
AID00133105	Are you and your people still ready to help in the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam?
AID00133106	How are things, now that the battle for Hoover Dam is over?
AID00133107	Why are you still here?
AID00133108	Keeping watch, mostly. Trying to make sure the dangers of this plant are minimized.
AID00133109	What will you do now?
AID00133110	I'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
AID00133111	But here's a little taste. You know how you can only collect sunlight during the day? What if you could make it daytime all the time?
AID00133112	Crazy, right? Or is it? I'm gonna find somebody smart and ask him that question, see what he says. It'll be fucking intense.
AID00133113	You're with the Legion?
AID00133114	Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magic angel wings.
AID00133115	They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
AID00133116	Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
AID00133117	Is Ignacio dead over there? Did you kill him?
AID00133118	Man, I don't even know. It's crazy.
AID00133119	That is all for now.
AID00133120	Do you see much action against the NCR?
AID00133121	As much as their cowardice will allow. The Profligates avoid open battle, but on good days we find one of their patrols.
AID00133122	Their landmines have caused us more trouble than their marksmanship - which is lacking.
AID00133123	What is your role here?
AID00133124	I'm an officer of the Legion, of the rank Decanus. When we encamped, I commanded a contubernium of eight Legionaries.
AID00133125	So I command what's left. Under the wise leadership of Centurion Aurelius, of course.
AID00133126	What is this place?
AID00133127	A Legion outpost. What's it look like?
AID00133128	We crossed the river when the Profligates fled from Searchlight. From here we stage raiding parties and process captures.
AID00133129	I have some questions.
AID00133130	Very well.
AID00133131	We're all fine here, thank you. How are you?
AID00133132	Quit goofing off and clear the channel. I'll be damned if the President dies on my watch because you were screwing around.
AID00133133	This is the last of the dog tags.
AID00133134	Thank you for the help. I can rest easier knowing those poor soldiers no longer have to suffer.
AID00133135	<no prob.>
AID00133136	No thanks.
AID00133137	At least you asked. More than some that pass through here.
AID00133138	Sounds like a deal.
AID00133139	Thanks, I appreciate it. Come back here when you're done, I might accidentally "lose" some supplies to pay you with.
AID00133140	Never mind. I'll be going now.
AID00133141	Take care - cool your heels over in the barracks, if you want.
AID00133142	Any way I can help?
AID00133143	Help? No, look, I apprec... You know, what, yes, I could use the help. And you look like you can handle yourself.
AID00133144	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
AID00133145	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
AID00133146	Ranger Station Echo up north may take you in.
AID00133147	It's either him or the wasteland.
AID00133148	I think I'll take my chances with the wasteland.
AID00133149	Don't worry, I'll talk to Astor and work it out for you.
AID00133150	Lets talk about something else first.
AID00133151	Sure.
AID00133152	Ranger Station Echo is north of here. They have ghoul troopers.
AID00133153	There's always the wasteland.
AID00133154	On second thought maybe somewhere else would work better.
AID00133155	Any ideas where I can go?
AID00133156	I'll go talk to him first.
AID00133157	Really? Thanks, I owe you one.
AID00133158	Let's talk about something else first.
AID00133159	Alright.
AID00133160	I heard Ranger Station Echo up north is manned by other ghouls.
AID00133161	There's a Ranger Station run by ghouls? Finally, I feel like I have a place to go. Thanks for your help.
AID00133162	You should work things out with First Sergeant Astor.
AID00133163	I don't know if that's such a great idea.
AID00133164	Maybe First Sergeant Astor will let you join him?
AID00133165	Are you sure he'll be okay with it? Not everyone is crazy about ghouls.
AID00133166	There are plenty of places out in the wasteland.
AID00133167	You know what? Why the hell not. There are plenty of places out there to explore, and I'm kinda tired of being stuck in this house.
AID00133168	I want to talk about something else.
AID00133169	Alright.
AID00133170	I'll take care of them. Be right back.
AID00133171	Thanks.
AID00133172	Actually lets talk about something else.
AID00133173	Ok.
AID00133174	<Lie> They are definitely all gone.
AID00133175	[FAILED] Sorry, I don't believe you.
AID00133176	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks for your help. I can finally get out of this place.
AID00133177	Well, there may still be a few out there.
AID00133178	Nope, no way. I'm not going anywhere until I know they're gone.
AID00133179	I'm positive, they're all gone.
AID00133180	Maybe it's time for me to leave this place, then. Any ideas where I can go?
AID00133181	Can I ask  you something else?
AID00133182	I suppose.
AID00133183	Can I ask you about something else then?
AID00133184	Fine.
AID00133185	There's still radiation in your house.
AID00133186	Look, just leave me alone. I'm not going outside.
AID00133187	Is that the only thing you're afraid of?
AID00133188	Radscorpions. Fuckers creep the hell out of me. I'm not going outside while they're still crawling around.
AID00133189	But ghouls are immune to radiation.
AID00133190	Yeah, but I don't want to go feral, and that's probably what more radiation would do to me.
AID00133191	Can you tell me what happened here?
AID00133192	I don't really know the details of it, it all happened too quickly. I remember being hit by a blast of energy.
AID00133193	Next thing I know, I wake up like... like this.  I've been staying in this house ever since.
AID00133194	I don't know much about what's going on outside, aside from the creatures that moved in since then.
AID00133195	Actually I have another question.
AID00133196	Alright.
AID00133197	Why haven't you gone feral yet?
AID00133198	I'm guessing it's because I'm outside of the heavy radiation areas. I'm not going outside to find out, though.
AID00133199	There must be someplace you can go.
AID00133200	Believe me, I'd love to leave, but I can't because I don't know what effect the radiation will have on me.
AID00133201	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133202	Sure.
AID00133203	You know, there's an NCR soldier outside who wants me to kill you for it.
AID00133204	He wants to kill me? What did I ever do to him?
AID00133205	Can I have your dog tag?
AID00133206	Sorry, I'm not about to give it up. It's the only thing I have left that reminds me of who I was.
AID00133207	Goodbye.
AID00133208	Later.
AID00133209	I see you're wearing an NCR dog tag.
AID00133210	[Attack] Don't worry, I'll put you out of your misery.
AID00133211	What?
AID00133212	You're right, ghouls aren't fit to be in the army.
AID00133213	Yeah, I know.
AID00133214	Maybe they'll let you back in?
AID00133215	I'm not so sure about that. I don't know how the NCR feels about ghouls.
AID00133216	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133217	I suppose.
AID00133218	Former? What happened?
AID00133219	Couldn't you tell? That damn radiation bomb got me. I can't serve the NCR like this...
AID00133220	Where should I go instead?
AID00133221	If it's filled with radiation, why are you still here?
AID00133222	CalamityToDoctorHenry01
AID00133223	Stealth field is stable, and the readings are clean. Gamma wave activity is... zero? Odd, but everything looks right.
AID00133224	The stealth field is unstable and scrambling things. This reading says gamma wave activity is zero, but that can't possibly be right.
AID00133225	Gamma wave activity is... zero? That can't be right. Must be a result of the interference.
AID00133226	DoctorHenryToCalamity01
AID00133227	How are those readings looking, Calamity?
AID00133228	I should be going.
AID00133229	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
AID00133230	Now take the Platinum Chip, go down in that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find. Now get to it. Vale.
AID00133231	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
AID00133232	Now take the Platinum Chip, go to the bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find down there.
AID00133233	And just in case you're thinking of slipping away, now that you've finally got that Platinum Chip in your hands?
AID00133234	Go ahead, try that. And I'll have you hunted down, and your head mounted on a pole. Now get to it. Vale.
AID00133235	And once I'm inside?
AID00133236	I want you to destroy whatever you find in there. And then I want you to come back here and tell me about it.
AID00133237	So go to the building and take this fucking Platinum Chip with you. My Legionaries will meet you there, with your weapons and equipment.
AID00133238	Talk to Benny on your way out. He knows I'm going to let you decide how he dies. Maybe you want to remind him.
AID00133239	Goodbye.
AID00133240	I changed my mind.
AID00133241	There was no reasonable chance of success.
AID00133242	When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
AID00133243	You lost me a great opportunity to deal a blow to the Profligates' morale. If not for the service you've rendered unto me, I'd have you crucified.
AID00133244	I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
AID00133245	I'm not going to kill the NCR's President.
AID00133246	Oh? You're going to defy me?
AID00133247	Won't killing President Kimball just anger the NCR?
AID00133248	I don't have to explain the reasoning behind my commands. I just give them - and you do them.
AID00133249	That said, every once in a while I hear something so ignorant, I have to respond. This is one of those times.
AID00133250	The Profligates' morale is in the shitter. They've occupied the Mojave for years, getting picked off one by one. They were told it'd be easy.
AID00133251	They keep being told that victory is right around the corner, that Vegas will roll over, become the sixth state of their little union.
AID00133252	It's President Kimball who's been telling them that. When he dies, the enormity of his lies will come crashing down, the punchline to a bad joke.
AID00133253	I'll kill President Kimball for you.
AID00133254	That's what I like to hear.
AID00133255	One of my Frumentarii has set up camp near Hoover Dam. His name his Cato Hostilius.
AID00133256	Go to him. He'll have further instructions.
AID00133257	I've been inside the Brotherhood's bunker, but I haven't destroyed it yet.
AID00133258	Then get yourself back there, and get it done.
AID00133259	I've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker in Hidden Valley.
AID00133260	Very well. This latest victory brings to a close my efforts to reshape the power balance of the Mojave - and not a minute too soon...
AID00133261	I won't destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00133262	Is that so?
AID00133263	Is it really necessary to destroy the Brotherhood?
AID00133264	If I say the Brotherhood should be destroyed, it's necessary.
AID00133265	My Legion can win a fight against the Brotherhood of Steel, but it would be costly. Your job is to make sure there's no Brotherhood for us to fight.
AID00133266	I'll destroy the Brotherhood.
AID00133267	Good. Two of my scouts have reported seeing patrols of men in power armor near Hidden Valley. Begin your search there.
AID00133268	I've already destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker in Hidden Valley.
AID00133269	You destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker? Very well.
AID00133270	I'll trust your word, and reward you as though you wreaked this destruction at my behest.
AID00133271	Of course, if the Brotherhood should suddenly rise up to oppose my rule, you will be held responsible. Now, moving on...
AID00133272	I'll see what I can work out with the White Glove Society.
AID00133273	The leader of the tribe is a woman named Marjorie. My understanding is that she strongly opposes a reversion to cannibalism.
AID00133274	If she's intractable, you might find Mortimer, her second-in-command, more flexible.
AID00133275	I've already won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
AID00133276	Is that so? You are good, aren't you?
AID00133277	If the Boomers will toe the line, I can focus on other preparations. But not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
AID00133278	I've already wiped out the Boomers' leadership.
AID00133279	Is that right? You are good, aren't you?
AID00133280	If the Boomers are out of the picture, I can focus on other preparations - but not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
AID00133281	I'll eliminate Mr. House for you.
AID00133282	Good. I don't know what kind of security he has inside the Lucky 38, but if you can find a way of catching him off-guard, do so.
AID00133283	Now that we've got that out of the way, I don't suppose you'd consider joining the NCR instead?
AID00133284	You've helped me see Caesar for what he is, and I thank you for that - but if you suggest that again I will have your head.
AID00133285	Hey, as long as you aren't fighting for Caesar, I don't care what you do.
AID00133286	Whatever your motivation was, I think we owe you a debt.
AID00133287	That sounds wise. I wish you the best.
AID00133288	If you should ever tire of wandering alone, seek us out. You might just have the makings of a Great Khan yourself.
AID00133289	You don't need to look outward, mighty Khan. Your tribe is proud and strong - claim your own glory!
AID00133290	[SUCCEEDED] Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
AID00133291	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AID00133292	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AID00133293	[SUCCEEDED] Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
AID00133294	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AID00133295	[FAILED] You talk like glory is a hollow, meaningless thing. Maybe to you it is, but not to the Great Khans.
AID00133296	Show me something to inspire my people, or we march with Caesar, despite my misgivings.
AID00133297	Who cares about glory? Better to live without glory than die pointlessly, if you ask me.
AID00133298	If the Great Khans join the Legion, you'll be sold as a slave. An officer's wife, if you're lucky.
AID00133299	That lying little weasel! I almost fell for it, too! All right, you've got a deal. You can tell Papa I won't support an alliance.
AID00133300	Did he also tell you women aren't permitted to serve in the Legion?
AID00133301	What? No, he... what do you mean, aren't allowed to serve? Why would he lie about that?
AID00133302	No, and finding some would be too much work. Never mind.
AID00133303	Okay, I won't bother.
AID00133304	Not yet, but I'll find some.
AID00133305	Okay, come on back when you do.
AID00133306	Caesar isn't going to let you run drugs as an ally any more than he supports it now. He hates chems.
AID00133307	I haven't heard anything like that. Do you have any proof?
AID00133308	But you won't have each other. The Legion will kill you and sell Diane into slavery as a prostitute.
AID00133309	[SUCCEEDED] Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diana got your back. No sweat.
AID00133310	[FAILED] Dude... wait, what? That's totally kakadoodle, man. You been huffing fumes in the Magic Bus or something?
AID00133311	Nothing, never mind.
AID00133312	Suit yourself.
AID00133313	Tell me again what I need to do to convince Papa.
AID00133314	I'm not afraid of Karl, and I don't feel like wasting my time on him.
AID00133315	If you say so.
AID00133316	I'll keep that in mind.
AID00133317	I would too, if I were you.
AID00133318	How would I do that?
AID00133319	Karl talks prettily about the honor and nobility of the Great Khans, but I suspect his actual opinion is less flattering.
AID00133320	Maybe you could find something he wrote that expresses that opinion, or trick him into losing his cool in the longhouse right in front of Papa.
AID00133321	I'll think about it, but I have other questions for now.
AID00133322	All right, what is it you wanted?
AID00133323	I don't think I actually want to do that.
AID00133324	I see. Then the Great Khans will fight for the Legion should Caesar give the call. If you change your mind, let me know.
AID00133325	Okay, I'll see what I can do to convince everyone.
AID00133326	Good. Oh, one more thing: Caesar's representative, Karl, has become fast friends with Papa. Karl's the one who has him so fixated on this alliance.
AID00133327	You'll probably have an easier time of things if you can find a way to get him out of the picture.
AID00133328	What about Melissa?
AID00133329	Ah, Melissa. She's a bit of a dreamer. Last time she was in camp, Karl filled her head with stories of serving the Legion as a speculatore.
AID00133330	Personally, I've never seen a woman in Legionaire's armor, so I have my doubts.
AID00133331	What would convince Jack and Diane to support me?
AID00133332	You'd have to talk to them - but those two have been thick as thieves since they were kids. Convince one and the other will come around.
AID00133333	Aren't you convinced already, if we're having this conversation?
AID00133334	I have my doubts about Caesar, yes, but I won't publicly go against Papa Khan based on nothing more than doubts.
AID00133335	I've heard rumors that tribes who aligned with Caesar in the past were torn apart and reduced to slaves - prove it, and I'll back you.
AID00133336	So what do I do?
AID00133337	Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack and Diane, and Melissa.
AID00133338	If you can convince all of us that allying with Caesar is a bad idea, you might be able to sway him.
AID00133339	Why should I listen to you?
AID00133340	Because Papa listens to me. And because I actually know how to get things done around here.
AID00133341	What is it you had in mind?
AID00133342	You want to convince Papa not to ally with Caesar, right? Trust me, you'll get nowhere just talking to him about it.
AID00133343	He's fixated on restoring the glory of the Great Khans, and he sees Caesar as the path to that restoration.
AID00133344	Who are you?
AID00133345	Name's Regis. I'm Papa's second-in-command. You might say I... share your concern about Caesar.
AID00133346	Because the NCR is the best hope for long-term stability in the region, not Caesar.
AID00133347	Don't you dare mention the NCR under this roof. They are butchers without honor, killers of women and children!
AID00133348	Do you really think Caesar is going to restore your tribe to glory? You'll be made slaves.
AID00133349	Hah! The Great Khans will not be slaves. Caesar himself has promised us the land from here to the Colorado and the freedom to raid as we see fit.
AID00133350	Caesar is only using you, he doesn't actually care about the Great Khans.
AID00133351	Doesn't he? Caesar's representative tells a different tale.
AID00133352	The glory of the Great Khans will be restored, and once the NCR is pushed back to California, all the land from here to the Colorado will be ours.
AID00133353	I won't hear any more talk against Caesar or his alliance. The Great Khans will answer Caesar's call to war, and the NCR will pay for their crimes.
AID00133354	No more questions.
AID00133355	If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
AID00133356	I've made my preparations. Let's get started.
AID00133357	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Let's get some rest and we'll have a brief talk first thing in the morning.
AID00133358	Sounds good.
AID00133359	Well I'm glad I have your approval.
AID00133360	I have access, right?
AID00133361	Not a chance. Only the necessary personnel have authorization.
AID00133362	I'm going to need access everywhere.
AID00133363	Alright, I'll give you full access.
AID00133364	I'm done with questions.
AID00133365	If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
AID00133366	Let's get this show on the road.
AID00133367	President Kimball is arriving shortly. If you want to do any last minute security sweeps or take a look around for anything suspicious, do it now.
AID00133368	Once you're ready, meet me outside on the observation deck, but don't take too long.
AID00133369	So what's the plan for today?
AID00133370	The plan is to get through today without the shit hitting the fan.
AID00133371	So I'll be overseeing the security team personally and keeping in constant contact with people over the radio.
AID00133372	It's a good bet that the Legion is going to try something today so we have to be prepared for anything.
AID00133373	We'll do whatever it takes to get the President through this visit in one piece.
AID00133374	What can I do to help?
AID00133375	Someone like you... I'm just glad to have you on board. Do whatever you can. Security sweeps, talk to people, keep an eye out.
AID00133376	Keep an eye on the crowd and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Other than that, just stay out of the way.
AID00133377	Do you have any leads on possible security threats?
AID00133378	The Legion will definitely try something, but we don't have any solid leads yet.
AID00133379	I'd almost expect something direct from them, but given the circumstances there's a possibility of something more subtle like sabotage.
AID00133380	But since we don't have anything solid we'll just have to keep our eyes out for anything out of the ordinary.
AID00133381	Possible security threats... there was a new guy allowed to help with security at the last minute. Other than that, we don't have any solid leads.
AID00133382	Do you have a detailed schedule for the visit?
AID00133383	I have a full itinerary here. Here you go.
AID00133384	The President arrives, gives a speech, and then leaves. That's all someone like you needs to know.
AID00133385	What are your security arrangements?
AID00133386	Security detail consists of rangers stationed here at the dam. Some will keep an eye on the crowd while others will watch the perimeter.
AID00133387	Snipers and sharpshooters have been assigned to key locations and we also have a special K9 unit sniffing out members of the crowd.
AID00133388	I've also locked down access to critical locations such as the landing platform on the visitor center.
AID00133389	Can I use my weapons during the President's visit?
AID00133390	We trust you, so you're free to have your weapons. Just don't do anything too crazy and we'll back you up.
AID00133391	You'll be allowed to carry your weapons, but they must remain holstered.
AID00133392	If you pull them out, my men will shoot you. Understand?
AID00133393	<Ranger Graham Morning Conversation>
AID00133394	Glad you could join us. Most of my men are already on duty and the crowd has already started gathering outside.
AID00133395	We've got a busy day ahead of us.
AID00133396	I have some questions.
AID00133397	Ask your questions, but keep it short.
AID00133398	I need to prepare first.
AID00133399	Make it quick.
AID00133400	I'm all set.
AID00133401	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Get some rest, I'll brief you in the morning.
AID00133402	Can I ask you about your dog tag first?
AID00133403	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133404	Sure.
AID00133405	There's an NCR soldier who wants me to kill you for it.
AID00133406	Can I have it?
AID00133407	Before I take care of them, can I ask you about your dog tag?
AID00133408	What do you want to know?
AID00133409	Actually, I want to talk about something else.
AID00133410	Sure.
AID00133411	[Attack] You're a rabid dog that needs to be put down.
AID00133412	I'll kill you for that!
AID00133413	He thinks you're suffering.
AID00133414	Suffering? I may be suffering but I still want to live. You tell that bastard that I have every intention of doing so.
AID00133415	Give me your dog tag, now!
AID00133416	[FAILED] Bullying me won't make me give it to you.
AID00133417	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here. Take it. Just leave me alone.
AID00133418	You define who you are, not some dog tag.
AID00133419	[FAILED] Sorry, I'm not giving it to you.
AID00133420	[SUCCEEDED] You're probably right. Here, take it.
AID00133421	Your humanity is a part of you, not kept in some dog tag.
AID00133422	On second thought, let me ask you something else.
AID00133423	Alright.
AID00133424	What's the history of the camp?
AID00133425	I know that this place was originally a mining town before the NCR took it over.  I think they mined gold before the war.
AID00133426	Sorry I don't know much more than that.
AID00133427	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
AID00133428	<Lie> Oh yeah, I'm sure he'd love to see you.
AID00133429	[FAILED] I'm still not so sure about that.
AID00133430	[SUCCEEDED] Guess it can't hurt to say hello.
AID00133431	Astor has agreed to let you join him.
AID00133432	Maybe now I can get my old life back, or at least most of it.
AID00133433	It's not much, but I want you to have this. Thanks for your help.
AID00133434	You were with the Enclave?
AID00133435	Yes, but the leadership and I didn't see eye to eye, so I left. It was the right decision, since the Enclave's oil rig was destroyed not long after.
AID00133436	Canine neuroscience?
AID00133437	Cyber-dogs and the like. It's not a field I work in much anymore.
AID00133438	You're a scientist?
AID00133439	Yes. Specializing in neuroscience, both human and canine. Of course, this lab is nothing compared to what I had when I was with the Enclave.
AID00133440	[Speech]
AID00133441	[SUCCEEDED] And you think the value of their attack on HELIOS, the chaos it will sow behind the Profligates' lines, is worth letting them live.
AID00133442	All right, let it be so. The Brotherhood will have to be dealt with eventually, but for the moment, they live to serve.
AID00133443	When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood will attack HELIOS One.
AID00133444	[FAILED] And you think they'll stop at that? How long before they attack the dam, or Vegas?
AID00133445	The risks outweigh the rewards. Go back to their bunker and finish the job.
AID00133446	When we attack the dam the Brotherhood will rise from their bunker to conquer HELIOS One!
AID00133447	I'll handle the Boomers for you.
AID00133448	Good. Your first challenge will be to reach their settlement without getting blown up. After that, should be easy.
AID00133449	I've already reverted the White Glove Society back to cannibalism.
AID00133450	All right, that's a start. But now you have to convince them to support my Legion.
AID00133451	Tell them they'll be allowed to continue practicing their dietary habits without interruption. They can eat a portion of what they conquer.
AID00133452	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133453	Do you have any dealings with New Vegas?
AID00133454	Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been in there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
AID00133455	Amazes me people would come from all over the wastes to throw away everything they've got in that town.
AID00133456	Anything else can you tell me about the NCR?
AID00133457	Seen them grow from a single town - Shady Sands - into the republic. They've done good for the most part.
AID00133458	What makes the NCR too ambitious?
AID00133459	They expand, fast. If you've got land they want, they'll take it, eventually. Did it out West, they'll do it here.
AID00133460	They keep rolling over people, they'll regret it. That's how revolutions start.
AID00133461	What do you know about the Legion?
AID00133462	Caesar thinks he can change human nature. Most of the Legion is following Caesar, not Caesar's ideals. When he's gone, it'll crumble.
AID00133463	Might not happen overnight. Might take a few decades. But it'll happen. Basic human nature - greed, ambition, jealousy - will see to it.
AID00133464	Why do some of the Super Mutants here dislike the NCR?
AID00133465	Lot of bad blood between Super Mutants and humans. Goes back years. Some here still got the scars and memories.
AID00133466	Me, I don't really have a problem with the NCR. Set their sights a little too high sometimes, but they try. Legion, that's another story.
AID00133467	All right, all right, don't get touchy. Just stick around for a while. I might change your mind.
AID00133468	We'll remain until the camp is packed up. If you have some plan, see to it quickly.
AID00133469	Just asking. Good luck on your migration.
AID00133470	So if you were in charge of the tribe, you'd fight with the NCR against Caesar if asked?
AID00133471	I suppose if asked, I would. But that's a moot point, because Papa's in charge now, and he's not going anywhere.
AID00133472	Interesting opinion, Karl. I wonder what Papa Khan will say about this.
AID00133473	You motherless bastard. You'll pay for this!
AID00133474	Because you know they'd come up lacking?
AID00133475	[SUCCEEDED] Enough! How dare you compare Caesar's finest to this tribe of savages? The mightiest Great Khan is scarcely a match for a Legion recruit!
AID00133476	The Burned Man would leave their mightiest shitting themselves in terror! I would... Uhhh, that is....
AID00133477	[FAILED] Win? I wasn't aware we were competing.
AID00133478	Well-spoken. You win this round.
AID00133479	But surely a warrior in service of glorious Caesar is the equal of any tribe's finest?
AID00133480	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I am! That is to say, Caesar has many fine warriors, and I wouldn't wish to compare them to the Great Khans.
AID00133481	[FAILED] You insult our hosts, where I wouldn't dare to. You might want to watch that talk around Papa Khan.
AID00133482	Wow, you're not worthy to join a scruffy tribe of has-been desert raiders? You must suck.
AID00133483	Not while there are still spines un-shattered.
AID00133484	Oh God help us!
AID00133485	Not really, no. Let's do this.
AID00133486	Ave Caesar!
AID00133487	Oh good, I've been needing a new head for my trophy spike.
AID00133488	Aieee!
AID00133489	If you think you can take me, then.
AID00133490	I hope you'll be a half-decent challenge.
AID00133491	What? Wait, can't we talk about this?
AID00133492	I'm afraid not. Our instructions were very specific. You have to die.
AID00133493	Send your whole damned Legion if you want - I'll water the desert with their blood.
AID00133494	Noooooooo!
AID00133495	Let's get this over with then.
AID00133496	Well-spoken.
AID00133497	RRCLegionAmbush
AID00133498	Karl sends his regards.
AID00133499	You don't give up, do you?
AID00133500	You've been a persistent annoyance. I had hoped to avoid this, but it seems I have no choice but to deal with you myself.
AID00133501	Any idea what our chances are?
AID00133502	Their men take comfort in - and rely on - killing at a distance. They will not have the luxury of such comforts this time.
AID00133503	Our warriors will wash over them in a tide of blood, severing arms before they can attack, legs before they can run, and heads before they can pray.
AID00133504	So yes, fortune favors our chances, messenger. Provided *you* move quickly.
AID00133505	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00133506	They are passable foes. Like their citizens, they prefer their war from a distance, and at that, they excel.
AID00133507	Their leaders have on occasion shown brilliance, their rangers in particular have adapted well to our strategies.
AID00133508	But their rangers are few, and this General Oliver we face is not their best. I regret not being able to face Hanlon, the one who led them last time.
AID00133509	Are you looking forward to the battle?
AID00133510	I live to serve Caesar's will - and the will of the Legion. If my victory serves them both, then I am pleased.
AID00133511	I wanted to know more about you.
AID00133512	What does Lanius mean?
AID00133513	The word means "butcher" in Latin. I was granted the name after proving myself in several battles.
AID00133514	Perhaps after today's battle, you too will earn yourself a new name.
AID00133515	And what do you want me to do?
AID00133516	Our forces are better equipped to take objectives than hold them. I do not wish to defend this place if another option exists.
AID00133517	Our opponents follow a strict chain of command, which is both a strength and weakness. I intend to use you to strike at that weakness.
AID00133518	Find the enemy commander, this General Oliver. Kill him or his resolve. Do this, and his cowards will retreat, leaving the dam to us.
AID00133519	You're the Legate, I'm guessing?
AID00133520	I am the commander of this army. The Son of Mars has granted me the name Lanius. And the time to serve him has come once more.
AID00133521	You mean your army is about to attack?
AID00133522	My army has been ready for some time now. My orders were to await the coming of a messenger.
AID00133523	You are messenger and message both, it would seem.
AID00133524	You should just go kill him.
AID00133525	[FAILED] I may be angry, but I'm not stupid.
AID00133526	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, I should.
AID00133527	Just get out of the way.
AID00133528	No, radio it in first.
AID00133529	Fuck it, you're more trouble than you're worth.
AID00133530	Okay, but let's make it quick.
AID00133531	Let's radio it in first.
AID00133532	Uh... I think I should check it out first before radioing it in.
AID00133533	Is it okay to leave your post?
AID00133534	We're just going to be a moment. We should both take a look first.
AID00133535	Let's go!
AID00133536	Okay, lead the way!
AID00133537	I need you to radio in an emergency report!
AID00133538	Settle down. No one uses the radio until I know what's going on.
AID00133539	There's a dead ranger downstairs!
AID00133540	Oh shit... really? We should go take a look!
AID00133541	Maybe I should go get the MPs.
AID00133542	Bad idea.
AID00133543	Die, infidel!
AID00133544	Why don't we take this somewhere private?
AID00133545	I don't have time for this.
AID00133546	Death to the Legion's enemies!
AID00133547	My mistake.
AID00133548	Yeah, thought so.
AID00133549	Just come with me, right now.
AID00133550	Sorry, that just ain't gonna happen.
AID00133551	For Caesar!
AID00133552	Would you happen to know who did maintenance on the President's vertibird?
AID00133553	You will regret this.
AID00133554	Die, Profligate!
AID00133555	I found this detonator in your pocket.
AID00133556	What the... how'd you...
AID00133557	 For the Legion!
AID00133558	Goodbye.
AID00133559	No problem.
AID00133560	Then leave me alone.
AID00133561	My dog here doesn't like you.
AID00133562	Well that's too bad. I'm just here to enjoy the show so if you don't mind...
AID00133563	You're the problem here.
AID00133564	I'm not sure what you mean. I think you have me confused with someone else.
AID00133565	<Raise arms>Boogedy boogedy boo!
AID00133566	Ahhh!...
AID00133567	You sick bastard, I could have shot you! You must be the backup I've been calling for.
AID00133568	Where are the rest of your men?
AID00133569	Goodbye.
AID00133570	Enjoy your stay at The Tops.
AID00133571	Legion money, please.
AID00133572	Very well. Will there be anything else?
AID00133573	Pay me in NCR money.
AID00133574	Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
AID00133575	I'll take my payout in caps.
AID00133576	Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
AID00133577	40 chips for $100 NCR.
AID00133578	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133579	8 chips for $20 NCR.
AID00133580	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133581	2 chips for $5 NCR.
AID00133582	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133583	I'd like to turn in my chips.
AID00133584	In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
AID00133585	I'd like to exchange NCR money for chips.
AID00133586	How many chips would you like?
AID00133587	80 chips for 20 Legion Denarii.
AID00133588	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133589	40 chips for 10 Legion Denarii.
AID00133590	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133591	20 chips for 5 Legion Denarii.
AID00133592	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133593	100 chips for 1 Legion Aureus or 25 Legion Denarii.
AID00133594	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133595	4 chips for 1 Legion Denarius.
AID00133596	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00133597	I'd like to exchange Legion money for chips.
AID00133598	How many chips would you like?
AID00133599	I could look for the source of the Nightstalker mutation for you.
AID00133600	Thank you. I strongly suspect that the source of the mutation is artificial, but the Super Mutants found nothing. Your fresh eyes may do better.
AID00133601	Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
AID00133602	What are you working on?
AID00133603	The Nightkin have varying degrees of mental instability due their addiction to Stealth Boy use. I've been trying to come up with a cure.
AID00133604	I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
AID00133605	I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
AID00133606	I'm surprised to find another human here.
AID00133607	I prefer the solitude, and having a bunch of Super Mutants around tends to keep things safe and quiet.
AID00133608	Hold off for now.
AID00133609	All right, if you want.
AID00133610	I got a brain from Lupa, the mother of many Legion Mongrels.
AID00133611	Rex will be tougher.
AID00133612	I took down a Fiend dog named Violetta.
AID00133613	Rex will be faster.
AID00133614	This brain is from Rey, one of Old Lady Gibson's dogs.
AID00133615	Let's see... good guard dog tendencies. If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
AID00133616	You're not getting the Mark II specs.
AID00133617	I knew humans could never be reasonable! I knew it! Stupid, stupid humans! I'll kill you!
AID00133618	Doctor Henry, do as he asks.
AID00133619	Good, good. Smart move, human.
AID00133620	The Mark IIs are even more dangerous than standard Stealth Boys.
AID00133621	Our lives, our decision to make. We're tired of sitting around in Jacobstown waiting for a cure.
AID00133622	What are you planning to do once you have the specs?
AID00133623	There are caches of Stealth Boys out there. With the Mark II in hand, it shouldn't be difficult to upgrade every one of them.
AID00133624	< Speech 80 >
AID00133625	[SUCCEEDED] No, I didn't, not until now anyway. Very well, human. You've made your point, and I withdraw my... request.
AID00133626	What you do in the wasteland affects all the mutants here, but you didn't think about that, did you?
AID00133627	[FAILED] No more negotiating, and definitely no more waiting. This is your last chance before we take it by force.
AID00133628	Doctor Henry doesn't have the cure just yet, but he's almost there. Be patient.
AID00133629	< Speech 80 >
AID00133630	I had some questions about Jacobstown.
AID00133631	Such as?
AID00133632	What's the story with Keene?
AID00133633	Smart, charismatic. Hell of a mean streak. Doesn't care for humans. Prefers fighting them to talking.
AID00133634	He's got a lot of pull with Nightkin, though. He talks, they listen. Was hoping he could draw other Nightkin to Jacobstown.
AID00133635	Keene is saner than most, but I know he's thinking of going his own way again. He's aggressive, impatient. Can't stand sitting around.
AID00133636	<Ambush Dialog>
AID00133637	It's your own fault for finding this - now I'm going to have to kill you.
AID00133638	vFreeformCampGuardianBattleDone
AID00133639	Ha! How do you like that you sons of bitches?!
AID00133640	What do you do here?
AID00133641	I represent the Nightkin. Marcus may lead this town, but the Nightkin listen to what I have to say.
AID00133642	That doesn't mean I don't respect Marcus for what he's trying to do. However, he doesn't truly understand the difficulties of being a Nightkin.
AID00133643	Who's the other human you mentioned?
AID00133644	Doctor Henry. He's one of you - go speak with him instead of me.
AID00133645	What great legacy do the Great Khans have? Your tribe is nothing but ghosts and martyrs.
AID00133646	[SUCCEEDED] I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
AID00133647	If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
AID00133648	Time to go pay General Oliver a visit.
AID00133649	Mars's eyes are upon you. Do not fail him - or us.
AID00133650	Then let's go.
AID00133651	I have questions.
AID00133652	Then ask them. But don't waste my time. The battle draws near.
AID00133653	What can you tell me about the layout of the dam?
AID00133654	It was not intended for war - its top sides are bound to two intake towers by a series of bridges. No doubt snipers nest there.
AID00133655	On the far side of the dam, a small building provides access to the power plant below. That is where Oliver hides.
AID00133656	I'm ready. What is the plan?
AID00133657	In the past, the NCR has relied upon attrition, withering our numbers with ranged fire and falling back as necessary.
AID00133658	Not this time. The dam contains tunnels to its heart, overlooked by the NCR... now occupied by the Legion.
AID00133659	When the battle begins, the NCR will find our teeth at their throats in a dozen places. There will be no attrition, no falling back, only carnage.
AID00133660	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133661	Sure.
AID00133662	Can I ask you something else?
AID00133663	Sure.
AID00133664	I've got a package here from your friends Jack and Diane.
AID00133665	Huh? Oh! Oh, right. Yeah. I'll take that. You should go now, before you draw any attention.
AID00133666	I've got a package here from your friends Jack and Diane.
AID00133667	About goddamn time. Tell the Khans if they can't keep a steady supply, we'll find someone who can.
AID00133668	Sounds too dangerous, I'll pass.
AID00133669	Piece of cake.
AID00133670	Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
AID00133671	Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
AID00133672	Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
AID00133673	Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
AID00133674	I'm not interested in being a drug mule.
AID00133675	Sure, I'll do it.
AID00133676	Great. Here's the package - your contact is Don Hostetler at the Crimson Caravan. Come back and see me when you're done.
AID00133677	VMS46NullLinks
AID00133678	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
AID00133679	Groodalicious. That ought to rake in the caps. What do I owe you?
AID00133680	On second thought, never mind.
AID00133681	Sure, what have you got?
AID00133682	With Anders out of commission for so long, we're shorthanded on runners, and some backlogs have piled up.
AID00133683	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
AID00133684	You up for something challenging?
AID00133685	I've got a shipment of Jet and Psycho that needs to be delivered to Motor Runner at Vault 3.
AID00133686	Okay, I'll be back as soon as I have any news.
AID00133687	Thanks. Prove you're reliable on this, and I'll have more for you later.
AID00133688	Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'll pass.
AID00133689	Okay then. Job'll be waiting if you change your mind.
AID00133690	Sure, just tell me who I'm looking for and where to start.
AID00133691	About three weeks ago I sent Anders southeast to find a route into Arizona to open new markets for our product.
AID00133692	He should have been back two days ago, but there's been no sign of him.
AID00133693	You've got an impressive setup here - have you considered making more helpful chems?
AID00133694	Already on it. I whipped up a few Stimpaks already, but if you've got any more recipes I'll take them.
AID00133695	How's the medical work going?
AID00133696	What do you mean, helpful? My stuff already makes people feel groodalicious.
AID00133697	Yeah, you made a pretty good argument. We'll keep it small for now, but if it turns a profit we might expand.
AID00133698	Have you started making meds yet?
AID00133699	Helpful? What, like bathtub Stimpaks? What's the point of that?
AID00133700	What do you have for sale?
AID00133701	Oh, you're buying? Cool.
AID00133702	Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
AID00133703	Jack handles the small-time purchases. You should talk to him unless you're looking for a major shipment.
AID00133704	I know a few recipes for chems you might want. I could teach you.
AID00133705	Right on. What have you got?
AID00133706	I'm looking to make a few caps. Got any work for me?
AID00133707	I don't have any compelling reason to trust you, given your behavior. So no, I'm not really inclined to give you a job.
AID00133708	Hmm... you look like you could handle yourself in a fix. All right, I'll tell you what. Anders, one of my best runners, is overdue to report back.
AID00133709	If you can find out what happened to him, I'll give you some real work.
AID00133710	Great! Here's your payment.
AID00133711	I finished the Crimson Caravan run.
AID00133712	And you didn't even get skinned alive. I'm impressed. Here's your payment.
AID00133713	I finished the Vault 3 run.
AID00133714	Like I said, find Anders first, then we'll see about trusting you with more work.
AID00133715	Any new jobs for me?
AID00133716	Yeah, you did good finding him. Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
AID00133717	Now that Anders is back, how about that work?
AID00133718	Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
AID00133719	Any new jobs for me?
AID00133720	Not right at the moment, but you could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
AID00133721	Any new jobs for me?
AID00133722	Ordinarily I would, but it seems like all our clients have ended up dead. You could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
AID00133723	Any new jobs for me?
AID00133724	Diane handles most of the transactional elements of this little enterprise, but I'm always in the market for new recipes if you've got the spark.
AID00133725	Are there any town rules I need to know about?
AID00133726	Same as any civilized town - don't start any fights or steal anything, we'll treat you fair. Not a lot to ask.
AID00133727	What's wrong with the Nightkin?
AID00133728	Nightkin suffer schizophrenia from the Stealth Boys they're always using. One of the reasons I settled Jacobstown was so they could be cured.
AID00133729	While they're in town, the Nightkin aren't allowed to have Stealth Boys so their craziness doesn't get worse.
AID00133730	Trouble is the Nightkin don't like being visible, either. They don't take being exposed too well.
AID00133731	I need something repaired.
AID00133732	Let me take a look.
AID00133733	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00133734	All right.
AID00133735	Why the hostility?
AID00133736	Look, I don't need your shit. Either get out of the way or things are gonna get rough.
AID00133737	I'm hunting ghouls.
AID00133738	Then why are you in here bothering me instead of out there hunting them?
AID00133739	Nothing, I'm just passing through.
AID00133740	You must be crazy if you're just "passing through" this place.
AID00133741	Goodbye.
AID00133742	Yeah, whatever.
AID00133743	Not really.
AID00133744	That's okay, I wouldn't expect anybody to. I think they tend to keep to themselves.
AID00133745	Yeah. I know to shoot them on sight.
AID00133746	That bad, huh? Guess I'm lucky I got away with my life. I'll make sure and avoid them from now on. Thanks.
AID00133747	I know who they are but I don't care about their agenda.
AID00133748	Yeah, it's pretty far out, right? Fixating on old technology just doesn't seem very relevant to most people's lives.
AID00133749	They've got the right idea.
AID00133750	Do they? That's a relief. I wasn't so sure, myself. Protecting people from technology seems like a big job for such a small group.
AID00133751	They're enemies of the NCR. If you know where they are you should turn them in.
AID00133752	Oh my gosh, really? Well, I didn't see where they went, but I'll keep an eye out. Wow, I had no idea they were so dangerous.
AID00133753	Thanks for letting me know. Glad I didn't do any business with them.
AID00133754	They're usually harmless unless you use advanced technology around them.
AID00133755	Well that shouldn't be a problem for me. I can't afford anything like that.
AID00133756	I met a group of them in a bunker west of here.
AID00133757	And?
AID00133758	What did you want to ask me earlier?
AID00133759	Some other time, maybe.
AID00133760	Sure. It's a small wasteland. I'm sure we'll run into each other again.
AID00133761	I'd rather you didn't.
AID00133762	Forget I said anything, then.
AID00133763	Go ahead.
AID00133764	I had a run-in with this group calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel. Pretty strange bunch. Do you know anything about them?
AID00133765	So you just leave your family in the bunker?
AID00133766	Yeah. I'm not worried. They can handle themselves. But somebody has to get the groceries, know what I mean?
AID00133767	And actually these days I think they'd rather have me out here anyway. But that's a whole other story.
AID00133768	So, listen, can I ask you something on the level?
AID00133769	You live in a hole in the ground?
AID00133770	Well, a bunker, if you want to get technical. I think it sounds more interesting my way.
AID00133771	But I'm not there much anymore. I'm usually out here picking up food and supplies for my family. Whatever they need.
AID00133772	None of your business.
AID00133773	That's why I asked. My business is boring. You try trading and scavenging for a living and see if you don't start nosing into other people's affairs.
AID00133774	I'm not entirely sure.
AID00133775	Yeah, guess the roads must've been long, then, if you forgot where you started from.
AID00133776	The grave.
AID00133777	Huh. Well, in that case I take it back. You look pretty good, given the circumstances.
AID00133778	Goodsprings.
AID00133779	Wow, you have come a long way, then. I've never been there, but I've met some traders who pass that way.
AID00133780	Well, welcome, then. I'm Veronica. I live in a hole in the ground.
AID00133781	Anything I can do to help around here?
AID00133782	More than you already have? Might want to ask around, but truth is, you've already helped out a lot in the short time you've been here.
AID00133783	I suppose you could talk to Ghost, up on top of the barracks - uh, Ranger Ghost. Something about trouble in Nipton, maybe.
AID00133784	Help? Oh, well... you could speak to Ranger Jackson. He might have something for you.
AID00133785	He sort of runs things around here, mostly ends up sending reports back West that aren't filled with the best news.
AID00133786	I need repairs.
AID00133787	All right then... just sign here, here, and... here.
AID00133788	Goodbye.
AID00133789	May I ask you a few questions first?
AID00133790	Goodbye.
AID00133791	Goodbye.
AID00133792	Goodbye.
AID00133793	Goodbye.
AID00133794	Sure, I'll go talk to them.
AID00133795	Thank you. We'll wait here until we hear from you.
AID00133796	You're right, it is.
AID00133797	You're doing the right thing.
AID00133798	Thank you. I think I just needed to hear someone else say it. I suppose without rule of law, we're no better than raiders.
AID00133799	Have you considered joining the Great Khans?
AID00133800	[FAILED] No, this needs to end. I'm tired of running and living like scavengers.
AID00133801	[SUCCEEDED] I hadn't thought of that. Would you be willing to talk to them on our behalf?
AID00133802	Goodbye.
AID00133803	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133804	Why do you want to surrender?
AID00133805	We can't survive like this - there are too many of us and we don't have the resources. And maybe it's the right thing to do.
AID00133806	Goodbye.
AID00133807	I'm still working on it.  May I ask you some questions?
AID00133808	The Khans will accept you as long as you pass the initiation rite.
AID00133809	Well, that's a hell of a lot better than going back to prison.
AID00133810	Goodbye.
AID00133811	I'm working on it, but I had some questions.
AID00133812	Yes.
AID00133813	Good to hear. Without access to the sulfur, Cooke doesn't have much to offer the gang. I... I guess it's over, then. We can turn ourselves in.
AID00133814	Goodbye.
AID00133815	Goodbye.
AID00133816	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133817	Goodbye.
AID00133818	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133819	Why can't you seal off the sulfur yourself?
AID00133820	Yes.
AID00133821	Why do you want to seal off the sulfur?
AID00133822	Yes.
AID00133823	Goodbye.
AID00133824	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133825	Why would you want to do that?
AID00133826	Cooke is planning to use the sulfur to make bigger explosives.
AID00133827	Will you check out the caves and see if there's anything you can do?
AID00133828	Without access to the sulfur, he'll lose what influence he has left with the men here.
AID00133829	I'll do it.
AID00133830	Thanks. Take this keycard - I tried hacking the locking mechanisms on the doors, but it seems that the only way in is with one of these.
AID00133831	Why can't you do it?
AID00133832	I have to watch Cooke. I wouldn't put it past him to just start killing the opposition, starting with me.
AID00133833	Goodbye.
AID00133834	Not right now, may I ask you some questions?
AID00133835	Sure, what do you need done?
AID00133836	Goodbye.
AID00133837	I'm still working on it, may I ask you some questions?
AID00133838	Yes. You can join then, but he says you would all still have to pass the initiation rite.
AID00133839	I'd rather not, but fair enough. We'll do it.
AID00133840	Goodbye.
AID00133841	I'm working on it, may I ask you some questions?
AID00133842	Yes.
AID00133843	Good. Hey, I got another job for you if you're interested.
AID00133844	Goodbye.
AID00133845	May I ask you some questions?
AID00133846	Goodbye.
AID00133847	I'm just another wastelander looking for work.
AID00133848	What's got you so worked up?
AID00133849	Goodbye.
AID00133850	May I ask you some questions?
AID00133851	Got any work?
AID00133852	What's going on around here?
AID00133853	Goodbye.
AID00133854	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133855	Goodbye.
AID00133856	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133857	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
AID00133858	Tell me about the super mutants.
AID00133859	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
AID00133860	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00133861	Goodbye.
AID00133862	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133863	Tell me about the Great Khans.
AID00133864	Tell me about the super mutants.
AID00133865	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
AID00133866	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00133867	Goodbye.
AID00133868	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133869	Tell me about the Great Khans.
AID00133870	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
AID00133871	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
AID00133872	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00133873	Goodbye.
AID00133874	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133875	Goodbye.
AID00133876	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133877	Tell me about the Great Khans.
AID00133878	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
AID00133879	Tell me about the super mutants.
AID00133880	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00133881	Tell me about the Great Khans?
AID00133882	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
AID00133883	Tell me about the super mutants.
AID00133884	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
AID00133885	Goodbye.
AID00133886	Goodbye.
AID00133887	Goodbye.
AID00133888	Goodbye.
AID00133889	Goodbye.
AID00133890	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133891	How did you get out?
AID00133892	Goodbye.
AID00133893	Goodbye.
AID00133894	Goodbye.
AID00133895	Goodbye.
AID00133896	Goodbye.
AID00133897	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133898	Goodbye.
AID00133899	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133900	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133901	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133902	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133903	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133904	Tell me about the problems with Lem.
AID00133905	Why do you hate the NCR so much anyway?
AID00133906	Tell me about the super mutants.
AID00133907	I've heard the muties there are different. Completely insane, and supposedly they use some kind of invisibility technology. I'd stay away.
AID00133908	Why's the area so dangerous?
AID00133909	Tell me about the Great Khans.
AID00133910	They've been through some rough times, but they can hold their own. I wouldn't mind taking the boys and signing up with them, if it weren't for Lem.
AID00133911	Tell me about McCarran.
AID00133912	It's the main base for the NCR, and a breeding ground for oppression in the name of patriotic bullshit. Do humanity a favor and blow it up.
AID00133913	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
AID00133914	The NCR's been mining there for awhile, but now it's full of Deathclaws. Don't go there unless you want a quick, bloody death.
AID00133915	Tell me about the Fiends.
AID00133916	Like raiders, but worse - these guys are messed up on every damn chem there is. You can spot them by the horned skulls they wear as hats.
AID00133917	Goodbye.
AID00133918	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133919	Goodbye.
AID00133920	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133921	Goodbye.
AID00133922	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133923	Tell me about the area outside the vault.
AID00133924	It's a fucking deathtrap around here. Fiends swarm all over Vault 3 in the east, and there are fucking Deathclaws south of that, at Quarry Junction.
AID00133925	If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us and an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
AID00133926	So, what brought you to this place?
AID00133927	Heard there was an abandoned vault along this mountain ridge, and that the wildlife here had teeth big enough to keep the NCR away.
AID00133928	What do you need the sulfur for?
AID00133929	Why can't you do it?
AID00133930	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133931	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133932	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133933	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133934	Goodbye.
AID00133935	Let's talk about something else.
AID00133936	Yes.
AID00133937	I'll do it.
AID00133938	Great. Get to it. Oh, and take this - there's some weird shit with this Vault's security and some doors will only open if you have a keycard.
AID00133939	I'll do it.
AID00133940	Great. Come back as soon as you can.
AID00133941	Why do you want to join the Great Khans?
AID00133942	There aren't enough of us here to make a real impact on the NCR, and the Khans probably hate the NCR more than we do. Strength in numbers, they say.
AID00133943	So, will you talk to Papa Khan on our behalf?
AID00133944	Yes.
AID00133945	Yes.
AID00133946	What do you want the sulfur for?
AID00133947	Explosives. Bombs. Big, big fucking bombs. You gonna help us or not?
AID00133948	Why can't you do it?
AID00133949	I have to keep an eye on that bastard Lem. The second I turn my back, he might go crying to the NCR.
AID00133950	So, what do you say? You going to take care of those geckos?
AID00133951	Why did you kill Lem?
AID00133952	Didn't have a choice. He was confusing the men, and I need to control them or we're just a bunch of disorganized idiots.
AID00133953	Why do you hate the NCR?
AID00133954	Tell me about the prison break.
AID00133955	A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the  NCR.
AID00133956	How did you end up in prison?
AID00133957	I was blowing up supply caravans along the 15 freeway. The NCR got wise to my ambush spots, picked me up and threw me in a cage.
AID00133958	Who's Lem?
AID00133959	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He was useful during the jailbreak, but now...
AID00133960	He's just another coward. He wants us to leave the vault and hand our asses to the NCR, as if they'd treat us like human beings.
AID00133961	Tell me about Lem.
AID00133962	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He had his uses, but he's a coward and a troublemaker.
AID00133963	Got any work?
AID00133964	Tell me about NCR.
AID00133965	Their "republic" is a joke. They're a bunch of tyrants led by an even greater tyrant, that idiot Kimball.
AID00133966	They think they have the right to annex every inch of dirt in the West and force their system on every man, woman, and child.
AID00133967	Who are you?
AID00133968	You really don't know? I'm Samuel Cooke. I was the brains behind the NCRCF prison break.
AID00133969	Do you know anything about this vault?
AID00133970	Some of the computers still work, but the only files are diaries and garbage. Typical vault.
AID00133971	What's going on here?
AID00133972	That coward Lem has been talking about surrendering to the NCR. Now the men are confused, not sure who's leading this gang. Fucking idiots.
AID00133973	Lem's been taken care of. We can start mining that sulfur now, thanks to you.
AID00133974	I'll take the recipe.
AID00133975	Here you go. Enjoy it.
AID00133976	I'll take the caps.
AID00133977	Here you go, you've earned these.
AID00133978	On second thought, nothing now.
AID00133979	Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133980	I can teach you to make Rocket.
AID00133981	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AID00133982	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133983	I was thinking Rocket, but now I'm not so sure.
AID00133984	I can teach you to make Party-Time Mentats.
AID00133985	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AID00133986	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133987	I was thinking Party-Time Mentats, but now I'm not so sure.
AID00133988	I can teach you to make Slasher.
AID00133989	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AID00133990	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133991	I was thinking Slasher, but now I'm not so sure.
AID00133992	I can teach you to make Hydra.
AID00133993	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AID00133994	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133995	I was thinking Hydra, but now I'm not so sure.
AID00133996	I can teach you to make Super Stimpaks.
AID00133997	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AID00133998	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AID00133999	I was thinking Super Stimpacks, but now I'm not so sure.
AID00134000	Medical supplies are always scarce, and they don't kill the buyer as often. Think of the profits!
AID00134001	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a point. Selling meds to the locals could be a pretty nice side gig. All right, I'll tell Jack to give it a try.
AID00134002	[FAILED] That's touching, but it would take away from our bottom line. I'll have to pass.
AID00134003	But you could turn a profit and help the people of the Mojave!
AID00134004	Okay, I'll do that.
AID00134005	Anything else?
AID00134006	But think of all the people who overdose on Jet and Psycho. It's bad for your karma.
AID00134007	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa... you're right. I should start a side project making meds to keep my aura clean.
AID00134008	[FAILED] I don't know what you've been smoking, but where can I get some?
AID00134009	If "groodalicious" means "dead," maybe. Think of the children, man! The *children!*
AID00134010	Thanks for letting me borrow your dog.
AID00134011	No problem. Glad I could help out.
AID00134012	I have other questions.
AID00134013	Make it quick.
AID00134014	Nevermind.
AID00134015	Okay. Anything else?
AID00134016	Come on, it's just a dog.
AID00134017	You know what? I think it's best if he stays with me.
AID00134018	It's okay, I'm good with animals.
AID00134019	Okay. Take good care of him and bring him back when you're done.
AID00134020	How do you get his coat so shiny?
AID00134021	I brush it every day. One hundred brushes.
AID00134022	Would you mind if I borrowed him to check out the area?
AID00134023	I don't think so. You already have a dog right there.
AID00134024	I don't know about that...
AID00134025	Can I ask what you're looking for?
AID00134026	Okay, I'm ready to go.
AID00134027	Yep, I'm ready to go.
AID00134028	It's about damn time.
AID00134029	Can I ask where we're going?
AID00134030	What do you hope to find?
AID00134031	Anything that's valuable. You done with the questions yet?
AID00134032	Where exactly are we going?
AID00134033	We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used the most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
AID00134034	I found the keys on one of the trooper corpses.
AID00134035	Can I ask you something before we go?
AID00134036	What?
AID00134037	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
AID00134038	Well hurry the fuck up, I don't wanna wait all day.
AID00134039	Yeah, I'm ready.
AID00134040	Good, we're going to the Police Station first. Here's the key, we'll follow you there.
AID00134041	And just so you know, I'm not leaving town until I get what I came for. If you decide to go wandering off somewhere else, don't expect me to follow.
AID00134042	Okay. I'll be back.
AID00134043	Just go already.
AID00134044	Fine, I'll do it.
AID00134045	Good, now get going.
AID00134046	I'd better get a bigger share for this.
AID00134047	[FAILED] Fuck you. You'll get the same as everyone else.
AID00134048	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, fine, but you gotta bring us those suits first.
AID00134049	I can do that.
AID00134050	Well then, get your ass out there.
AID00134051	I'll check it out.
AID00134052	Yeah you do that.
AID00134053	What are you looking for in the computer?
AID00134054	The location of some radiation suits. I found an inventory list that says they should be here but I can't seem to find them anywhere.
AID00134055	The computer should know what happened to them.
AID00134056	Goodbye.
AID00134057	Are you looking for something?
AID00134058	I could ask you the same thing.
AID00134059	Who is your employer?
AID00134060	Some caravan company, Crimson something or other. Some old broad said they're looking to expand their business, be more competitive or some shit.
AID00134061	I don't really care, so long as I get paid.
AID00134062	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
AID00134063	All I know is that the whole place is filled with radiation, there are nasty creatures roaming about.
AID00134064	And that my employer is paying me a pretty penny to loot it.
AID00134065	Maybe I can help?
AID00134066	Look if you really want to help either get the fuck out of our way or hack that damn computer over there.
AID00134067	What is this initiation?
AID00134068	Everybody has to do it. Well, everybody who wants to be a Khan, anyways. They toss you into the ring there and beat on you for a solid minute.
AID00134069	If you survive, you're in.
AID00134070	Goodbye.
AID00134071	I took care of those geckos.
AID00134072	You won't get a fucking cap from me, and you're lucky I don't blow your goddamn head off.
AID00134073	The whole point of killing the geckos was so we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
AID00134074	Goodbye.
AID00134075	May I ask you some questions?
AID00134076	Goodbye.
AID00134077	May I ask you some questions?
AID00134078	Goodbye.
AID00134079	I've come here looking for work.
AID00134080	What's going on around here?
AID00134081	Goodbye.
AID00134082	Goodbye.
AID00134083	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134084	Goodbye.
AID00134085	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134086	Goodbye.
AID00134087	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134088	Goodbye.
AID00134089	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134090	Goodbye.
AID00134091	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134092	Goodbye.
AID00134093	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134094	Goobye.
AID00134095	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134096	Goodbye.
AID00134097	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134098	Goodbye.
AID00134099	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134100	Goodbye.
AID00134101	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134102	Why don't you join the Great Khans?
AID00134103	Why do you want to surrender?
AID00134104	Why were you in prison?
AID00134105	Tell me about the prison break.
AID00134106	Who is Samuel Cooke?
AID00134107	Cooke organized the breakout. But he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
AID00134108	Who's Cooke?
AID00134109	Tell me about the prison break.
AID00134110	I can be pretty sneaky when I need to be, and the prison guards were a joke.
AID00134111	So when Cooke told me his plan, I spread the info to anyone that might be useful.
AID00134112	Who's Cooke?
AID00134113	Samuel Cooke. It was his idea to organize a jailbreak, but now he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
AID00134114	How did you get out?
AID00134115	Made it out during Cooke's big prison break, like the rest of the guys here.
AID00134116	What did you do?
AID00134117	I made my living sneaking into NCR camps looking for shit to steal. I got sloppy, and then I got caught.
AID00134118	Got any work?
AID00134119	Who are you?
AID00134120	I'm a nobody. Just a survivor. Things were well enough until the NCR threw me behind bars.
AID00134121	Tell me about Cooke.
AID00134122	Cooke is just an overambitious prick, and he's going to get us all killed.
AID00134123	What's going on here?
AID00134124	Fucking Cooke has us trapped here. After we escaped from an NCR prison, he dragged us around the wasteland until we ended up in this shit hole.
AID00134125	A group of us want to leave, go back to the NCR and surrender. But Cooke won't let us.
AID00134126	After you cut off access to the sulfur, Cooke left. I guess we're free to surrender to the NCR now.
AID00134127	We're waiting on you.  A lot of us are interested in joining the Khans.
AID00134128	Got any work?
AID00134129	What's going on around here?
AID00134130	Goodbye.
AID00134131	What if you joined the Great Khans?
AID00134132	You're doing the right thing.
AID00134133	Let's go.
AID00134134	I'm ready to travel with you.
AID00134135	Good. I hoped you'd come around. Shall we?
AID00134136	Don't you have a family to feed?
AID00134137	Like I said, they can handle themselves. And I'm not the only one getting supplies for them. It's a big family.
AID00134138	Not interested.
AID00134139	Suit yourself. You can always change your mind.
AID00134140	I'd like to, but I can't take you with me right now.
AID00134141	Aw, you really know how to make a girl feel like a stray cat.
AID00134142	But okay. My offer stands, if we run into each other again.
AID00134143	Okay, let's travel together.
AID00134144	Now you're talking. One thing you should know, first, though. I asked you about the Brotherhood because I'm one of them.
AID00134145	I know, I know. But I had to know how you'd react when I told you. We've made a lot of enemies.
AID00134146	You still okay bringing me along?
AID00134147	Where are you hoping to go?
AID00134148	Oh, nowhere in particular, really. Just hoping to see more of the world. Looking for a fresh perspective.
AID00134149	I want to see how different groups have adapted to survive in the Mojave. See if there's something I can learn from.
AID00134150	You don't look like much. What do you bring to the table?
AID00134151	Heh. Good. That's the look I was going for. Trust me on this one, though. You'll be glad you brought me along.
AID00134152	If I turn out to be a burden, we can part ways at any time. No hard feelings.
AID00134153	Going to see an old friend.
AID00134154	This is quite a journey you're going on, then. Must be an interesting relationship to have brought you all this way.
AID00134155	I go where I'm needed.
AID00134156	Guess we have that in common, then.
AID00134157	What's it to you?
AID00134158	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like he can really handle himself.
AID00134159	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like she can really handle herself.
AID00134160	There are places I've never been to that'd be too dangerous for just me. What do you think? Maybe we could travel together, help each other out.
AID00134161	I just kind of drift from place to place.
AID00134162	Just wherever the wind takes you, huh? I like that. Keeps things interesting.
AID00134163	Hoover Dam.
AID00134164	Huh. Just on your way to do a little heavily fortified sightseeing. Kind of a thrillseeker, aren't you?
AID00134165	The Strip.
AID00134166	Ooo. Very exciting. Gonna strike it rich, huh?
AID00134167	I don't really know anything about them.
AID00134168	I've heard they shoot lasers from their eyes.
AID00134169	Wow. I've got to admit, you have completely defied my first impression of you.
AID00134170	Eye lasers. I'll be sure and look out for that next time.
AID00134171	Any other juicy bits of intel?
AID00134172	I don't care for them.
AID00134173	Not very friendly, are they?
AID00134174	Well, thanks for weighing in. Gives me something to think about.
AID00134175	I'm reserving judgment.
AID00134176	That seems wise. I think I am, too. Although for how much longer, I'm not sure.
AID00134177	They seemed all right.
AID00134178	You think? Well good, then. That puts me a little more at ease.
AID00134179	Hey, so where are you headed, anyway?
AID00134180	I killed them all.
AID00134181	God, you're not lying, are you? You really did kill them.
AID00134182	In that case, this is for them.
AID00134183	Did you still want to help Doctor Henry run his experiment?
AID00134184	Of course, dearie. I know it's dangerous, but it'll all turn out for the best, you'll see. I'll go to him now - it would be rude to keep him waiting!
AID00134185	I need to think about this.
AID00134186	Once you're done thinking, talk to Lily.
AID00134187	Why is the Stealth Boy Mark II riskier?
AID00134188	The stealth field has been modulated to use less power and thus last longer, but for some reason it has pronounced negative effects on the user.
AID00134189	However, these pronounced effects will allow me to pinpoint exactly what parts of the brain they're affecting.
AID00134190	Unfortunately, I'll need to run the test on a live subject, and Marcus has encouraged me to investigate the Nightstalker mutation first.
AID00134191	What are the risks of the experiment?
AID00134192	Possibly immediate and permanent mental damage. There's a reason the Stealth Boy Mark IIs never got beyond the prototype stage.
AID00134193	Lily already has a pre-existing condition, and the experiment will likely make things worse for her.
AID00134194	I'll talk to Lily, then.
AID00134195	I'll be waiting.
AID00134196	Why Lily and not some other Nightkin?
AID00134197	Lily is eccentric, certainly, but I've never felt she was dangerous. More importantly, she asked if she could help me in some way.
AID00134198	I've told her about the risks, and she still insists on helping me.
AID00134199	I found a chewed up Stealth Boy in the Nightstalker lair.
AID00134200	Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
AID00134201	More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
AID00134202	There's only one avenue left for me - I need to run the Mark II test on Lily. It's the only way.
AID00134203	Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
AID00134204	More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
AID00134205	I did have a test in mind using Lily, but since she's dead, that's no longer a possibility. Regrettable. Anyway, you've done all you can.

AID00134212	He's got no resources but a decent cause. We've got plenty of resources and a totally lost cause.
AID00134213	No power armor. No energy weapons. And they're giving the NCR more trouble than we ever did.
AID00134214	Ordinary guys with knives and bullets, and they're taking over Nevada.
AID00134215	There's a lot more troops here than we thought. No wonder we couldn't hold HELIOS One.
AID00134216	A bunch of shut-ins who scorn outsiders and hold technology over them. Gee, where have I heard that one before?
AID00134217	Can't help but be impressed with what they're doing here.
AID00134218	Even the stupid NCR is investing in new research. We're getting left in the dust.
AID00134219	Leading his people to a new land with big dreams and a clean slate. Makes me think of my old mentor.
AID00134220	Holy hell, that's a lot of energy weapons. Guess we dropped the ball on that one.

AID00134225	Let's keep moving.
AID00134226	Let's.
AID00134227	Never mind.
AID00134228	Darn it, I had some spectacular answers coming, too.
AID00134229	Any thoughts about Caesar's Legion?
AID00134230	Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California, I'll say that. Where's that touch of Old World class?
AID00134231	Although I hear the soldiers mount each other as much as they mount their women, so maybe they did keep a little something from the Empire.
AID00134232	No such privilege for the women, though. Figures. So... to answer your question... they're a bunch of hypocritical jerkwads. It's a word.
AID00134233	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00134234	I'm worried they'll be the death of the Brotherhood. They take what they want. We defend our interests to the death.
AID00134235	But there's a handful of us and tens or hundreds of thousands of them. So it's not going to end well.
AID00134236	Last time we clashed we lost a lot of people. Retreated to our bunker. Now we're afraid to even move around during the day.
AID00134237	Know anything about New Vegas?
AID00134238	Yep. It's your typical city layout. Rich people in a gated community surrounded by extreme poverty.
AID00134239	House gave the area around the Strip to the locals, but he has no interest in it, so he ignores it entirely. It just needs new management.
AID00134240	I'd love to see the Brotherhood do it, but since the Codex doesn't say "clean up Freeside" no one listens to me. Bunch of sticklers.
AID00134241	Ever hear of a guy called Benny?
AID00134242	Sure, he's one of the hotel managers on the Strip. He comes up in the news now and then.
AID00134243	Him and the other Chairmen run the Tops. It's one of the nicer hotels, or so I hear.
AID00134244	Elder McNamara wouldn't shell out for a passport for me, so I've actually never been to the Strip. Why do people get so cheap when they get old?
AID00134245	Can you tell me anything about this platinum chip?
AID00134246	Yeah. It's not for poker.
AID00134247	I've never seen anything quite like it, but I can tell you it looks like it was fabricated before the War, and not at a mint.
AID00134248	Some kind of tech... I'm gonna say... mid-2200s. Hold onto it. Might be your lucky chip.
AID00134249	Ever heard of Mr. House before?
AID00134250	Yeah. They say he built the Strip. Of course, they say a lot of things. No one's actually met him.
AID00134251	Me? I think it's a hoax. Probably a group of people who want to avoid attention, or some made-up persona of a self-aware computer.
AID00134252	Why else would he shut himself in like that?
AID00134253	I have questions I wanted to ask you.
AID00134254	He was dead when I got there.
AID00134255	This better not be about the meaning of life.
AID00134256	Well, when two people really love each other... you really don't know this stuff yet?
AID00134257	Ooo, do I get a prize if I answer right?
AID00134258	I was told we wouldn't be tested on this.
AID00134259	A lifetime supply of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, revenge against my enemies, and world peace. In that order.
AID00134260	I was young and I needed the money.
AID00134261	It's a free wasteland.
AID00134262	Tell me about yourself.
AID00134263	I like long walks in the desert and candle-lit metal workshops.
AID00134264	My favorite subject.
AID00134265	Absolutely not. You misled me on purpose.
AID00134266	Yes, but you're on a short leash.
AID00134267	Fair enough. Maybe one day I'll have your complete trust, and I can be on a long leash. A girl can dream.
AID00134268	As long as you're honest with me from now on.
AID00134269	Sure. Just don't ever ask me if your outfit makes you look fat.
AID00134270	Actually, I'm more comfortable now that I know you've had some training.
AID00134271	I'm great at punching people. I'm not gonna lie. It's a gift.
AID00134272	Well, thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl from California with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
AID00134273	Let's hit the road, huh?
AID00134274	VDialogueBennyIntercom
AID00134275	Hey, baby! Over here!
AID00134276	I ain't waiting all day, baby.
AID00134277	Baby, I'm dying over here.
AID00134278	I'm persistent, that's all.
AID00134279	Yeah, that's one word for it.
AID00134280	VDialogueBennyCaged
AID00134281	Check out the digs. Real cozy in here.
AID00134282	I can hardly stand the excitement.
AID00134283	These Legion boys are coo-coo, you realize?
AID00134284	What are you waiting for? Do it!
AID00134285	Come on, end it!
AID00134286	You gonna do it or not?
AID00134287	VDialogueBennyArena
AID00134288	Thanks again for this. You're platinum, baby.
AID00134289	VDialogueBennyButchered
AID00134290	You think you scare me? Come on! Do it!
AID00134291	That the best you can do?
AID00134292	I didn't even feel that one!
AID00134293	That's right, gimme another!
AID00134294	I thought this was supposed to hurt!
AID00134295	Come on, ya bum! Put your shoulder into it!
AID00134296	Come on, ya bitch! You swing like a girl!
AID00134297	VDialogueBennyCrucified
AID00134298	Happy now, you twisted bitch? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
AID00134299	Happy now, you twisted bum? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
AID00134300	Scram, will ya?
AID00134301	I got nothing to say to you.
AID00134302	VDialogueBennyBodyguardsNo
AID00134303	I'm gonna take a meeting with this pally up in the Prez. You boys wait at the bottom of the elevator. You hear trouble, come up blazing.
AID00134304	A Securitron dug me up and a doc in Goodsprings did the rest.
AID00134305	House was on to me from word Go? I thought I was being so clever...
AID00134306	It takes more than a couple bullets in the head to stop me.
AID00134307	Yeah, hello... Well, serves me right for using a 9mm.
AID00134308	Call it luck and leave it at that.
AID00134309	Luck is for losers, baby. Someone pulled strings.
AID00134310	<Go to sleep.>
AID00134311	Zzzz....
AID00134312	<Kill Benny in his sleep.>
AID00134313	Huh...? Hnngk!
AID00134314	Let's talk about something else.
AID00134315	Or I could kill you right now, while your hands are bound.
AID00134316	On second thought, maybe I should fight you in the arena.
AID00134317	I have to decide what happens to you now.
AID00134318	None of your business. It's time for you to die.
AID00134319	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, just like Mr. House wants.
AID00134320	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
AID00134321	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
AID00134322	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
AID00134323	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
AID00134324	There were hundreds of Securitrons down there - until I blew them up.
AID00134325	What? How could you do that?
AID00134326	You loser! You had Vegas in the palm of your hand and you threw it away?
AID00134327	Something bad could happen to you right here...
AID00134328	Maybe we should face each other in the arena, fair and square.
AID00134329	How do you feel about crucifixion?
AID00134330	I could have you brought before me hog-tied, then hack you to death.
AID00134331	I haven't made up my mind.
AID00134332	Tell me about the factions that want to rule Vegas.
AID00134333	I want to know more about you.
AID00134334	Caesar says I get to decide how you die.
AID00134335	What do you think I should do with the Chip?
AID00134336	Tell me about the factions that want to rule Vegas.
AID00134337	What happened after you fled the Tops?
AID00134338	I prefer the term "relocated."
AID00134339	It took every Stealth Boy I had to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove. That was a close shave, riding a boat full of Legion boys.
AID00134340	Once I was across, I changed into a uniform I swiped off a dead Legionary outside Nelson. Tried to sneak into the bunker, but that didn't work out.
AID00134341	They found the Chip. I wasn't gonna tell them what it was used for, but... let's just say they were persuasive.
AID00134342	Caesar says I get to decide how you die.
AID00134343	He gave me the Platinum Chip.
AID00134344	Sure, Baldie wants you to go down in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
AID00134345	You don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
AID00134346	You go down there and use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
AID00134347	I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
AID00134348	Looks like you played past your abilities.
AID00134349	Didn't leave much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
AID00134350	You have no one to blame but yourself.
AID00134351	Did I say I blamed society? I know why I'm here, baby. Do you?
AID00134352	I'll laugh later. We have business to discuss.
AID00134353	That we do, baby, that we do...
AID00134354	It is pretty funny.
AID00134355	Yeah, well, laugh it up on your own time.
AID00134356	Sorry, Benny, didn't make much of an impression.
AID00134357	Oh I made an impression all right! The dent in that mattress was permanent!
AID00134358	I didn't come here to reminisce.
AID00134359	Well ain't you a sentimental broad? Gimme a sec to jump off Cloud 9, I'll meet you on the ground...
AID00134360	You were amazing.
AID00134361	Don't I know it! Too bad a conjugal visit here isn't practical...
AID00134362	Close your eyes, if you want.
AID00134363	Nah, I'd rather see it coming.
AID00134364	Do it, baby. Make it clean.
AID00134365	Hand over the Chip or else.
AID00134366	Or else what, punk? Or else this?
AID00134367	All right, I'll meet you in the Presidential Suite.
AID00134368	Baby, wow-ee wow wow! You and me are gonna swing!
AID00134369	Here's the key. I'll be by in a few... just as soon as my legs stop shaking.
AID00134370	Why would I trust you?
AID00134371	I know, I made a bad first impression. You got every reason to think I'm a creep. But baby, this is an 18 karat opportunity.
AID00134372	I've got the Chip, but to see this shin-dig through to the end? I'm gonna need help. And hello! Who shows up but you?
AID00134373	It can't be a coincidence, baby. You and me were meant to work together.
AID00134374	No deal. Time to die.
AID00134375	It was worth a try.
AID00134376	You're a dead man.
AID00134377	You cheating bastard.
AID00134378	Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
AID00134379	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful. But soon you won't feel a thing. Ta-ta.
AID00134380	There's no need for violence.
AID00134381	Baby, if ever there was a need for violence, you is it. Just do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Ta-ta.
AID00134382	Hand over the Platinum Chip, maybe you live.
AID00134383	Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's... special. But savor this, baby...
AID00134384	I can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
AID00134385	Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
AID00134386	I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
AID00134387	Baby, the meet and greet we scheduled in the Presidential? The whole point is to explain why I can't hand the Chip over.
AID00134388	Now let's just forget this little ambush, and meet up in the suite like we planned. How's that sound?
AID00134389	Mr. House wants the Platinum Chip. Hand it over.
AID00134390	You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
AID00134391	Something bad could happen to you right here...
AID00134392	The direct approach, hey? Fair enough.
AID00134393	But you should wait until the bunker's taken care of. Caesar won't like it if you eat dessert first.
AID00134394	Sure, here it comes.
AID00134395	I'll believe it when it happens!
AID00134396	Let's do it. <Final decision.>
AID00134397	You're a class act, baby. Not to say I'm gonna make it easy for you...
AID00134398	Maybe I should hack you to death while you're bound helpless.
AID00134399	Pass the time thinking over your mistakes. <Final decision.>
AID00134400	You sick, vindictive fuck!
AID00134401	I could crucify you instead.
AID00134402	It's going to hurt. A lot. <Final decision.>
AID00134403	You sick, twisted fuck!
AID00134404	I've decided to kill you here and now.
AID00134405	I see. Keep it simple, hey? Around here, it's one of the better options...
AID00134406	We'll fight in the arena, fair and square.
AID00134407	Machetes at twenty paces, hey? I accept your challenge.
AID00134408	You'll be crucified for my amusement.
AID00134409	Don't do that, baby, not crucifixion. I could be up there for days with those twisted creeps laughing and pointing.
AID00134410	I'm going to hack you to death while you're tied up, helpless.
AID00134411	No, come on, don't slaughter me like I'm some kind of animal!
AID00134412	<I can give you a few moments.>
AID00134413	<Yes.>
AID00134414	How did Mr. House introduce himself?
AID00134415	We were east of Vegas when the first Securitron we ever saw rolled up on us. We junked it in a minute flat.
AID00134416	The next day twenty roll up. So we listened.
AID00134417	Said we'd been selected. Vegas needed us to defend it. In exchange, we'd get cushy digs, full stomachs, medical treatment.
AID00134418	Everything a nomad never gets, in other words. Most of the tribe thought we should say no. I thought it was the best idea ever.
AID00134419	Was your tribe always called the Chairmen?
AID00134420	Nah, in the way-back we called ourselves the Boot Riders. Silly name, but that's how we rode the Mojave, dig? - on our feet.
AID00134421	We were nomadic badasses, not to be trifled with. A gang of ruffians, though with a certain panache.
AID00134422	When House gave us the Tops to renovate, his robots dropped off boxes full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes. Told us we were the "Chairmen" now.
AID00134423	That caused an uproar. But I said "the name sticks." Ciao to the old ways, baby - time to swing in style. If the shoes fit, you wear them.
AID00134424	How long were you the head of the family?
AID00134425	Seven years. Took over three days after Mr. House introduced himself.
AID00134426	Our chief at the time, mountain of a guy named Bingo, wanted to stay nomadic. I disagreed, so he challenged me to the knife.
AID00134427	He looked so surprised when I stuck that knife in his neck. Thought he was so tough, but he was so slow.
AID00134428	That's how I made chief. It's how things were back then.
AID00134429	Tell me about the Three Families.
AID00134430	More like two, after what you did to the Omertas.
AID00134431	The Chairmen are true blue. The Omertas are degenerates - never trust them. Or the White Gloves - just something creepy about them.
AID00134432	Set it up right, and the families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
AID00134433	You think Caesar would destroy the Strip?
AID00134434	Nah, just spruce it up with a crucifixion here and there. Come closer so I can step on you.
AID00134435	The Legion is twisted, baby - original losers worshipping the king of creeps like he's some kind of god.
AID00134436	They're worse than roaches. My advice? Put on your stomping shoes.
AID00134437	What's so bad about the NCR?
AID00134438	Ain't we covered this? The only thing not bad about them is they ain't Legion.
AID00134439	The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave, only difference is they pass laws to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
AID00134440	Why shouldn't Mr. House run Vegas?
AID00134441	You cashed out the old man? So how's it feel to end an era?
AID00134442	You got the future of Vegas in the palm of your hand, baby. What happens next is up to you.
AID00134443	Mr. House is already out of the picture.
AID00134444	Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
AID00134445	Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone gotta do what he says. Just figuring that out?
AID00134446	Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
AID00134447	What if my choice is "none of the above?"
AID00134448	Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
AID00134449	First base is whatever Mr. House would have you do. Follow orders, rig the game to his specifications.
AID00134450	Then, when he ain't looking, you knock him out of the running and find a way to take control of those Securitrons of his.
AID00134451	Go see Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
AID00134452	Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
AID00134453	First base is do whatever Mr. House would've had you do. Finish rigging the game, then puzzle out how to take over where he left off, dig?
AID00134454	For hows and whats, just talk to Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
AID00134455	Maybe we should fight it out in the arena, fair and square.
AID00134456	You'd do that for me, baby? Don't tease if you don't mean it.
AID00134457	Crucifixion is an option.
AID00134458	Yeah, real popular around here. It's a crowd pleaser.
AID00134459	I was thinking I might hack you to death while you're still tied up.
AID00134460	Yeah... getting butchered like livestock. Something to aspire to.
AID00134461	I haven't made up my mind.
AID00134462	I know, so many options! How do you choose just one?
AID00134463	Do you have a preference?
AID00134464	Yeah, to die in my sleep at a ripe old age after a marathon session of hey-hey with thirty sex-starved broads. You'll set that up?
AID00134465	Look, I ain't a harbor for illusions. I ain't expecting to get out of this shin-dig alive.
AID00134466	That's why I'm trying to hand you my scheme, baby. It's called having a legacy.
AID00134467	Tell me about yourself, before it's too late.
AID00134468	The jig's up, Benny. Me and Yes Man had a talk.
AID00134469	Baby, this is not the place to go talking about that!
AID00134470	You'll answer my questions now, not later.
AID00134471	It can't work like that, baby - not out in public like this. You really need me to spell that out?
AID00134472	Yeah, it's a real mess here - four bodies.
AID00134473	I'm coming for you, Benny.
AID00134474	Your little ambush didn't go according to plan.
AID00134475	What the fuck...?
AID00134476	What angle are you playing?
AID00134477	Angle? I'm head-on, baby, flat-out, all stops pulled, full steam ahead.
AID00134478	Side bets are for losers. I'm playing to win.
AID00134479	What is the Platinum Chip?
AID00134480	It's the House edge, baby. The key to stacking the odds in his favor - or was, until I swiped it.
AID00134481	There's more to it, but we don't have the time. By which I mean you don't.
AID00134482	<Speech check to really convince him.>
AID00134483	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit, I'm actually gonna to let you live. What's come over me?
AID00134484	Scramsville, baby. The Strip and you part ways, dig? You come around me again, you won't be getting back up.
AID00134485	I "dig your line." Let me live, you'll never see me again.
AID00134486	[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
AID00134487	My skull isn't thick to forgiveness! Um...
AID00134488	The least you could do is answer some questions first.
AID00134489	A lifelong-learner is you, hey? Then make your questions count, because your lifelong is running lifeshort.
AID00134490	<Speech check to get Benny to back off.>
AID00134491	[SUCCEEDED] All this is just work ethic run wild, that's your line? I don't know...
AID00134492	Can you get it through your thick skull to leave me and the Chip alone? If bullets can't get through, what hope is there?
AID00134493	All I am is a courier trying to fulfill my contract.
AID00134494	[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
AID00134495	But... I'm not mad. Really, I'm not mad!
AID00134496	You're a dead man.
AID00134497	That temper of yours? Kinda why this conversation's taking place over an intercom.
AID00134498	Do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Good night all! It's been a gas...
AID00134499	You cheating bastard.
AID00134500	Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
AID00134501	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful, full of disappointments.
AID00134502	So where does this put the two of us?
AID00134503	Nowheresville, that's where. Sorry about the double-cross - or are we up to quadruple? - but if someone's gonna die, it's you.
AID00134504	Can you offer any additional support?
AID00134505	Like I said earlier, we have some supplemental forces on the way, but this wasn't the situation I was expecting, so I can only offer what is on hand.
AID00134506	Ok, I'll take care of him.
AID00134507	Thanks for your support. I'll make sure that the NCR Emergency radio is up and running. Go kill those bastards.
AID00134508	<Debug: Don't Delete>Oliver Forced Dialogue in Dam.
AID00134509	Okay, listen here. Unless we can get some additional support, I'm going to need you to help me resolve this situation.
AID00134510	You need to make your way to this camp they have on the eastern bank and take out the Legate. That should hamstring this attack.
AID00134511	vHDOliverEmergency5
AID00134512	vHDOliverEmergency4
AID00134513	On my way up here there was some chatter about their commander, the Legate I think he's called, set up at some kind of base on the eastern bank.
AID00134514	vHDOliverEmergency3
AID00134515	I don't know sir. There was some talk of them entering through the clogged intake tunnels, but I don't have any confirmation.
AID00134516	vHDOliverEmergency2
AID00134517	Into the power station? How is that possible?
AID00134518	vHDOliverEmergency1
AID00134519	Sir! I don't know what happened, a bunch of Legionnaires just stormed into the power station.
AID00134520	What opportunity is that?
AID00134521	We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf.
AID00134522	I am in the beginning stages of planning out an assault on The Fort. I've made calls to our allies, and they are on their way to our position.
AID00134523	Once our forces are in placed and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
AID00134524	I don't have time to talk right now.
AID00134525	Good, you just stand there and listen, then, that'll make this go faster.
AID00134526	What is this all about?
AID00134527	You've done some great work for us up to this point, and we are hoping to use your unique abilities to aid us once again.
AID00134528	Thanks to the tasks my subordinates have delegated to you, the NCR now has a unique opportunity.
AID00134529	What will happen to Lily?
AID00134530	Permanent damage to her mind is a certainty. Even the cure won't help her.
AID00134531	Let me think about this.
AID00134532	I understand. Get back to me with an answer as soon as you can.
AID00134533	What do you want to do?
AID00134534	I'm close to the cure, I can feel it. Lily's continued help will give me the last bit of data that I need.
AID00134535	I think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
AID00134536	Very well. It will be worth it, I'm sure.
AID00134537	The risk to Lily is too great. Don't keep running the test.
AID00134538	All right. I'll dismantle the prototype to avoid any further incidents with the Nightkin.
AID00134539	GKRitemasterFailure
AID00134540	GKRitemasterSuccess
AID00134541	On second thought, never mind.
AID00134542	I've got it. Let's do this.
AID00134543	Run that by me again.
AID00134544	No, tell me what I have to do.
AID00134545	I'd like to join the Great Khans.
AID00134546	Well then, never mind.
AID00134547	Okay.
AID00134548	<Give Med-X> Painkillers like these, you mean?
AID00134549	Whoa... you were serious. Okay, yeah, this might just work. Thanks.
AID00134550	Just wait here a minute, I'll be back with some Med-X.
AID00134551	Really? Wow, um... okay. Thanks.
AID00134552	Why don't you just cheat?
AID00134553	Cheat? The only way I could cheat is if I was so doped up on painkillers that I don't feel anything.
AID00134554	It sounds like you're not happy being a Great Khan. Maybe you'd be happier someplace else.
AID00134555	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe you're right. Maybe I can find my true calling, someplace they'll appreciate my poetry! Someplace like the Old Mormon Fort, maybe.
AID00134556	Do you think the Followers of the Apocalypse would take me? I remember all those books they brought us when they visited our tribe.
AID00134557	[FAILED] I don't know... the Khans don't really get me, but at least they're family, you know?
AID00134558	Maybe you should just ditch this place.
AID00134559	That doesn't sound so bad.
AID00134560	Sure, maybe not if you're some hulking reprobate like Regis or baked to the gills like Jack. I've tried five times and still haven't made it.
AID00134561	< Science 90 >
AID00134562	[SUCCEEDED] That's... brilliant. Simple, yet elegant. I can't believe I didn't think of that.
AID00134563	Use neuro-peptide stimulators on a Nightstalker brain. Results should be similar to a live brain.
AID00134564	[FAILED] Neuron decay is rapid after death, and I doubt a live Nightstalker would cooperate with my test.
AID00134565	You said Nightstalker brains were similar. What about just testing those?
AID00134566	All right, if you're sure. Let's talk about something else.
AID00134567	Certainly!
AID00134568	You can always say no.
AID00134569	I know that, dearie.
AID00134570	There's a risk that the mental damage will be permanent.
AID00134571	Of course, dearie.
AID00134572	Doctor Henry wants to know if you'll continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
AID00134573	Of course I will, dearie, if it's helpful. Don't you worry what will happen to little old me. I'm tougher than I look!
AID00134574	Don't worry, I'm not giving up. Let's try it again.
AID00134575	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
AID00134576	Give me some time to figure things out and we'll try again.
AID00134577	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
AID00134578	Razz wants the usual.
AID00134579	Groovetastic. Tell him it's on his tab.
AID00134580	On second thought, I'll ask around first.
AID00134581	Whatever you think's best.
AID00134582	Okay, I'll try to convince them.
AID00134583	Okay!
AID00134584	So you think I should find ways to convince the Misfits to get along?
AID00134585	That'd be swell. Only, if they knew the idea came from me, they probably wouldn't take you serious no more, so maybe you oughta think about it first.
AID00134586	And I sure hope you're more convincing than I am, or they ain't gonna listen.
AID00134587	What do you mean?
AID00134588	Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
AID00134589	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
AID00134590	Maybe you just ain't had a healthy dose of human niceness in a while.
AID00134591	Human niceness?
AID00134592	That's right. Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
AID00134593	Maybe I'll ask around a little more instead.
AID00134594	As you wish; I'm sure the optimal solution will become apparent to you in time.
AID00134595	I'll do it. Work is overrated anyways.
AID00134596	Excellent! Squad readiness records can be accessed from two terminals at the resort: the main terminal in the lobby or a secure one in a back office.
AID00134597	The main terminal is typically unlocked, but is also in the middle of a major thoroughfare, you'll have to be stealthy to access it.
AID00134598	The office terminal is locked, but you might have an easier time accessing it, especially at night.
AID00134599	On second thought, I'll talk to the others first.
AID00134600	Whatever.
AID00134601	I'm convinced this is a good idea, let's do it.
AID00134602	Right. Head to Red Rock Canyon - that's deep Khan territory, so watch your back. Talk to Jack, tell him Razz wants the usual. See you soon.
AID00134603	Okay, tell me where to get it.
AID00134604	My man Jack at Red Rock Canyon got the goods. But listen: once you get folks dosed on Psycho, ain't a lot of room for much else.
AID00134605	So if you got any other plans for bulking up the Misfits crew, might want to see about them first.
AID00134606	Angry... juice?
AID00134607	Psycho! The big red one! I used to run with the Fiends, I still got the hookups. Smuggle some in and you'll see an improvement.
AID00134608	I'm sure. Let's do it.
AID00134609	You're the boss.
AID00134610	Never mind, I'll talk to the others about their ideas first.
AID00134611	Okay, I'll be here if you come to your senses.
AID00134612	Okay, let's get them out to the range.
AID00134613	Are you sure? I've got enough clout to get them started, but these guys are pretty lazy. I doubt they'll want to be pulled in different directions.
AID00134614	It can't be as hard as all that. What needs to get done?
AID00134615	Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get the whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
AID00134616	I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
AID00134617	This is all I could find.
AID00134618	I found more NCR stuff.
AID00134619	Now what are we looking for?
AID00134620	I think this is everything.
AID00134621	I found some NCR stuff.
AID00134622	What exactly are we looking for here?
AID00134623	Not yet.
AID00134624	Well, hurry it up. We don't have much time.
AID00134625	Goodbye.
AID00134626	See you.
AID00134627	Goodbye.
AID00134628	Finally.
AID00134629	Goodbye.
AID00134630	Bye.
AID00134631	Do you think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype?
AID00134632	Absolutely not. Lily's done enough, and she doesn't need to do any more. We're close enough to a cure already, and don't need to rush it.
AID00134633	I've brought a brain to transplant into Rex.
AID00134634	I can probably handle that. Just the same as changing a light bulb, except stickier and smellier. Right?
AID00134635	Anyway, what did you bring me?
AID00134636	Doctor Henry wants Lily to continue wearing the prototype. What do you think?
AID00134637	Up to Lily. Not my call. Might lead to a faster cure. Might not. Don't want any harm coming to her.
AID00134638	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
AID00134639	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
AID00134640	Why the rush to leave? You said you would help clear the caves.
AID00134641	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
AID00134642	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
AID00134643	Well, have a safe trip.
AID00134644	If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
AID00134645	If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
AID00134646	Hey, you said you would help clear the caves.
AID00134647	I know, but now that I can see the way out, I'm not so sure. I'd rather not join my dead buddies anytime soon.
AID00134648	I'm going to start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
AID00134649	I'll find you when you're done here.
AID00134650	Wait for me downstairs, this won't take long.
AID00134651	
AID00134652	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, this isn't worth the trouble to fight over.
AID00134653	They have a point, it is their armor. You should give it back.
AID00134654	[FAILED] No, we have men to outfit and are putting it to good use.
AID00134655	You should listen to them. They have lasers, you know.
AID00134656	Would it be so bad to lend them the armor for the battle?
AID00134657	[FAILED] Yes, it would be, we can't have outsiders running around using our technology.
AID00134658	[SUCCEEDED] It would mean more people better protected and able to fight.
AID00134659	vHDPowerArmor
AID00134660	This is unacceptable, we demand the immediate return of our power armor.
AID00134661	A battle is about to be fought out there, to come here requesting our men to give up their armor is insane.
AID00134662	It is not your armor, that power armor is property of the Brotherhood of Steel and you have no right to claim it as your own.
AID00134663	VMSHD
AID00134664	Goodbye.
AID00134665	Yes, yes.
AID00134666	You won't have any more trouble with those mercenaries.
AID00134667	Good. Glad you didn't kill them. Letting them walk away proves we're not bloodthirsty mutants.
AID00134668	If NCR or anybody else is looking for an excuse to attack Jacobstown, they're not going to get it from us.
AID00134669	Here's your money - 2000 caps, as we agreed.
AID00134670	All right, then. We'll be on our way.
AID00134671	I'll need 2000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
AID00134672	That's not too bad. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
AID00134673	I hear you're mercenaries. Will caps make you go away?
AID00134674	We're still owed half - 2500 caps. Pay up and we'll be on our way. If you're short, maybe you can get the money from the muties.
AID00134675	I'll need 2500 caps to pay the mercenaries.
AID00134676	That puts a dent in the town treasury. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
AID00134677	<Lie> I'll need 3000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
AID00134678	Damn it. That'll wipe out the town treasury. If that's what it takes...
AID00134679	Here's your money - 2500 caps.
AID00134680	A deal's a deal. We'll be on our way.
AID00134681	< Barter - 55 >
AID00134682	[SUCCEEDED] That thought had crossed my mind as well, actually. Fine, make it 2000 caps and we'll call it square.
AID00134683	2500 caps? I'm doing you a favor by paying you now. I doubt you were expected to survive this.
AID00134684	[FAILED] Sorry, but I've got men to pay and equipment to maintain. 2500 caps or no deal.
AID00134685	2500 caps is too much. Can't we come to a deal on a lower price?
AID00134686	< Speech - 65 >
AID00134687	[SUCCEEDED] I've always known when to fight and when to back down, and it seems to me I ought to back down this time.
AID00134688	My men and I are leaving. You won't see us around here again.
AID00134689	Go away or you'll have to deal with me, and you'll wish you were fighting Super Mutants instead.
AID00134690	[FAILED] I've faced down a charging Deathclaw and didn't blink. What makes you think I'd back down from you?
AID00134691	You should leave before I... get mad.
AID00134692	Who are you doing this for?
AID00134693	Won't name names, but some important folks in the NCR are sick of muties attacking their Brahmin herds. They want them gone from NCR territory.
AID00134694	Maybe this group had something to do with attacking Brahmin, maybe not. Doesn't matter. We're getting paid to make them go away.
AID00134695	What do you want with Jacobstown?
AID00134696	Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
AID00134697	Either way, the job's not done until they've cleared out of the town.
AID00134698	Goodbye.
AID00134699	Yep, get a move on.
AID00134700	I'd rather not get involved.
AID00134701	All right. Can't say I blame you.
AID00134702	I'll see what I can do.
AID00134703	Thanks.
AID00134704	What do you want me to do?
AID00134705	You're human - they might be willing to be listen to what you have to say. Maybe.
AID00134706	I'm not asking you to kill them. Just talk them into leaving. Hell, pay them off if you have to.
AID00134707	Why can't you just take them out?
AID00134708	Not looking to fight. That'll give NCR an excuse to come up here and wipe us out.
AID00134709	You're sure these mercenaries work for the NCR?
AID00134710	Guess I can't say for sure if they're NCR. Whoever they are, they want us dead or gone.
AID00134711	How have they been harassing the town?
AID00134712	Killing our Bighorners, shooting at the lodge, that sort of thing. It's getting hard to keep people from retaliating.
AID00134713	I'm looking for Doctor Henry.
AID00134714	Doc's inside the Lodge.
AID00134715	I'm a hero in the NCR, and I think you need to leave. Now.
AID00134716	Whoa, whoa. Thought you looked familiar. I'm just doing a job, nothing more. Politics aren't my thing, so if you say go, we'll go. No hard feelings.
AID00134717	vHDPowerArmor2
AID00134718	You know what? I don't need this bullshit right now. We'll take off that goddamn power armor, if it'll just shut you up.
AID00134719	I'm sure you two can settle this.
AID00134720	I'm sure that we can.
AID00134721	I'd love to hear your dissertation, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.
AID00134722	Can I get the abridged version?
AID00134723	Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I do tend to get wrapped up in my own theories and forget that not everyone finds them as fascinating as I do.
AID00134724	Here, I salvaged this book from an old library. It's a history of a people called the Mongols. I think that's what the Khans built their culture on.
AID00134725	You should read it, it's fascinating stuff.
AID00134726	This is fascinating. Please continue.
AID00134727	Well, after they migrated to the Mojave, we established relations with them, but that soured when all they wanted was to make drugs.
AID00134728	The NCR eventually took them down quite a bit, but the really fascinating thing about them is the origin of their culture as a whole. You see....
AID00134729	Julie Farkas said you might know something about the Great Khans.
AID00134730	Oh my, yes! They're a fascinating tribe with a long and, unfortunately, tragic history.
AID00134731	Their original incarnation, much farther out west, was almost completely wiped out by one of those itinerant heroes so common in the post-War years.
AID00134732	Then of course the "New Khans" suffered a similar fate, some say at the hands of the same hero, though of course the dates are all wrong for that.
AID00134733	On second thought, never mind.
AID00134734	Was there something else you needed?
AID00134735	Where can I find this Ezekiel?
AID00134736	He rarely stops in here these days - you'd do best to look for him out in the wastes east of New Vegas. He's always looking for new tribes to study.
AID00134737	Who is Ezekiel?
AID00134738	He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is pre-War history and tribal culture.
AID00134739	I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans, he kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
AID00134740	I'm looking for something that could inspire the Great Khans. Know of anything like that?
AID00134741	The Great Khans? Oh, you mean those raiders that used to clash with the Vegas tribes?
AID00134742	Yes, some years back we taught them reading, writing, basic science - we hoped they would use it to make medical supplies, but they turned to drugs.
AID00134743	I was never much involved in the cultural side of that project, but Ezekiel was.
AID00134744	Have a look at this book. Your tribe is nothing but a bunch of thugs, aping the glories of the past.
AID00134745	I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
AID00134746	If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
AID00134747	Have a look at this book. If you want to see what your tribe could be, read about the Mongol Empire.
AID00134748	Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
AID00134749	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AID00134750	Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
AID00134751	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AID00134752	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AID00134753	Any idea where I might look to find such inspiration from the past?
AID00134754	The Followers of the Apocalypse keep many records of the past. It's been a long time since we associated with them, but they might have something.
AID00134755	Until you do find me something, though, know that I still plan to lead the Great Khans to fight for Caesar.
AID00134756	I can clear out Cottonwood Cove for you.
AID00134757	I just killed everyone the old-fashioned way.
AID00134758	A single man slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! I'm amazed.
AID00134759	It took everything we had in the last battle at the dam to stand against those brutes. You're a beast, son.
AID00134760	You've done a fine job, friend. Here is a little something for your work.
AID00134761	A single woman slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! Oh, that's priceless!
AID00134762	Considering the way Caesar treats women, that should really put some doubts into his troops' minds. Wait til the rangers hear about this!
AID00134763	You've done a fine job, friend. Here's a little something for your work.
AID00134764	I released some barrels of radioactive waste.
AID00134765	That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
AID00134766	Fitting that the camp was taken care of in a way similar to Searchlight. Thank you for taking care of that place for us.
AID00134767	I killed everyone in the camp.
AID00134768	What?! How did you pull it off?
AID00134769	Nothing new to report.
AID00134770	Anything else?
AID00134771	[Give Aurelius' old intel] I planted the bug and found some paperwork.
AID00134772	This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
AID00134773	Looks like they're planning to shift their raids north of Vegas. I'll shift some of the rangers and NCR patrols in that direction when they're free.
AID00134774	Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
AID00134775	Maybe later.
AID00134776	Yeah, I know I wouldn't sign up for that solo op if asked.
AID00134777	I'll see what I can do.
AID00134778	Report back when the camp is clear. I'll try and shuffle some men in that direction once the Legion is gone.
AID00134779	Consider it done.
AID00134780	What?.. Really?! You're mad, but I like it!
AID00134781	According to the notes you gave me, all of the southern raiding parties come from that camp. Caesar regularly sends fresh squads to relieve patrols.
AID00134782	Killing their Centurion and leadership would be a start, but finding a way to permanently shut down that dock is what we really need.
AID00134783	I already took care of the camp.
AID00134784	Is there anything else you need done?
AID00134785	Well, unless you want to go in there and clean out that camp for me, I guess this should be more than enough for now.
AID00134786	[Give intel] I planted the bug in Cottonwood Cove's radio and found some intel.
AID00134787	This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
AID00134788	Looks like they're planning to strike some of the southern caravans. I'll notify the rangers and patrols in that area immediately.
AID00134789	Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
AID00134790	I have an update on Cottonwood Cove.
AID00134791	I can help you with Cottonwood Cove.
AID00134792	I released some barrels of radioactive waste.
AID00134793	That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
AID00134794	It's a fitting revenge for Searchlight. Thanks for taking care of those bastards for us.
AID00134795	Maybe later.
AID00134796	Just let me know if you're available for the op. After what they did to Searchlight, they have a shitstorm coming.
AID00134797	I think I can handle that for you.
AID00134798	Good to hear. This is the bug you'll need for the radio.
AID00134799	Report back if you pick up any intel or manage to sneak the bug into their radio.
AID00134800	I already took care of the camp.
AID00134801	What?! How did you pull it off?
AID00134802	Is there anything you need done?
AID00134803	If you can scout out the camp, bring back any intel on troop movement or plans for future raids. The rangers could put that information to good use.
AID00134804	Also, if you're any good at covert ops, I would love to get a bug planted on their radio. So far, we've been unable to crack their encryption.
AID00134805	I found a Legion camp at Cottonwood Cove.
AID00134806	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, thanks to the Chip.
AID00134807	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
AID00134808	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
AID00134809	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
AID00134810	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
AID00134811	Let's go find it.
AID00134812	I like the way you think.
AID00134813	Maybe the pulse gun would be a smarter move.
AID00134814	I changed my mind. Let's go after the farming tech.
AID00134815	Actually, the rangefinder might be a better idea.
AID00134816	We should go after the vegetation technology.
AID00134817	Okay. What better way to persuade them than to give them a taste of what they stand to gain, right?
AID00134818	Maybe the best place to start is to see what we can find out directly from the NCR. Let's head to their OSI office at McCarran.
AID00134819	The rangefinder sounds promising.
AID00134820	They defended HELIOS like it was their last stand. Didn't even know if there was anything worth defending. How could there be, with all we lost?
AID00134821	Even if it did work, it'd be under NCR control now. So it'd either prove our goals are wrong or we're incapable of pursuing them.
AID00134822	There's a pawn shop in Outer Vegas we could check. And I've heard of a gift shop in the Strip that deals in Pre-War antiques.
AID00134823	Let's pursue the pulse gun.
AID00134824	Yeah, maybe they'll think twice about engaging the NCR if they know one of those could be floating around.
AID00134825	The notes say to look around Nellis Air Force Base. He suggests going through filing cabinets and computers in the commanding officer's quarters.
AID00134826	Farming technology?
AID00134827	More or less. Supposedly it's a vegetation enhancer. NCR has a science branch headquartered at McCarran airport. Guess they found something.
AID00134828	Guess somebody wasn't very good at keeping secrets, either.
AID00134829	We'd never pursue it because it's not a weapon. But self-sufficiency is fundamental to us. If it works they'd see the value of an alternate course.
AID00134830	What's a pulse gun?
AID00134831	Electromagnetic weapon from before the Great War. Experimental. It never saw mass production.
AID00134832	But they were building it as a countermeasure to power armor, which they feared the Chinese were developing.
AID00134833	Supposedly a prototype was being housed at Nellis. Imagine what it could do to the Brotherhood. We'd be on equal footing with any idiot with a gun.
AID00134834	Tell me about the rangefinder.
AID00134835	It's a targeting device for some kind of doomsday weapon based at HELIOS One. It was lost sometime after the War.
AID00134836	We held HELIOS One for a time. Lost a lot of people defending it. Too many. All for this weapon they never got working.
AID00134837	If it turns out to be a dud, it'd show how flawed our goals have been. Father Elijah said he thinks a scavenger might have sold it on the Strip.
AID00134838	VMS49ElderDiscussion1
AID00134839	Hello Veronica. How goes your mission?
AID00134840	We'll know in a second. I wanted to talk to you.
AID00134841	Veronica, tell me this isn't about-
AID00134842	Yes, goddamn it, it is. But you're going to hear me out this time.
AID00134843	We've been through this.
AID00134844	The things I've seen now. Other groups succeeding where we fail. It's not too late for us.
AID00134845	We've outlasted the end of the world. We'll outlast these upstarts.
AID00134846	Waiting in a hole for everyone else to die.
AID00134847	If we must.
AID00134848	This is a dead end for us.
AID00134849	I see no evidence of that. Nor do I see anyone out there with a solution to our problems.
AID00134850	How could you? You're too scared to look.
AID00134851	Let's go. We're wasting our time.
AID00134852	Have you considered that he might be right?
AID00134853	Have you considered that he might be senile?
AID00134854	The Brotherhood's strategy for survival worked back when we had a larger force, and no organized enemies.
AID00134855	We're a tiny splinter from a shrinking group. We don't take on new members. But we're still picking fights with the big boys.
AID00134856	Good intentions don't justify marching the Brotherhood to its death.
AID00134857	No, but it does make it easier to forgive him. He's just misguided.
AID00134858	It's not too late to change his mind.
AID00134859	Let's head out.
AID00134860	I'm with you. Being around here isn't the same anymore.
AID00134861	Father Elijah?
AID00134862	Our Elder before McNamara. He had a nose for recovering lost technology. He'd send Scribes out into the desert chasing whatever leads he found.
AID00134863	There were a few he only trusted me with. I can think of at least one that'd prove my point, if it still exists.
AID00134864	There's a comm terminal not too far from here I'd use to access messages from him. If we go there I can pull up his research on it.
AID00134865	How would you propose to do that?
AID00134866	Look at the Followers of the Apocalypse. They use their expertise to improve people's lives. They train them to be self-sufficient.
AID00134867	That expertise cultivates respect and gratitude. Spreads their ideals. Draws talent to their cause. They make friends like we make enemies.
AID00134868	But they don't know a fraction of what we know. If we took on their role, we could stand up to anyone. We wouldn't have to hide.
AID00134869	So what is it you're trying to accomplish?
AID00134870	That's my question to the Elder. All these years, the Brotherhood has collected weapons technology. And for what?
AID00134871	To keep it out of people's hands? That clearly hasn't worked. To defend ourselves? We can't compete with the NCR's numbers. Or the Legion's.
AID00134872	We're fighting a war for a lost cause. If we're going to survive, we have to find a role in society. Attract new members.
AID00134873	What could we bring to him that would change his mind?
AID00134874	I don't know. I don't know. We'd need something that shows the Brotherhood will fail. Or that it can do better a different way.
AID00134875	The only thing that'd get his attention is technology.
AID00134876	Huh. Maybe Father Elijah had the right idea.
AID00134877	You think the Elder will listen at all?
AID00134878	He's a stubborn old man, but when it comes down to it, he's got our best interests at heart.
AID00134879	If he sees some indisputable sign we're on the wrong course, he won't ignore it.
AID00134880	What now?
AID00134881	I'm not giving up. He wants evidence, but he'll never go looking for it. He's scared I'm right.
AID00134882	He'll never listen unless I hold the proof right in front of his face.
AID00134883	I have things I need to do. You'd better go alone.
AID00134884	Not much for family gatherings, huh? All right, have it your way.
AID00134885	You ever want to look me up again, I'll be in my bunker in Hidden Valley. That's the luxury bunker.
AID00134886	All right, I'll go.
AID00134887	I'm ready to take you to Hidden Valley.
AID00134888	That's just not important right now.
AID00134889	This from the girl who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for her lost package.
AID00134890	This from the guy who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for his lost package.
AID00134891	I hope you change your mind.
AID00134892	Why don't you just go back on your own?
AID00134893	Wow, don't everybody volunteer all at once now.
AID00134894	I could do that. You're not interested in coming along? Hate to break up the band over a silly little thing like the future of everyone I care about.
AID00134895	Can it wait?
AID00134896	Sure, yeah. Just not too long, okay? I worry about them sometimes.
AID00134897	I'll take you back there, first chance I get.
AID00134898	Great. Thanks. Thank you. I'll encourage people to name their non-ugly children after you. Seriously.
AID00134899	What did you want to talk about earlier?
AID00134900	Not now.
AID00134901	Okay. Well, when you do, let me know, all right?
AID00134902	What is it?
AID00134903	The Brotherhood is failing. I've always known that. If we don't change course, we're going to fall apart or... fade away.
AID00134904	But until recently I haven't understood where we went wrong, or how to fix it.
AID00134905	I think I need to go home.
AID00134906	Goodbye.
AID00134907	Take care.
AID00134908	How goes your research for the Nightkin cure?
AID00134909	Promising, but I won't be able to synthesize the drug anytime soon. I really should get back to my work.
AID00134910	One of my limbs is crippled.
AID00134911	I'm suffering from radiation poisoning.
AID00134912	It'll be easy enough to purge all rads from your system.
AID00134913	I'm wounded.
AID00134914	Your injuries aren't too severe. I can patch the scrapes and lacerations pretty easily.
AID00134915	Some of these lacerations are pretty severe and could get infected.
AID00134916	I'm surprised you're still standing. You've lost a lot of blood and should be stabilized immediately.
AID00134917	Never mind.
AID00134918	All right. Was there something else you were interested in?
AID00134919	Enhance my agility.
AID00134920	Your reaction times are already so fast it's a wonder you can't catch bullets. The Reflex Booster can't make you any faster.
AID00134921	The Reflex Booster does exactly what it says - speeds up your reaction times. For 4,000 caps, I can attach the implant to your central nervous node.
AID00134922	I want to be more intelligent.
AID00134923	Your higher brain functions are off the charts. The implant won't help at all - sorry.
AID00134924	For 4,000 caps, I can install a Logic Co-Processor.
AID00134925	I think you would really benefit from the Logic Co-Processor implant, so I'm going to cut the price to 3,000.
AID00134926	Increase my endurance.
AID00134927	Your cardiovascular system is practically super-human. The Nociception Regulator won't boost it any further.
AID00134928	The Nociception Regulator modifies your cardiovascular system, and you won't tire as quickly. The price is 4,000 caps, same as most other implants.
AID00134929	Make me more perceptive.
AID00134930	Your eyesight would make a hawk jealous. The Optic Enhancer implant won't do anything more for you.
AID00134931	The Optics Enhancer, as the name suggests, gets attached directly to your optic nerve. The price is 4,000 caps.
AID00134932	I'd like to have greater strength.
AID00134933	You're already the strongest person I've ever met. The implant won't do anything more for you.
AID00134934	I can implant the Hypertrophy Accelerator for 4,000 caps. It will boost your adrenal glands and quickly increase your muscle mass.
AID00134935	What kind of implants do you have available?
AID00134936	I have several basic implants available that can enhance your physical abilities - make you faster, smarter, stronger, that sort of thing.
AID00134937	I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
AID00134938	The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
AID00134939	Uh, no. Implants, not plants. They're little machines I can put inside you to make you faster, quicker, or smarter. I recommend the smarter implant.
AID00134940	I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
AID00134941	The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
AID00134942	What's your point?
AID00134943	Oh, there's a need for violence. <Attack Benny.>
AID00134944	What's the alternative?
AID00134945	Maybe that's why I broke into the weapons locker.
AID00134946	You're bluffing, baby... Except maybe you're not.
AID00134947	Sweet little caper, getting your weapons back. But let cooler heads prevail, hey? No need for violence.
AID00134948	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
AID00134949	You want a reason, how about four?
AID00134950	They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
AID00134951	Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
AID00134952	Anything I needed to worry about, baby, got confiscated at the door.
AID00134953	Guess who broke into the confiscated weapons locker?
AID00134954	Bombs. Lots of bombs.
AID00134955	The Powder Gangers have access to large quantities of explosives, which they'd be willing to share.
AID00134956	Well now... the armory could always use more firepower. Very well. Tell the Powder Gangers we accept their offer.
AID00134957	However, they would still have to pass the initiation rite to truly join our ranks.
AID00134958	I've come with an offer of alliance from the Powder Gangers at Vault 19.
AID00134959	And what benefit would this alliance give us?
AID00134960	Goodbye.
AID00134961	Okay, then.
AID00134962	Arcade Gannon has asked me to gather all the former members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
AID00134963	You must have something important in mind. I'm willing to go to this little reunion, but my work here isn't complete.
AID00134964	Help me get my research to a stage where I can hand it over to my assistant, Calamity, and then ask me about this again.
AID00134965	I'm intrigued, so I'll go to this reunion. I'll be handing things over to Calamity, so talk to her if anything comes up.
AID00134966	Oh, you'll need my word from the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "friends." Don't forget it.
AID00134967	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
AID00134968	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
AID00134969	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
AID00134970	All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
AID00134971	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
AID00134972	All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
AID00134973	What's your story?
AID00134974	Well, I've lived in Nevada all my life. Started out in New Reno, but headed down here as soon as I got the chance.
AID00134975	If you can believe it, things are even worse back home. The whole city's still run by crime families. Used to be the Mordinos and Wrights.
AID00134976	Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never get better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
AID00134977	I'm here for my "special" order.
AID00134978	Yes, it just came in. Here's all of it.
AID00134979	I'm sorry, but your order won't be in for a while. Please come back in a day or two.
AID00134980	I'm here to talk to you about our new "business" arrangement.
AID00134981	Oh... that. Yes. Anderson filled me in on the details. Just let me know when you'd like your... order to be filled.
AID00134982	Goodbye
AID00134983	See you later.
AID00134984	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00134985	All right.
AID00134986	Tell me about the co-op.
AID00134987	It might not look like much, but it's what keeps us Westside locals independent.
AID00134988	We started it a few years ago. I admit, we had a lot of trouble at first, but eventually we got some help from Tom Anderson with the Followers.
AID00134989	We're finally to the point where the co-op members can start making money from sales instead of just breaking even.
AID00134990	Hope you're not too attached to this place.
AID00134991	Fuck!
AID00134992	[Say nothing.]
AID00134993	Please, just... don't let them shut down the co-op.
AID00134994	I'm going to have a chat with Anderson. Don't worry.
AID00134995	You're the one who should be worried. Good luck.
AID00134996	I'm leaving.
AID00134997	Wait... what are you going to do?
AID00134998	What went down with Anderson and Corporal White?
AID00134999	Pretty much what you'd expect. White talked to Hector and then went to talk to Anderson.
AID00135000	White made the mistake of assuming that because Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse, he wouldn't try anything.
AID00135001	Anderson acted docile, but as soon as White turned to go, Anderson shot him in the back. At least that's what Anderson told me.
AID00135002	Whose idea was it to use the kid?
AID00135003	It was Hector's idea, if you can believe it. He overheard me talking to Anderson about his idea to divert the water over here.
AID00135004	We needed someone to be able to go into the cisterns and get the water out, but any of us would be suspicious. Hector volunteered.
AID00135005	He said that no one pays attention to him, even with his brahmin. Anderson and I argued, but eventually we decided to let him go ahead with it.
AID00135006	Look, this affects all of us, even Hector. What were we supposed to do, let all of our gardens die? Watch Westside fall apart?
AID00135007	I know how the Westside farmers have been getting their water.
AID00135008	Uh... okay, look... first, I didn't have anything to do with that trooper. That was all Anderson.
AID00135009	Second, even though the whole scheme was Anderson's idea, it's the only way the co-op could stay in business. The water means everything.
AID00135010	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00135011	What can I get you?
AID00135012	Goodbye.
AID00135013	Come back real soon!
AID00135014	Goodbye.
AID00135015	I'll see you around.

AID00135020	vHDRadioMonorail
AID00135021	vHDRadio
AID00135022	vHDGeneralChatter
AID00135023	Good to know. I had some other questions.
AID00135024	Like what?
AID00135025	Who do you sell to?
AID00135026	We make regular shipments to a lot of settlements around the Mojave - a lot of our business comes from the Fiends lately.
AID00135027	Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact that they get hopped up on Psycho and harass NCR patrols.
AID00135028	So you're drug dealers?
AID00135029	We're supplying things people want in exchange for things our tribe needs. Don't judge us.
AID00135030	Let's talk about something else.
AID00135031	Sure, what do you want to know?
AID00135032	Why are things so tough?
AID00135033	Red Rock Canyon isn't exactly the most hospitable place - there's no food, barely any water, and nothing anybody wants.
AID00135034	We used to send patrols out to acquire supplies, but ever since Bitter Springs there just aren't enough of us left.
AID00135035	What alliance?
AID00135036	Papa Khan has been talking to Caesar's emissary for weeks now - they're always going on about crushing the NCR.
AID00135037	Papa's announced that if Caesar goes to war against the NCR, the Khans will go with him.
AID00135038	Good to know. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135039	What's on your brainpan?
AID00135040	Who's Jerry?
AID00135041	Ah, the other dudes call him Jerry the Punk. That's kind of harsh, though - I think he's just a sensitive soul that needs some love.
AID00135042	He's usually down around the proving ground if you want to say yo.
AID00135043	Who's Diane?
AID00135044	Diane's my girl, man. We've been taking care of each other our whole lives, ever since our folks died. Now we keep the Khans in caps together.
AID00135045	How'd you get into this business?
AID00135046	Guess I just had a natural talent for it. When I was a kid, these cats called the Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp.
AID00135047	They knew all kinds of kooky scientastical stuff, so I ate up all the chemistry they could teach. Diane had the head for business, so we teamed up.
AID00135048	You're drug dealers?
AID00135049	Naw, man, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
AID00135050	Naw, kitten, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
AID00135051	Never mind.
AID00135052	Whatever.
AID00135053	What's "the magic?"
AID00135054	Okay then, what do you make?
AID00135055	We make the happy stuff. What do you need? Jet, Psycho, a little Med-X to ease the pain?
AID00135056	What do you think about Caesar?
AID00135057	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AID00135058	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AID00135059	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AID00135060	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AID00135061	Well, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
AID00135062	Papa hasn't steered us wrong yet.
AID00135063	Tell me a little about the Great Khans.
AID00135064	They're family, you dig? They've always looked out for us, made sure we had something to eat and a place to crash.
AID00135065	Papa may look like a big angry bear, but he's a softie at heart. Regis is cool - scary, but cool. The rest are all pretty groovy, even little Jerry.
AID00135066	I'll spare you the history lesson - talk to Papa Khan if you want to hear that story.
AID00135067	Things have been rough for a while now, even with Jack working all the time and my runners making deliveries daily we're barely getting by.
AID00135068	Maybe this alliance with Caesar will help, but I don't know.
AID00135069	What is it you do here?
AID00135070	Do? We don't, like, do anything. We make the magic happen.
AID00135071	We keep the Great Khans from falling apart, essentially. Jack manufactures the chems, I organize the runners and the shipments.
AID00135072	What kind of doubts?
AID00135073	I just don't trust the words of Caesar's ambassador that much. He's promising a lot, and I don't see the advantage for him. It makes me suspicious.
AID00135074	Never mind, I have other questions.
AID00135075	Sure, go ahead.
AID00135076	Tell me about Bitter Springs.
AID00135077	I really don't like to talk about it. Let's just say it was a tragedy and the NCR is to blame, and we'll leave it at that.
AID00135078	What did you mean about Papa's hatred poisoning his mind?
AID00135079	Nothing, forget about it. I shouldn't be talking about this with an outsider.
AID00135080	I probably shouldn't say anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
AID00135081	This alliance with Caesar, for one thing - I have my doubts about it.
AID00135082	That's horrible!
AID00135083	It's because of that that we have sworn to take revenge on the NCR. With our new allies in Caesar's Legion, we will crush them!
AID00135084	That doesn't sound like something the NCR would order.
AID00135085	Oh, they claimed it was a miscommunication, but tell that to those who saw our families butchered. Tell it to the survivors who were banished here.
AID00135086	What happened at Bitter Springs?
AID00135087	When the NCR came to the Mojave, we thought they would be easy pickings. We raided their caravans, their towns, their camps - they couldn't stop us.
AID00135088	At least, that's what we thought. They tracked us to Bitter Springs and surrounded us.
AID00135089	When our children, our sick and old, fled through a nearby pass, the NCR gunned them down.
AID00135090	How did the Three Families defeat you?
AID00135091	They allied with Mr. House, the self-proclaimed master of New Vegas. He supported them with the resources of New Vegas: weapons, technology, caps.
AID00135092	They were better equipped, and we could not stand against them.
AID00135093	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
AID00135094	Typical. No reverence for history in the younger generations.
AID00135095	Maybe you could give me the short version.
AID00135096	In a hurry, are you? Very well then: The Great Khans came east out of the NCR 14 years ago. We ruled the Wastes, then, and called no man master.
AID00135097	But we underestimated the Families of the Strip, and they drove us back to Bitter Springs, where we remained until the NCR arrived and drove us here.
AID00135098	I had some other questions.
AID00135099	Speak, then.
AID00135100	What does the Legion want with the Great Khans?
AID00135101	Though they have been cruelly oppressed by the NCR, the Khans remain great warriors. The Legion is honored to have such allies in battle.
AID00135102	What's your role in Caesar's Legion?
AID00135103	I am one of the frumentarii: it is my duty to scout the Wastes in Caesar's name and make contact with any tribes that might serve a useful purpose.
AID00135104	You might say I'm somewhere between a scout and an ambassador. I'm assigned here as part of the alliance between the Legion and the Great Khans.
AID00135105	What alliance?
AID00135106	In exchange for great Caesar's promise of all the lands west of New Vegas, the Khans have agreed to fight alongside the Legion when the time comes.

AID00135109	What if I destroy all three?
AID00135110	The bunker will be destroyed, and you'll die instantly.
AID00135111	Caesar will kill me unless he believes I blew something up down here.
AID00135112	I see - you're in a predicament.
AID00135113	Just off the turbine room down below are three power regulators. It's a redundant system - only one is needed.
AID00135114	Go ahead and destroy one. The explosion will be large enough to be heard and felt aboveground.
AID00135115	Nope, I'm going to blow it all up anyways.
AID00135116	Then there will be no safe haven for you.
AID00135117	I'll upload the data, as you ask.
AID00135118	I'm going to do as Caesar asks and blow everything up down here.
AID00135119	Listen to me, very carefully. I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on a lark.
AID00135120	Do as I say, and your rewards will be immense. Thwart me, and your punishment will become the purpose of my existence.
AID00135121	What was that you said about security systems?
AID00135122	The same equipment failure that prevents me from remotely operating this facility seems to have activated its security robots and turrets.
AID00135123	There's a security room near the base of the stairs... perhaps you can deactivate them yourself.
AID00135124	What will you do with your Securitrons?
AID00135125	My army will do what an army does best - defend territory from invaders... and maintain order.
AID00135126	Caesar wants me to destroy this place.
AID00135127	What are you doing here?
AID00135128	It is obvious to you that I built this place? The Platinum Chip opened it, after all?
AID00135129	In any case, you're here. So let's get to it.
AID00135130	Goodbye means goodbye.
AID00135131	I've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
AID00135132	I can't reach through this monitor and compell you to follow instructions, but know this - if you disappoint me, you will pay for it.
AID00135133	Goodbye.
AID00135134	What did you say this place was, again?
AID00135135	Goodbye.
AID00135136	Goodbye.
AID00135137	Goodbye? Is that some kind of joke? You barely understand what I want you to accomplish down there.
AID00135138	What is this place?
AID00135139	Who are you exactly?
AID00135140	What are you asking me to do?
AID00135141	You're asking me to commit suicide. The Legion will attack me on sight.
AID00135142	Then gather together the firepower or explosives or whatever else you need and improvise.
AID00135143	I don't care if you have to kill every Legionary at the Fort. Get the job done.
AID00135144	I'll do as you say.
AID00135145	That would make for a welcome change.
AID00135146	<Lie> I'm not sure what happened to it.
AID00135147	Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
AID00135148	The Legion took it from me at the Fort.
AID00135149	So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
AID00135150	Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
AID00135151	Caesar will kill me unless he believes I blew something up down here.
AID00135152	We'll see what happens.
AID00135153	I like to think you have enough sense to do the right thing. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.
AID00135154	I'll upload the data, as you ask.
AID00135155	Good. I won't hold you up any longer.
AID00135156	<Use Barter to negotiate for higher reward.>
AID00135157	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, you'll receive a nice bonus when the work is done. And speaking of getting it done...
AID00135158	This work sounds important - and expensive.
AID00135159	[FAILED] You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, and you'll be paid when the delivery is made.
AID00135160	I could use a raise!
AID00135161	Maybe I should destroy everything down here.
AID00135162	I don't respond well to threats. Now, where were we...?
AID00135163	What do you want me to do?
AID00135164	Caesar wants me to destroy this place.
AID00135165	Was that meant to be a shocking revelation? Of course Caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
AID00135166	But you're not going to do that. You're going to do the smart thing, and work for me.
AID00135167	What is this place?
AID00135168	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
AID00135169	What is this place?
AID00135170	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a kind of barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
AID00135171	Why did you send me here?
AID00135172	Who are you, exactly?
AID00135173	Surely you know that I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
AID00135174	I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
AID00135175	You wanted me to come down here?
AID00135176	That's rather obvious, isn't it?
AID00135177	What makes you think Caesar gave me the Chip?
AID00135178	The Platinum Chip unlocks this bunker. Hence, you have it.
AID00135179	Hence, Benny was captured or killed - possibly by you, but by my estimates, far more probably by Caesar's Legion. Hence, Caesar gave you the Chip.
AID00135180	Hence, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
AID00135181	That you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the Fort is a certainty. And as the Chip is a little too large to be secreted away...
AID00135182	I also regard it a certainty that the Chip was discovered, taken from you, and given to Caesar - who returned it to you.
AID00135183	Two plus two equaling four, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
AID00135184	But that's not going to happen, because you're going to work for me.
AID00135185	<Ask Mr. House why the place doesn't seem to have any power.>
AID00135186	You're the only one who can make this decision.
AID00135187	Not even a hint, huh? Geez, I really am all alone on this one.
AID00135188	I guess I'll stay. If I left there wouldn't be any coming back. It might be something I'd instantly regret.
AID00135189	Things are going to get harder for the Brotherhood before they get easier. I should support them in whatever way I can.
AID00135190	Leaving now is your only shot at a future.
AID00135191	There's no getting around that, is there? What would my life be like here, knowing what's to come?
AID00135192	They're not going to like this. We're given a chance when we're young to choose whether to stay. If we do, it's supposed to be for life.
AID00135193	But they haven't left me any choice. It's this or a lifetime of scavenging and watching my friends die in losing battles. I guess it's settled, then.
AID00135194	This is your home, and these are your friends. You should stay.
AID00135195	They may be a bunch of wooden conformists, but anything I did without them would feel... empty.
AID00135196	I'd always be reminded of this day. How I wasn't strong enough to stand by them.
AID00135197	So I guess I'll stay. Won't be easy, but at least I won't feel guilty about the choice.
AID00135198	Let's get going. I'd like to get my mind off all this. And some fresh air would do me some good right about now.
AID00135199	You should take over.
AID00135200	Ha! Well that's... imaginative. But it's not really for me.
AID00135201	I couldn't get one of their most reasonable members to accept a rational argument. I don't see them coming out in droves to support my coup.
AID00135202	And that's really not what the Brotherhood needs right now anyway. They're hanging by a thread.
AID00135203	Where does that leave you?
AID00135204	I... I don't know if I can stay. Maybe it'd be better for everyone if I left. Spent my life... somewhere else.
AID00135205	Work with the Followers of the Apocalypse, maybe. Put my knowledge to some good use.
AID00135206	Or I can stay here with the people I care about and do... whatever I can, until it comes to a slow or sudden end.
AID00135207	Would someone else listen to you?
AID00135208	It wouldn't matter. The Elder has final say.
AID00135209	The hell of it is he's one of our most progressive members. If I can't get him to agree, it's hopeless.
AID00135210	He won't tolerate any resistance. If he catches wind I've been talking to people, he'll charge me with sedition.
AID00135211	You just weren't very persuasive.
AID00135212	Well I knew he wouldn't listen to me. That's why we went out of our way to find something that he couldn't ignore.
AID00135213	But it didn't make any difference.
AID00135214	How can I help them when they won't accept it?
AID00135215	Maybe if we make a stronger case, he'll change his mind.
AID00135216	No. Our case wouldn't be any stronger if tomorrow they all died when their energy weapons backfired.
AID00135217	I just didn't expect that. There was no getting through to him.
AID00135218	There was never any chance. His mind was made up from the start.
AID00135219	I see that now. I thought I knew him better than that. But it was like talking to a stranger.
AID00135220	VMS49ElderDiscussion2Conclusion
AID00135221	What does the Codex say?
AID00135222	The Codex is clear on this. It's-
AID00135223	A bunch of closed-minded bullshit.
AID00135224	We do not help them, or let them in.
AID00135225	It says they can't be trusted.
AID00135226	But-
AID00135227	We keep knowledge they must never have.
AID00135228	It says that we are to protect humanity from them at all costs.
AID00135229	Give it a chance. For me. I can't stay here and watch us waste away.
AID00135230	I'm sorry.
AID00135231	I can't.
AID00135232	We'll die out.
AID00135233	<Sighs> I know.
AID00135234	Then we will accept that fate with honor.
AID00135235	Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.
AID00135236	VMS49ElderDiscussion2HELIOS
AID00135237	We unlocked the secret of HELIOS One.
AID00135238	What? Wonderful news!
AID00135239	Then we have a game-changing weapon.
AID00135240	No. It's not. ARCHIMEDES II is an orbital laser. Effective only outdoors in a limited radius and requiring a long recharge.
AID00135241	In the hands of the enemy-
AID00135242	It was worth keeping from our enemies. If they had it-
AID00135243	They'd be marginally more effective. We lost most of the chapter defending glorified artillery.
AID00135244	We couldn't have known. We fought for what we believed in.
AID00135245	We did as the Codex dictated.
AID00135246	And nearly died for it. Tomorrow you'd do it all over again, having learned nothing.
AID00135247	Are you trying to shame me?
AID00135248	How dare you insult the honor of the brothers and sisters who died there!
AID00135249	I'm trying to open your eyes.
AID00135250	We need to engage the outside world. We can't win without new recruits.
AID00135251	VMS49ElderDiscussion2V34
AID00135252	We found a gun that disables power armor. One of these could defeat the whole Brotherhood.
AID00135253	We have to stop limiting our focus to military technology. It won't save us.
AID00135254	That could be the only one of its kind.
AID00135255	Then it's a good thing this weapon has fallen into the right hands.
AID00135256	That's not the point. Technology won't win our wars. We need numbers. New recruits.
AID00135257	VMS49ElderDiscussion2V22
AID00135258	This disk has secrets to breeding plants that can thrive in the wasteland.
AID00135259	High Elder Maxson didn't found us to be botanists, Veronica.
AID00135260	I'm waiting to hear why this deserves our attention.
AID00135261	Think about it. No more trading guns for food. Total self-sufficiency. It's what we always wanted.
AID00135262	This won't get us Hoover Dam.
AID00135263	This won't defeat our enemies.
AID00135264	Yes it will. If we feed people, they'll support us. They'll join us.
AID00135265	VMS49ElderDiscussion2Intro
AID00135266	Veronica. I hope-
AID00135267	Shouldn't you be securing supplies for us?
AID00135268	I brought you a present.
AID00135269	My friend is part of a group that can develop it into something safe everyone can benefit from.
AID00135270	I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
AID00135271	I'd like the regenerating ability.
AID00135272	That's the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder. The implant speeds up cell regeneration, an effect similar to that of some lizards and sea creatures.
AID00135273	The implant is very expensive, however - 12,000 caps.
AID00135274	I'm interested in the sub-dermal implant.
AID00135275	That would be the NEMEAN Sub-Dermal Armor. It's a bit pricey - 8,000 caps - but the implant causes your skin cells to be bolstered with iron.
AID00135276	It won't make you bulletproof, but it will make you a little harder to injure.
AID00135277	Boost my charisma.
AID00135278	You're already quite charming. The Empathy Synthesizer would just be a waste of caps, I'm afraid.
AID00135279	The Empathy Synthesizer will allow you to more easily pick up on subtle emotions and body language. The price is 4,000 caps.
AID00135280	I want to buy an implant.
AID00135281	One other thing I forgot to mention - your body may be able to handle only a limited number of implants.
AID00135282	The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
AID00135283	Which surgery option are you considering?
AID00135284	There aren't any more implants I can give you - you've already bought everything I had available.
AID00135285	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
AID00135286	All right, you're healthy enough to handle another one. Which surgery are you considering?
AID00135287	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
AID00135288	I'm afraid you can't handle any more implants right now. Your body isn't durable enough to take it. Sorry.
AID00135289	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold to you?
AID00135290	Antique rangefinder? I'm trying to think of something that'd be more worthless.
AID00135291	Maybe an antique horoscope. Or an antique sandwich.
AID00135292	I'll tell you something. Good luck finding that thing. But if you do find it, don't waste your time trying to sell it to me.
AID00135293	Never mind.
AID00135294	Very well.
AID00135295	Here's the caps.
AID00135296	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135297	We fight for ourselves. Bring our warriors to the battle and kill everyone.
AID00135298	As you wish, chieftain.
AID00135299	I'm giving leadership to you. I want you to take the tribe north, and find yourselves a new life.
AID00135300	I... very well. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do.
AID00135301	I'll start the preparations and we'll leave when the NCR is distracted by Caesar's attack.
AID00135302	We fight for the NCR.
AID00135303	As you wish. When the Republic goes to war, we go with it.
AID00135304	We fight for Caesar.
AID00135305	As you wish. When Caesar goes to war, we go with him.
AID00135306	I don't want that kind of responsibility.
AID00135307	Then when I die, you can pass control of the Great Khans on to Regis. For now you are my heir, and will be accorded the honor of that position.
AID00135308	This is a great honor. I don't know what to say.
AID00135309	You don't have to say anything - I am Papa Khan, and I have spoken. When I'm gone, you will lead the tribe.
AID00135310	Forget it, I'm not interested.
AID00135311	That's too bad. I hope you'll change your mind.
AID00135312	Okay, I'll go visit him as soon as I can.
AID00135313	Excellent. I'll let him know you're coming. Good luck out there.
AID00135314	What's this about?
AID00135315	He didn't say, but it sounded very important.
AID00135316	GreatKhanMessengerPapa
AID00135317	I've got a message for you from Papa Khan. He wants you to return to Red Rock Canyon and speak to him as soon as possible.
AID00135318	The Followers have agreed to take you on as a member. Head to the Old Mormon Fort.
AID00135319	They did? That's great! Thank you! I'm out of this crummy camp!
AID00135320	None whatsoever.
AID00135321	Ah. Well... I suppose we could always find him a place. Maybe doing inventory on the Pre-War Unexploded Munitions Collection back West.
AID00135322	All right, tell the boy to report here, he can leave on the next caravan.
AID00135323	He's obviously a bright, sensitive soul, and he loves literature.
AID00135324	Excellent! Ezekiel's been after me to find him a new assistant for ages. Tell the boy we'll take him.
AID00135325	Well, he's a poet. Kind of.
AID00135326	Hmm. Well, I suppose we could always use another junior archivist in the library. All right, tell him we'll accept him as a probationary initiate.
AID00135327	I met a kid who's unsatisfied with life in the Great Khans. Will you take him on as a Follower?
AID00135328	We're always looking for new members. Does he have any particular talent?
AID00135329	I had some other questions.
AID00135330	What does it take to join the Great Khans?
AID00135331	How does the initiation work?
AID00135332	What is this place?
AID00135333	What do you know about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00135334	Not much. They found us when we came to the Mojave, gave us a bunch of books on science and history - I guess they're like teachers or something?
AID00135335	That's not really my problem, is it?
AID00135336	No, I suppose not.
AID00135337	Probably. You seem like their type.
AID00135338	You think so? I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
AID00135339	Why don't you go there and find out?
AID00135340	I don't know. I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
AID00135341	I could ask them for you.
AID00135342	You'd do that? Thanks! I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
AID00135343	Why isn't poetry "Great Khan-like?"
AID00135344	Have you seen this tribe? If it's not an epic drunken ballad of cracking skulls and hearing lamentations they think it's a waste of time.
AID00135345	I had some other questions, actually.
AID00135346	Sure, okay.
AID00135347	You don't sound too eager for your initiation.
AID00135348	Yeah, well, I guess maybe I'm not. But what else can I do?
AID00135349	It sounded like you were writing poetry.
AID00135350	Oh. You heard that, huh? Okay, so yeah, I was writing poetry. I know, I know, it's not a very Great Khan-like thing to do.
AID00135351	The Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp when I was a kid, and they brought a bunch of old books. I used to read pre-War poetry for hours.
AID00135352	I'd like to hear some of your poetry.
AID00135353	You would? Really? Okay, well then, here goes:
AID00135354	This one's a haiku.
AID00135355	Radscorpion bites,
AID00135356	my foot in the box canyon.
AID00135357	Ow, ow, ow, ow... ow.
AID00135358	I wrote this limerick the last time I went to Freeside.
AID00135359	There once was a fellow called Garret,
AID00135360	whose sister she did love to bare it.
AID00135361	She flashed it around, all over town,
AID00135362	so if you would screw her, beware it.
AID00135363	I, uh, got kicked out of the Atomic Wrangler for that one.
AID00135364	This is a poem I wrote about the dark loneliness that suffuses my soul.
AID00135365	Rainclouds wrap my heart in sorrow black as silk,
AID00135366	My empty scream does not echo, even though we're in a canyon.
AID00135367	My soul aches, but not as much as my limbs, because I've been beaten severely.
AID00135368	Here's one about the girl I love.
AID00135369	Her hair stands tall, like the spiky bits on a Deathclaw.
AID00135370	Her eyes are bright as radioactive sludge, glowing with the light of love.
AID00135371	But when I talk to her, she laughs and mocks and has her brothers beat me.
AID00135372	Oh, why do nice girls hate me?
AID00135373	That's it. What do you think?
AID00135374	What do you think about the Khans' alliance with Caesar?
AID00135375	Huh? Wait, what are you talking about? We're allied with Caesar now? Psh. Typical. Nobody tells me anything.
AID00135376	Can you tell me about the Great Khans?
AID00135377	I can tell you they're a bunch of big dumb jerks with no appreciation for art. I mean, can you believe their initiation?
AID00135378	What are you doing?
AID00135379	Oh, nothing really. Just trying to psych myself up to try my initiation. Again. Raaaar!
AID00135380	What did he look like?
AID00135381	Oh he was pretty average, I'd say. Average height, average age. Dark hair. Beard of some kind.
AID00135382	What'd you tell him?
AID00135383	I said I didn't know about anything like that around here. But if he wanted to live for free, a lot of people do that in Freeside.
AID00135384	I know there's a concrete building there across from Mick and Ralph's. No ceiling, but I think it still counts.
AID00135385	Went up there one time to try and... you know... meet my neighbors in the biz. But you know, I don't think they took me very seriously.
AID00135386	Did you happen to find out where he was from?
AID00135387	No, but I know where he was going. He asked me if I knew of any place where he could hide out for a while.
AID00135388	Wanted somewhere with concrete walls. Something about airwaves. I forget.
AID00135389	But I guess he spent all his money on the rangefinder, because he said it had to be somewhere free to stay.
AID00135390	What kind of collar?
AID00135391	Well it was metal, and kind of thick. At first I thought he'd come from Gomorrah, but they're more into leather there.
AID00135392	Didn't look comfortable. He kept reaching up like he was gonna itch it, but he always stopped himself.
AID00135393	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold you.
AID00135394	Wow, I wish I had more of them. All this interest. It'd be my biggest seller.
AID00135395	I sold it to a man not too long ago. Real twitchy, nervous sort of guy. Kinda seemed like he was wiggin' out about something.
AID00135396	Had a funny collar on. I wanted to ask him about it but I figured maybe I'd regret asking. People are weird around here.
AID00135397	What killed the other troopers?
AID00135398	I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
AID00135399	I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
AID00135400	Goodbye.
AID00135401	Here's the caps.
AID00135402	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135403	Here's the caps.
AID00135404	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135405	I don't have the caps right now.
AID00135406	That's all right.
AID00135407	VHDLegateCongratulatesYou
AID00135408	This slaughter pleases me. No act is more sacred than consecrating a site in the blood of one's enemies.
AID00135409	The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
AID00135410	With their commander dead, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
AID00135411	Judging by the lack of blood, I take it the coward Oliver fled rather than face me. No matter.
AID00135412	The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
AID00135413	With their commander gone, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
AID00135414	The Legion will swell with the number of slaves we will claim from this place, and the tribute we gather will fund further campaigns.
AID00135415	Perhaps, in time, I will be granted the honor of conquering the land known as California. But for now, we rest.
AID00135416	Know that your efforts are appreciated and will not go unrewarded. But we can speak of that later.
AID00135417	For now, come, we must see to the burning of the dead.
AID00135418	Then choose, general. Leave now and your men will live. Stay, and you all die.
AID00135419	We choose to stay, though I think we'll all debate you on the dying part.
AID00135420	I suppose there's no point in remaining here any longer. Very well, my men and I will leave.
AID00135421	Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
AID00135422	
AID00135423	[SUCCEEDED] Y-You're right. These men have placed their lives in my hands, and I won't throw them away for a lost cause.
AID00135424	Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
AID00135425	The dam is already lost, general. Your responsibility now is to get your men out of here alive.
AID00135426	[FAILED] It sure as hell is. Aside from being an important source of power and water, it's a symbol of hope.
AID00135427	Though I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.
AID00135428	Is this dam really that important? Really?
AID00135429	Then I guess we fight.
AID00135430	Dying won't accomplish anything.
AID00135431	It will see that our orders are carried through to the end. That's what good soldiers do.
AID00135432	Then let's fight already.
AID00135433	And what about your duty to your men?
AID00135434	My men and I are soldiers. We share an obligation to follow orders. And our orders are to hold this dam.
AID00135435	Very clever, general. But I already know you have an escape route.
AID00135436	
AID00135437	[SUCCEEDED] Perhaps I do have a secret tunnel out of here. But that doesn't change anything. My duty is to stay and fight.
AID00135438	I'm betting a man as smart as you wouldn't leave himself without at least one contingency.
AID00135439	[FAILED] Even if we hadn't blocked the river to prevent the Legion from coming at us from the south, that'd be absurd.
AID00135440	Caesar's forces are arrayed all along the eastern bank. We'd be under fire the whole way.
AID00135441	You could head down the river, take a boat or something.
AID00135442	You're right. I guess you're screwed.
AID00135443	Then let's get this over with.
AID00135444	To what end? You delay the inevitable.
AID00135445	Better that than simply give up. What other option is available? Retreat?
AID00135446	Then let's stop wasting time, shall we?
AID00135447	My thoughts exactly.
AID00135448	There's still time. You could escape. I won't stop you.
AID00135449	And go where? According to you, the road west is blocked. And while you might let us by, I highly doubt your allies will do the same.
AID00135450	The Legion has more men on their way as well.
AID00135451	Do you really think your ragtag band of slavers has more manpower than the armed forces of the NCR?
AID00135452	I'd pit one of my men against two of your cutthroats any day. Backed by additional troops, we'll mop the floor with your pathetic Legion.
AID00135453	There won't be any reinforcements. The Legion has blocked the road west.
AID00135454	If that's true, then there's nothing else for it. My men and I will hold out as long as we can.
AID00135455	Then I guess I'd better kill you before that happens.
AID00135456	This doesn't have to end in bloodshed, general.
AID00135457	The army of bloodthirsty maniacs with you would disagree. No, I think I'll hold the fort here until our reinforcements arrive.
AID00135458	That's exactly why I'm here, General Oliver.
AID00135459	Fool! We've fortified this place to hold out indefinitely against an army. What chance do you think you have?
AID00135460	Can I ask you something else?
AID00135461	Okay.
AID00135462	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
AID00135463	Alright, I'll do it.
AID00135464	Can I ask you something else first?
AID00135465	Okay.
AID00135466	I have to think about this first.
AID00135467	Understandable. Let me know when you've decided.
AID00135468	Can I ask you something else?
AID00135469	Sure.
AID00135470	How did you survive the attack?
AID00135471	Can I ask you something else?
AID00135472	Sure.
AID00135473	How did the Legion get into the camp?
AID00135474	Can I ask you something else?
AID00135475	Sure.
AID00135476	Sorry, my mistake, I'm still in.
AID00135477	Damn right it is. Now let's get going.
AID00135478	Then get your ass back into town before talking to me. I wanna know you're serious about this.
AID00135479	Nope, I'm getting out of here.
AID00135480	Look, I'm not leaving this place 'til I have what I came for. I'll be in the storage basement if you change your mind.
AID00135481	Goodbye.
AID00135482	Stay safe.
AID00135483	Goodbye.
AID00135484	VHDIntakeTowerCenturionThanks
AID00135485	Thank Mars. The assault can resume.
AID00135486	Just make sure your men don't get in my way.
AID00135487	Ha ha, Mars favors the bold, does he not?
AID00135488	I'll make my way across somehow.
AID00135489	Then I wish you luck, and good hunting.
AID00135490	I'll see what I can do.
AID00135491	Any assistance you can provide is welcome, and will mean more of our men to carve through the foe by your side.
AID00135492	How did you get here ahead of me?
AID00135493	My contubernium came up through one of the intake towers ahead and headed east, taking the NCR fools unawares from behind.
AID00135494	Their confusion allowed us to slaughter them like brahmin calves. Unfortunately, my brothers heading west did not fare as well.
AID00135495	The area is secure.
AID00135496	Good news, indeed. If only the same could be said for the west.
AID00135497	The enemy is much more fortified ahead, and have snipers set up at key positions, which keep our men pinned down.
AID00135498	In addition, they've managed to beat back our men emerging from the intake tower ahead and secure it.
AID00135499	If we could just get rid of those damn snipers, or release our waiting men in the intake tower, we'd have the manpower to storm their positions.
AID00135500	There's still some fighting back there.
AID00135501	And yet you managed to slip past. Impressive. You may not find the fighting to the west quite so easy to get around, however.
AID00135502	Goodbye.
AID00135503	I don't have the caps right now.
AID00135504	That's all right.
AID00135505	Here's the caps.
AID00135506	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135507	I don't have the caps right now.
AID00135508	That's all right.
AID00135509	Here's the caps.
AID00135510	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135511	Never mind.
AID00135512	Of course.
AID00135513	I don't have the caps right now.
AID00135514	No need to apologize.
AID00135515	Here's 500 caps.
AID00135516	Very much appreciated. These caps will go towards funding schools and other services to the poorer part of the community.
AID00135517	Do the Followers have a headquarters around here?
AID00135518	Yes, the Mormon Fort in Freeside. It's hard to miss.
AID00135519	Are the Followers part of the NCR?
AID00135520	We've worked with them in the past. The NCR became too focused on things like patents and profitability, so the Followers go their own way now.
AID00135521	The NCR and the Followers have a cool relationship at the moment. We see them as oppressive, and they view us as anarchists.
AID00135522	What do the Followers believe in?
AID00135523	We believe that technology for basic necessities, like food, water, and medicine, should be shared, not hoarded.
AID00135524	We're also strongly in favor of proper education. I've come across more than a few "doctors" whose techniques came out of the back of a magazine.
AID00135525	Can I make a donation to the Followers?
AID00135526	Of course! We prefer bulk donations of 500 caps - it's apparently a lot easier on the accountants, for some reason.
AID00135527	Are you one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00135528	Yes, I am. I received my medical training at the Angel's Boneyard Medical University back in the NCR.
AID00135529	It's not a requirement to be a Follower to enter the university, but I believe in what they do, so I joined them.
AID00135530	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135531	All right.
AID00135532	Tell me about the clinic.
AID00135533	Everything you see is funded by the Followers of the Apocalypse. We rely a lot on charity to provide low-cost medical services to the less fortunate.
AID00135534	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00135535	Because you're a friend of the Followers, I can give you a bit of a discount.
AID00135536	Very well.
AID00135537	Do you sell anything here?
AID00135538	I have reserved a small part of my supplies for sale. The profits go directly to the purchase of additional supplies to help the less fortunate.
AID00135539	I don't have the caps.
AID00135540	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AID00135541	Here's the caps.
AID00135542	All right, this will only take a few minutes.
AID00135543	I don't have the caps.
AID00135544	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AID00135545	I don't have the caps.
AID00135546	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AID00135547	Here's the caps.
AID00135548	All right. Sit still and let me work.
AID00135549	Here's the caps.
AID00135550	All right. Sit still and let me work.
AID00135551	I don't have the caps.
AID00135552	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AID00135553	Here's the caps.
AID00135554	All right. Sit still and let me work.
AID00135555	Here's the caps.
AID00135556	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135557	Here's the caps.
AID00135558	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135559	Here's the caps.
AID00135560	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135561	Here's the caps.
AID00135562	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135563	Can you make me luckier?
AID00135564	Huh. I've never seen a coin toss go someone's way that many times. You certainly don't need the help of a Probability Calculator implant.
AID00135565	If fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
AID00135566	If I implant the Probability Calculator in your frontal lobe, you'll be able to calculate odds a little better.
AID00135567	It's not quite the same as making you luckier, but you'll be able to nudge things your way more often. I can do the implant for 4000 caps.
AID00135568	Here's the caps.
AID00135569	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
AID00135570	I have the Gun Runner holotape.
AID00135571	The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll like be aware of the theft soon enough.
AID00135572	This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
AID00135573	The Gun Runners will be looking for revenge for the murder of their people. I won't sell you out, but be careful out there.
AID00135574	We'll be unable to make use of their schematics any time soon. Not what I was hoping for when I asked you to do the job. Take your pay.
AID00135575	I hear it's business as usual at the Gun Runners, as if nothing unusual happened. Excellent work.
AID00135576	We'll be able to use the schematics you acquired to begin manufacturing our own weapons immediately. We'll provide some to you at a discount.
AID00135577	Cassidy Caravans has been bought out, and is now part of the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00135578	Very good. On occasion it's proven to be more profitable in the long run to simply buy out the competition, and this is one of those occasions.
AID00135579	The Crimson Caravan Company no longer has to worry about Henry Jamison.
AID00135580	Yes, I'd heard something about his untimely death. There will be a lot of questions from his family, so I trust you had nothing to do with this.
AID00135581	I guess the one bright spot is that I can strike his name from the payroll after all.
AID00135582	Yes, but at significant cost. I understand that you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
AID00135583	I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
AID00135584	Yes, I understand that he's decided to quit outright and not even ask for compensation. I'm a bit curious what exactly you said to him.
AID00135585	Then again, perhaps I'd rather not know. Thank you all the same - I'm very happy to be rid of that man.
AID00135586	Yes, I heard. I believe we're now responsible for paying off his gambling debts, but that you bargained him down from a more outrageous demand.
AID00135587	Well done. I'm very pleased to be rid of that man.
AID00135588	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135589	All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
AID00135590	You're well-dressed for this place.
AID00135591	Normally, I oversee company operations at the Hub in California. However, the New Vegas branch has been underperforming in recent years.
AID00135592	Given the conditions here, it's not hard to see why. I'll change all that, soon enough.
AID00135593	Does the Crimson Caravan have any competition?
AID00135594	Well, the Gun Runners continue to dominate the weapons market, and the Mormon traders from New Canaan control the majority of the northern routes.
AID00135595	How long have you been in business?
AID00135596	The Crimson Caravan Company has been in business for over 130 years. We're partially responsible for the progress in the NCR.
AID00135597	I'd like to know more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00135598	Certainly. What would you like to know?
AID00135599	What other work do you have available?
AID00135600	As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
AID00135601	There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
AID00135602	There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
AID00135603	And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runner's manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
AID00135604	I delivered the invoice, just as you asked.
AID00135605	Well, you've proven yourself reliable so far. Would you be interested in more important jobs?
AID00135606	Actually, I don't have time for this right now.
AID00135607	I see. Was there anything else, then?
AID00135608	I'll take it. What do I need to do?
AID00135609	Deliver this invoice to Dr. Hildern. You can find him somewhere inside Camp McCarran.
AID00135610	I'm looking for work.
AID00135611	I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravaneers or guards, but I'm in need of a runner.
AID00135612	Goodbye.
AID00135613	It's been a pleasure.
AID00135614	Goodbye.
AID00135615	<Secondary factions>
AID00135616	Who do you think will win - the NCR or Caesar's Legion?
AID00135617	What was Vegas like before the war?
AID00135618	It was a place of splendor. As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas.
AID00135619	I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
AID00135620	By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it.
AID00135621	I knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
AID00135622	I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
AID00135623	You say that you saved Las Vegas. How?
AID00135624	On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas.
AID00135625	My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact.
AID00135626	Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself.
AID00135627	A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...
AID00135628	What preparations did you make to save Las Vegas?
AID00135629	The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War.
AID00135630	It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended.
AID00135631	The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too.
AID00135632	Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.
AID00135633	Why didn't the Platinum Chip arrive on time?
AID00135634	Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down.
AID00135635	For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS.
AID00135636	I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
AID00135637	How did you nearly die, defending Vegas?
AID00135638	I want to know more about you, Mr. House.
AID00135639	<Tell House about Benny's fate at fort>
AID00135640	Not interested.
AID00135641	Not interested? Not interested?
AID00135642	You have an interest in this even if you're too stupid to know it. If you have an interest in breathing, you have an interest in this.
AID00135643	Return to the Fort and do whatever it takes to recover the Chip.
AID00135644	What brought you to New Vegas?
AID00135645	I wanted to be where the action is, so I got my dad to pull some strings and get me a cushy position with the Crimson Caravan.
AID00135646	Everything was great until McLafferty came along. That old bitch is gonna hear about it from my dad, just you wait.
AID00135647	Fine. I'll let McLafferty know we've struck a deal.
AID00135648	You do that. And tell the old bitch to pay up quick, you hear?
AID00135649	Never mind.
AID00135650	We done, then?
AID00135651	< Speech 50 >
AID00135652	[SUCCEEDED] Wha-? No, no wait. Look, I just need time. Don't rat me out to them.
AID00135653	You want me to quit the Crimson Caravan? Fine, I quit. You can tell McLafferty that she won't see my face again.
AID00135654	So you don't have the Omertas' money yet? I'll let them know about that.
AID00135655	[FAILED] As if they'd even talk to you. You're nobody. I'm Henry-fucking-Jamison.
AID00135656	I'll go talk to the Omertas about you, then. Unless you feel like quitting?
AID00135657	< Barter 50 >
AID00135658	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, whatever. Forget the severance. Just get the Omertas off my back, and you can tell McLafferty she won't see my face again.
AID00135659	The better deal would be for me to walk away and let the Omertas handle you.
AID00135660	[FAILED] Tough shit. That's what I want, or I'm not going anywhere.
AID00135661	What? No way. Pay off the Omertas, sure, but you don't get a single cap more.
AID00135662	Maybe we can make a deal. What do you want from the Crimson Caravan in exchange for quitting?
AID00135663	I want my debt with the Omertas paid off. And I want one of those severance package things. A big one.
AID00135664	My terms are the same as before. They pay off my debt to the Omertas, and I get a big fucking severance package.
AID00135665	What do you know about the Omertas?
AID00135666	One of the families that runs the Strip. They're a pack of cheaters, but you still don't want to fuck with them.
AID00135667	Goodbye.
AID00135668	Yeah, whatever.
AID00135669	I'm here to talk about ending your employment with the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00135670	Fuck no. No matter what that old bitch McLafferty says, my dad said I could be in charge of the New Vegas branch.
AID00135671	Besides, I got into a little money trouble with the Omertas. If I quit the Crimson Caravan, how am I supposed to get the money to gamble?
AID00135672	You'll have to find someone else for the Gun Runner job. That's not something I do.
AID00135673	I understand. No hard feelings, but you will, of course, keep our conversation on the matter strictly confidential.
AID00135674	I need to be reminded about a job you wanted me to do.
AID00135675	Of course. Which one?
AID00135676	Very well. What job did you need more information on?
AID00135677	I'll see what I can do.
AID00135678	Thank you. Was there something else?
AID00135679	What's the Gun Runner job about?
AID00135680	The quality of the Gun Runners' armaments is due to their manufacturing process. They craft all weapons on-site.
AID00135681	I want to know the secrets of their manufacturing process, which means you'll need to find some way to get inside their heavily-guarded factory.
AID00135682	I would greatly prefer that you perform this job undetected and without killing anyone, if it can be helped.
AID00135683	I want to know more about the problem with Henry Jamison.
AID00135684	The Jamisons are very wealthy ranchers back in Redding, California and significant investors in the Crimson Caravan Company.
AID00135685	I was pressured into posting young Henry as the manager of the New Vegas branch. As you can see, he wasn't exactly cut out for the job.
AID00135686	He was much more interested in gambling and prostitutes, and because of his family, I can't simply fire him.
AID00135687	Henry needs to be convinced to quit, one way or another. I won't have a useless employee on the company payroll.
AID00135688	Tell me about the negotiation.
AID00135689	There's a small trading outfit, Cassidy Caravans, that I'm interested in acquiring. They've been rather competitive, so it's time to buy them out.
AID00135690	I have it on good authority that the owner, Cass, wants out of the caravan business.
AID00135691	Cass frequently trades with the NCR, so you'll likely find her at the Mojave Outpost.
AID00135692	Actually, let me ask you something else first.
AID00135693	Alright.
AID00135694	Can I ask you something else?
AID00135695	Sure.
AID00135696	It was fun. He made a noise like a deflating balloon.
AID00135697	You're psychotic! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
AID00135698	I didn't know he worked for you.
AID00135699	Oh, because that makes it so much better! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
AID00135700	The Legion caught him and crucified him. I was just trying to end his pain.
AID00135701	<Lie> The Legion caught him and crucified him. He was dead when I found him.
AID00135702	Dammit! Okay, well, thank you for finding out at least. Was there something else you needed?
AID00135703	<Truth> I killed him.
AID00135704	What? Why the hell would you do that? Are you insane?
AID00135705	I'm afraid he's dead.
AID00135706	What? How? What happened?
AID00135707	Not yet, but I had more questions.
AID00135708	Okay, but please find him as soon as you can.
AID00135709	Just the matter of my extra pay.
AID00135710	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
AID00135711	That might have been a tad... excessive.
AID00135712	Maybe, maybe not. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
AID00135713	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
AID00135714	You just shot that man, solely because he insulted you!
AID00135715	Yep. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
AID00135716	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
AID00135717	CaptainParkerArrest
AID00135718	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling and the sale of unlicensed chems.
AID00135719	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for the sale of unlicensed chems.
AID00135720	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling.
AID00135721	Come quietly now, I don't want to have to hurt you.
AID00135722	You son of a bitch!
AID00135723	I found this syringe on Private Stone.
AID00135724	This is definitely part of my missing supplies. I'll talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
AID00135725	It's better if you turn yourself in rather than me turning you in.
AID00135726	[SUCCEEDED] I... I guess you're right. I'll do the right thing and turn myself in.

AID00135734	The only thing down there is a swim of several hundred feet against the current. You'd drown for sure.
AID00135735	Who's in charge of the Gun Runners?
AID00135736	Out here, we don't have bosses. Me, the gunsmiths, and the guards all know what we're supposed to be doing.
AID00135737	Working for the Gun Runners is a sweet job. None of us would dare screw it up.
AID00135738	Do you have enough scrap metal yet?
AID00135739	No, not yet.
AID00135740	It looks like that last bit you brought me was enough to fill the quota.
AID00135741	Here are the caps I promised you.  Make sure to let Contreras know the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
AID00135742	Never mind.
AID00135743	Well, keep at it.
AID00135744	Pots.
AID00135745	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135746	Metal cooking pots.
AID00135747	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135748	Hot plates.
AID00135749	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135750	Coffee pots.
AID00135751	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135752	Metal cooking pans.
AID00135753	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135754	Pressure cookers.
AID00135755	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135756	Irons.
AID00135757	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135758	Scrap metal.
AID00135759	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135760	Tin cans.
AID00135761	Thanks, that'll help.
AID00135762	I've got some scrap for you.
AID00135763	Alright, whatcha got?
AID00135764	Any chance I could get a tour of the Gun Runner factory?
AID00135765	None whatsoever. Everything inside the fence is off-limits, and the guards have strict orders to shoot to kill.
AID00135766	A lot of our high-end weaponry comes from Pre-War military schematics. If our competition got a hold of them, it'd be bad for business.
AID00135767	Maybe I could help you out with those supplies.
AID00135768	Well, I guess so.  Look.  We just need metal, and lots of it.
AID00135769	We can handle the weapons, we just need extra scrap to melt down for the bullets.
AID00135770	I'll give you some caps for each piece of metal you can bring me.  Anything like scrap, cans, or any basic junk made of metal will do.
AID00135771	I'll need at least 100 pieces to have enough for the bullets.  I'll cash in whatever you've got until we have enough.  Good luck.
AID00135772	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135773	No problem.
AID00135774	< Speech 80 >
AID00135775	[SUCCEEDED] You're right.  I suppose we could refurbish used and damaged weapons to fill the order.
AID00135776	They'll be in like new condition and then we can use our loader to make fresh ammo from spent brass.
AID00135777	We'll have to wait a few days for gunpowder, but this might just work out.  Tell Contreras the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
AID00135778	Gun Runners are skilled enough to refurbish weapons like new, right? You're overthinking this.
AID00135779	[FAILED] Sorry, but blackening our reputation with our biggest client isn't worth the risk.
AID00135780	Just give McCarran some used weapons. I mean, as long as they work, right?
AID00135781	< Barter 80 >
AID00135782	[SUCCEEDED] I guess we'll have to.  If Caesar's Legion drives the NCR from the area, there goes ninety percent of our business.
AID00135783	I don't like the idea of buying supplies from our competition, but it's only temporary. We'll call in extra supplies from our distributors.
AID00135784	Let Contreras know we'll have the extra guns and ammo ready for the next shipment.
AID00135785	Arrange a temporary supply deal with other merchants. It'll still lead to a profit for you.
AID00135786	[FAILED] Oh hell, no.  Working with our competition is not an option.
AID00135787	Just buy the supplies from the other merchants around here. Easy enough.
AID00135788	Contreras sent me. McCarran needs a lot more guns and ammo.
AID00135789	Shit. Is he serious? The 25% increase in weapons is doable, but a 50% increase in ammunition is nuts.
AID00135790	We just don't have the supplies on hand to meet that kind of demand for new weapons.
AID00135791	Who are the Gun Runners?
AID00135792	Makers of the finest high-grade weapons and ammunition in the wasteland.
AID00135793	If you ever get your hands on a piece of sweet, deadly hardware, there's a good chance that it came from one of our factories.
AID00135794	So you work for the Gun Runners?
AID00135795	For around five years now. I handle the supply ends of things - raw materials and stuff.
AID00135796	Goodbye.
AID00135797	Later.

AID00135903	We've got some news for you, coming right up.
AID00135904	All the latest news, coming your way right now.

AID00135910	It's just about time to get you some news.
AID00135911	Here are our top stories.
AID00135912	Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora, here.
AID00135913	I've got news for you.

AID00135925	You got it.
AID00135926	What needs to be done?
AID00135927	If you had a few dozen doses of Psycho on you, maybe we could pep these weepy troopers into charging down into Nelson and taking back the camp.
AID00135928	But since that's not likely, you could help me take out the Legion's trooper hostages.
AID00135929	I think it's time to knock you down a peg or two, ranger.
AID00135930	We'll see about that.
AID00135931	You've got five seconds to get out of my sight before I shove that rifle where the sun don't shine.
AID00135932	Son of a bitch!
AID00135933	Understood.
AID00135934	Much obliged.
AID00135935	Sounds rough. I'll be heading out now...
AID00135936	The name's &PCName;.
AID00135937	Oh, heck, I've heard of you. Supposed to be a regular hero or something, ain't that right?
AID00135938	But maybe you're a little too... "reputable" to get involved in some dirty work for the Republic.
AID00135939	I've heard of you. You're just the kind of person I'm looking for. Not afraid of stepping on a few toes to get a job done. Think you can lend a hand?
AID00135940	Is that so? Can't say I've ever heard a good word about you. Lot of bad ones, though.
AID00135941	So why don't you just turn your butt around and scoot back down the road before I blast some daylight through you?
AID00135942	My apologies, but that name and face ain't ringing the old school bell upstairs. Afraid I can't let you through until the "situation" is resolved.
AID00135943	Where are you from?
AID00135944	A little place in the NCR called Oak Creek. Used to be a farming town until it got taken over by ranchers.
AID00135945	I didn't want to herd Brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the Crimson Caravan and headed east. Not much to tell, really.
AID00135946	Do your caravans ever have trouble from bandits?
AID00135947	Out here, we usually split our caravans into smaller bands - that way, we don't lose everything if they get hit.
AID00135948	It's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
AID00135949	Where does the Crimson Caravan Company get its merchandise?
AID00135950	Trade routes, my friend, trade routes. Just about every major town in the wasteland has a Crimson Caravan branch in it.
AID00135951	That's all. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135952	Can you answer some questions for me?
AID00135953	Maybe. What do you want to know?
AID00135954	< Barter 50 >
AID00135955	[SUCCEEDED] That should work. We'll do a weighted exchanged based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
AID00135956	Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
AID00135957	McCarran is overstocked with water and fresh vegetables. Arrange for a two for one trade.
AID00135958	[FAILED] We don't need vegetables, and besides, they spoil. The meat you can dry and turn into jerky.
AID00135959	What's the problem? They have vegetables - trade them for that.
AID00135960	< Speech 70 >
AID00135961	[SUCCEEDED] Well, the Far Go Traders have been trying to edge us out on the new armor contract for the troops. This could swing things in our favor.
AID00135962	All right, let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
AID00135963	Give them a deal on the price, you'll have the upper hand in future, more important negotiations.
AID00135964	[FAILED] This is business. I really can't cut them a deal on the cost.
AID00135965	It's the NCR military. You can give them a deal, right?
AID00135966	McCarran has plenty of caps to cover the shipment. They'll deal with the cost.
AID00135967	Excellent.  We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
AID00135968	McCarran needs a regular shipment of brahmin meat and spices for the mess hall.
AID00135969	Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local Brahmin ranchers.
AID00135970	The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat with cost some serious caps.
AID00135971	Never mind.
AID00135972	No reason. Just curious.
AID00135973	Some of those could be combined with other chemicals to make drugs...
AID00135974	Really?  Huh, never thought of that.  The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
AID00135975	Combining those with chemical cleaners would yield strong chems...
AID00135976	Really?  Huh, never thought of that.  The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
AID00135977	Is there something special about these supplies?
AID00135978	Well, pain-killers are easy to come by, but it isn't easy finding iodine, allergy meds, and a few of these other items. Why do you ask?
AID00135979	Will do.
AID00135980	Need anything else?
AID00135981	Contreras sent me for some medical supplies.
AID00135982	Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
AID00135983	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00135984	Can do.
AID00135985	Goodbye.
AID00135986	See ya.
AID00135987	It seems like that the companies are getting the better deal.
AID00135988	That's because we are. We always pay up when the contract ends, though. Won't stay in business long if you've got a reputation as a cheat.
AID00135989	Are work contracts legal?
AID00135990	Yes, and they have been for decades now. The hired hands know what they're signing up for - we don't hide anything with fancy talk.
AID00135991	What kind of upkeep expenses?
AID00135992	Food, water, living quarters, medicine, and clothes - just the basic stuff. It all comes out of the Company's coffers.
AID00135993	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
AID00135994	Are work contracts common for the Crimson Caravan Company?
AID00135995	Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
AID00135996	The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep expenses are deducted, of course.
AID00135997	You have a deal.
AID00135998	I'm glad to hear it.
AID00135999	I need to consider your offer.
AID00136000	Take all the time you need.
AID00136001	< Barter 65 >
AID00136002	[SUCCEEDED] Intriguing. Janet puts in a good word for me, and the Crimson Caravan gains exclusive access to the Boomers. Yes, that works for me.
AID00136003	Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
AID00136004	Opening up trade with the Boomers would be easier with Janet in their camp, wouldn't you agree?
AID00136005	[FAILED] The Crimson Caravan Company's operations require dependable employees. I'm not going to reward someone for breaking their work contract.
AID00136006	Janet's wages can't be that much. Why bother keeping them from her?
AID00136007	< Speech 75 >
AID00136008	[SUCCEEDED] Being sentimental is not how I made the Crimson Caravan so successful, but I'll allow it, just this once.
AID00136009	Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
AID00136010	Are you really going to ruin what's supposed to be a time of happiness for her?
AID00136011	[FAILED] You'll have to try harder than that. The rumors about my heart being made of stone are true.
AID00136012	Oh, come on. She's in love. Give her a break.
AID00136013	Janet's asked me to talk to you about releasing her from her contract.
AID00136014	Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
AID00136015	She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
AID00136016	Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
AID00136017	My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.

AID00136024	One more story for you...
AID00136025	RNVNewsStoryLine3
AID00136026	He added he didn't want to see the NCR in the ghetto, and called for a mass, quote, return to sender.
AID00136027	Said he'd always wanted to sleep with the Lakelurks.
AID00136028	Don't you laugh at me. I know a spell that'll make you show your true form. Cave rat taught it to me.
AID00136029	Listeners are not advised to follow that path in hopes of similar results.
AID00136030	Esteban's going home now. I can't tell you what that means to me.
AID00136031	Nor is he allowed to sample the world-class cuisine of the Gourmand, New Vegas' only 5-star restaurant.
AID00136032	The legate then ordered a tenth of his own force be killed by the other nine tenths. And you thought your boss was a pain.
AID00136033	Once again, NCR President Aaron Kimball, dead at 48.
AID00136034	RNVNewsStoryLine2
AID00136035	Now that's a delivery service you can count on.
AID00136036	Loading Public Appeasement Oration... complete. Howdy... citizens. How about a yee-haw for law and order in the fine town of ERROR: TOKEN NOT FOUND?
AID00136037	Howdy do, folks. I'm Sheriff Meyers. Be good, or I'll shoot you dead.
AID00136038	People of Primm, the NCR wishes to inform you that you are under their jurisdiction now. And from now on, you're gonna be living by our rules.
AID00136039	If I know my pal Benny, he's swinging with the Big Cat Upstairs as we speak. Or he's chasing some angel broad with cans as big as her halo! <Laughs>
AID00136040	Do I seem worried to you, baby? Sometimes a cat just needs room to swing. He'll be back, sure as a conga drum's got a groovy beat.
AID00136041	Once again, Caesar, dead. A shocking turn of events whose impact is anyone's guess at this point.
AID00136042	Caesar said he expected to resume his campaign of terror and mayhem as soon as he receives medical clearance.
AID00136043	<Sighs> Dang it. I could've used one of those.
AID00136044	Caesar's Legion is believed to have been behind the attack.
AID00136045	When asked why, the source said someone alerted them to the fact that Caesar's Legion was comprised of, quote, a bunch of squares.
AID00136046	Travelers are advised not to make friendly chit-chat with them.
AID00136047	Freesiders are hoping they'll drop food. I wouldn't get your hopes up, Freesiders.
AID00136048	In possibly related news, local chem dealers report an overall decrease in their standard of living.
AID00136049	The leader of the Kings, who would only identify himself as "The King" voiced his displeasure, calling NCR citizens, quote, the devil in disguise.
AID00136050	I feel so bad. I think it's time we reconsider, baby.
AID00136051	No suspects have been identified, but seniors are advised to be on the lookout for the  so-called Denture Killer.
AID00136052	Before he left, Nero told me him and Big Sal were real tired, see? Said they were gonna go camping up at Lake Mead.
AID00136053	Asked to comment, Big Sal said, quote, the fuck you looking at? You wearing a wire? Are you? I'll break your fucking kneecaps. Hey. Get back here.
AID00136054	One witness said, quote, God sent us two angels. And at least one had him a .308 caliber flaming sword of justice with a telescopic sight.
AID00136055	It's ghouls, I tell ya. Religious ghouls in rockets looking for a land to call their own.
AID00136056	Possible causes suggested were engineering mistakes, centuries-old equipment, and the fact that the rockets were piloted by a cult of crazy ghouls.
AID00136057	Witness descriptions are remarkably similar to accounts of the Goodsprings courier who, as we reported, recently survived a gunshot to the head.
AID00136058	It was such an incredible thing he did, putting his life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do.
AID00136059	It was such an incredible thing she did, putting her life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do.
AID00136060	Mr. Gunderson is no longer a welcome guest at the Ultra-Luxe.
AID00136061	The attacks are all the more troubling since there has not been a zoo in the area in quite some time.
AID00136062	The chief scientist at the plant vowed to fix the problem, blaming it on an atmosphere of, quote, severe underappreciation.
AID00136063	Those who can afford passports are saying the added security is well worth the price of admission.
AID00136064	One anonymous official told us a serious mechanical failure would be a disaster because of the age of the train and scarcity of replacement parts.
AID00136065	NCR sources say that holding the Dam against Caesar's Legion has become their main strategic priority, and this move would not be unexpected.
AID00136066	One refugee told us the legate took over an underperforming squad of troops by beating its commander to death in full view of everyone.
AID00136067	If you should find it, do not - repeat, do not - belittle a Super Mutant for taking the bunny slope.
AID00136068	Those who claim to have dined at the restaurant find the food appealing but say many tables remain empty.
AID00136069	The secret ingredient? Tender loving care, according to the chef.
AID00136070	The president's Vertibird exploded in midair as he departed following the address. Investigators say the explosion was not an accident.
AID00136071	The president's Vertibird crashed into the side of the Dam as he departed following the address. Authorities suspect sabotage.
AID00136072	The president's Vertibird was destroyed by one of the Dam's howitzer cannons. Investigators say the gun had been tampered with.
AID00136073	An assassin attacked the president in full view of the crowd, but was not apprehended. Witness descriptions of the killer differ wildly.
AID00136074	An NCR private scheduled to receive an award exploded as he reached the stage, killing the president in the blast.

AID00136076	Can I ask you something else?

AID00136113	Where would you suggest I find meat in the amount you'd need here?
AID00136114	It doesn't need to all come from the same source. There are a bunch of different vendors around who sell meat. Fitz, the Nash's, Crimson Caravan...
AID00136115	We've never really tried to go out and organize deals with merchants to supply our food. Already having an overstock of food, we haven't needed to.
AID00136116	But we really need some good-old red meat on the menu soon, so I'm willing to divert some caps in their direction if they're open to supplying us.
AID00136117	I'd like to talk about something else.
AID00136118	What can I do for you?
AID00136119	Goodbye.
AID00136120	Have a good one.

AID00136123	Sir, yes, Sir!
AID00136124	Can the launch wait a few minutes?
AID00136125	Very few. Time is wasting. Hurry back so we can begin.
AID00136126	Nevermind, I'll go looking for your components.
AID00136127	Hurry back. Never have we been so close.
AID00136128	Where can I find Jason?
AID00136129	The great one can be found upstairs. Don't think about wasting his time. He's very important. You should feel lucky to be granted some of his time.
AID00136130	You're an idiot if you believe everything you hear. You want my help or what?
AID00136131	Well, now that you've sweet-talked me...
AID00136132	[FAILED] Naw, why don't you just get out of here?
AID00136133	Like I care what anyone says about me. Do you want help dealing with the Legion or not?
AID00136134	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I don't care much, either. At least not enough to turn down an offer for help.
AID00136135	I can... do bad things.
AID00136136	[FAILED] Right. You have trouble even saying the word "bad". Go on, get out of here if you know what's good for you.
AID00136137	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
AID00136138	Are you interested in cracking jokes or getting something done?
AID00136139	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I'll be damned. Looks like you've got some dirt in you after all.
AID00136140	I won't do anything dishonorable, if that's what you mean.
AID00136141	"Dishonorable", that's a good one. Okay then, you can just turn around and head back toward Novac or wherever it is you came from.
AID00136142	I wouldn't want you to get any dirt under your fingernails or tarnish your good name or whatever the heck you're so worried about.
AID00136143	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
AID00136144	Why don't you try to rescue them?
AID00136145	Back at "Ranger School", they taught us not to run headlong into a battle when you're outnumbered ten to one.
AID00136146	You want to go down there and try to haul those crippled boys off those poles, you're dumber than you look.
AID00136147	Goodbye.
AID00136148	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136149	Sign me up.
AID00136150	Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
AID00136151	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
AID00136152	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
AID00136153	[Psycho] Funny you should mention Psycho. I actually have a few dozen doses on me...
AID00136154	All right, I have to admit I wasn't expecting you to say that. I was just joking. But if it makes you feel any better, I am impressed.
AID00136155	So anyway, how about those hostages?
AID00136156	Why take out the hostages?
AID00136157	The troopers won't go down into the camp with their comrades at risk. Dirty game the Legion likes to roll out whenever they get a chance.
AID00136158	Problem is, Ranger Milo doesn't want to play. If we take out the hostages, they've got squat for leverage.
AID00136159	Don't you have the authority to command the troopers to go into the camp?
AID00136160	I'm a ranger. They're troopers. Different branches. I don't have authority over them even though they're as green as a Super Mutant's backside.
AID00136161	Besides, they'd probably start crying as soon as they saw the hostages get so much as a bruise. Nope, they don't got the stomach for it.
AID00136162	I don't need any compensation.
AID00136163	Ahh, doing this out of the goodness of your heart. You don't see that very often around here. Thank you.
AID00136164	Thanks.
AID00136165	My pleasure. Thanks again.
AID00136166	That's not necessary.
AID00136167	That's very gracious of you. Again, you have my thanks.
AID00136168	Thanks, I appreciate it.
AID00136169	You're welcome. Enjoy.
AID00136170	RNVDamOuttro
AID00136171	Sources at the Dam are telling us that the involvement of one key person appears to have heavily influenced the outcome.
AID00136172	RNVDamStory
AID00136173	Reports indicate that NCR forces emerged victorious, and the Legion scattered amidst the defeat of its most feared military leader.
AID00136174	Preliminary word is that Caesar's Legion has taken control of the Dam, and that the NCR presence in Nevada is severely crippled.
AID00136175	While it initially appeared to be an NCR victory, we're receiving word that our own Mr. House may have been the one to secure the Dam for himself.
AID00136176	But in a shocking turn of events, the Dam has been rendered useless, and both sides have taken heavy casualties. Neither faction appears to have won.
AID00136177	But in a shocking turn of events, an army of Securitrons has seized control of the Dam, preventing both sides from claiming it.
AID00136178	Two choices. You point me to any odd guns you've seen lately, or I paint the curb with your brains.
AID00136179	Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
AID00136180	These ten caps are yours if you point me to anyone you've seen with a weird old gun.
AID00136181	Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
AID00136182	Blaaagghhh.
AID00136183	I would bribe you but I don't have much on me. Would you accept an IOU?
AID00136184	I'm looking for someone carrying an antique gun.
AID00136185	Heh heh heh heh ooo, heh heh heh.
AID00136186	Indeed I have, my articulate friend. Not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
AID00136187	If you cover the area methodically, I'm quite certain you'll happen upon them with only the most insubstantial of delays.
AID00136188	Be well. And do try and avoid the tragic path of the sot that led me to my present infirmities and spiritual woes.
AID00136189	There's a corpse nearby. Anybody been near it?
AID00136190	I haven't been anywhere but here for... well, who the hell knows? If there's a corpse I haven't been babysitting it.
AID00136191	But I'll tell you who needs some babysitting. Those damn kids keep running around in here.
AID00136192	They got parents? I don't know. Wish they did so they'd leave me be.
AID00136193	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
AID00136194	Very Well. You may proceed. However, be warned. Aggressive acts will earn you a place on a cross.
AID00136195	I don't have the caps.
AID00136196	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AID00136197	Here's the caps.
AID00136198	All right. Sit still and let me work.
AID00136199	Can you cure my addiction?
AID00136200	You really ought to avoid using those kinds of chems, but I'll see what I can do.
AID00136201	Could you remind me where I should look for supplies?
AID00136202	What do you need to know?
AID00136203	Goodbye.
AID00136204	Goodbye.
AID00136205	<Pay caps>
AID00136206	Okay. This will just take a moment.
AID00136207	<Pay 50 caps>
AID00136208	Okay. This will just take a moment.
AID00136209	<Pay 45 caps>
AID00136210	Okay. This will just take a moment.
AID00136211	<Pay 40 caps>
AID00136212	I'm still working on it.
AID00136213	Hidden Valley is the place to keep working, then.
AID00136214	I worked out a deal where the Brotherhood will help the NCR defend the dam.
AID00136215	And why would you have done that?
AID00136216	Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving then a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
AID00136217	Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
AID00136218	Goodbye.
AID00136219	Come back when you have something to report.
AID00136220	I'll do as you ask.
AID00136221	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
AID00136222	What's in it for me to go back to the Fort?
AID00136223	I'll go back and do as you ask.
AID00136224	What about Benny?
AID00136225	What about Benny?
AID00136226	What about Benny?
AID00136227	What about Benny?
AID00136228	What about him? He has every reason to go to the Fort, so that's where you'll find him.
AID00136229	All I ask is that you recover the Chip. What happens to Benny is up to you.
AID00136230	What do I do next?
AID00136231	I won't lie to you. It'll be dangerous.
AID00136232	Not interested. Good luck getting the Chip back.
AID00136233	As I've told you before, you are contractually obligated to deliver the Chip. Do your job - you have everything to gain.
AID00136234	Were you aware that he hijacked a Securitron and used it to infiltrate your network?
AID00136235	I suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
AID00136236	That would be how he learned of the Platinum Chip in the first place... not to mention where to intercept you, on your way in.
AID00136237	Highly resourceful, Benny. He would've made a fine agent, had he stayed loyal. It's fortunate you came along to replace him - and ironic.
AID00136238	He set me up for an ambush!
AID00136239	And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb? Really, what did you expect?
AID00136240	Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you? It's becoming a hobby of his.
AID00136241	Where do you think Benny's gone?
AID00136242	His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
AID00136243	It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip  - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
AID00136244	I'd like to ask some questions first...
AID00136245	There will time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
AID00136246	Goodbye.
AID00136247	By "goodbye," I assume you mean to say that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
AID00136248	I'll go get the Platinum Chip.
AID00136249	Excellent idea.
AID00136250	Who are you to tell me what to do?
AID00136251	I'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signed. Now go get the Chip.
AID00136252	What was that you said about security systems?
AID00136253	I'm still working on it.
AID00136254	I'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.
AID00136255	That's enough about the Brotherhood.
AID00136256	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136257	I want to ask you some questions.
AID00136258	I'd like to ask some questions first.
AID00136259	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00136260	I need to ask some questions.
AID00136261	What's next in line?
AID00136262	I'd like to ask some questions first.
AID00136263	What should I expect at the dam?
AID00136264	Imagine two snarling dogs fighting over a curve of bone, perhaps the rib of their master, long-dead.
AID00136265	It'll be a pitched battle, that's a certainty. Perhaps the greatest battle the Earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
AID00136266	With Caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expect. The Legate, Lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
AID00136267	Frontal assaults, wave attacks - these are the sort of tactics one would expect from such a man.
AID00136268	Any speculation on Legion tactics?
AID00136269	The Legion will mount a ferocious and determined frontal assault from the east, that much is certain.
AID00136270	Still, Caesar is a capable strategist. I'd be surprised if he hasn't found some way to infiltrate the dam, or the NCR's rear areas.
AID00136271	Any speculation on Legion tactics?
AID00136272	General Oliver's strategy - or "tunnel vision," as I like to call it - has been to mass troops at Hoover Dam.
AID00136273	He wants to out-fight the Legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
AID00136274	A crushing, decisive victory of this sort would overshadow the tactical ingenuity of Chief Hanlon's defense four years ago, you see.
AID00136275	How will the NCR defend Hoover Dam?
AID00136276	A good deal should be obvious to you by now. I won't spoil the rest by talking out of turn.
AID00136277	What's your battle plan for the Dam?
AID00136278	Why do you care whether Kimball lives or dies?
AID00136279	I care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
AID00136280	Kimball rose to prominence as the "Hero of the Mojave" when he led a campaign of reprisals against tribals who dared to attack NCR citizens.
AID00136281	Ordering the occupation of Hoover Dam was his first act of office. As water and electricity flowed to NCR cities, his popularity soared.
AID00136282	Conversely, his failure to annex the Mojave these seven years, and the immense costs of occupying a foreign land, have eroded his popular support.
AID00136283	Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
AID00136284	If I compell the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
AID00136285	In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
AID00136286	So why don't you want the NCR President to die?
AID00136287	Then the Hero of the Mojave would become the Martyr of Hoover Dam. And when, subsequently, I force the NCR to retreat...
AID00136288	They lick their wounds, and dream of righteous vengeance against New Vegas. Hello, embargo, farewell, tourist economy.
AID00136289	I've calculated and re-calculated these probabilities. Kimball must live.
AID00136290	And if Kimball were to be assassinated?
AID00136291	That's enough about the Boomers.
AID00136292	Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00136293	They're a terrorist group, basically. Militant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding Pre-War technology.
AID00136294	Not all technology, mind you. You don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away Auto-Docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
AID00136295	No, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that puts people in hospitals. Or graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the Dodo.
AID00136296	Because they're ridiculous! Because they galavant around the Mojave pretending to be Knights of Yore.
AID00136297	Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.
AID00136298	The world has no use for emotionally unstable techno-fetishists. Just wipe them out, will you?
AID00136299	Why do you hate the Brotherhood so much?
AID00136300	You recruited the Omertas as one of the Three Families?
AID00136301	Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
AID00136302	They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
AID00136303	They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
AID00136304	They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
AID00136305	The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
AID00136306	As for the White Glove Society, I afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
AID00136307	What were the original names of the other tribes?
AID00136308	Tell me about the Boomers.
AID00136309	They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
AID00136310	Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
AID00136311	Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
AID00136312	Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
AID00136313	You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
AID00136314	The Boomers sound dangerous.
AID00136315	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00136316	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136317	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136318	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136319	<Goodbye.>
AID00136320	<Secondary factions.>
AID00136321	<Major factions.>
AID00136322	<Vegas history.>
AID00136323	<House about himself.>
AID00136324	<Benny's fate.>
AID00136325	<Change subject.>
AID00136326	<Go on.>
AID00136327	You haven't asked what became of Benny.
AID00136328	What if I give you twenty caps? That's... uh... way more than a million!
AID00136329	Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
AID00136330	I don't think I can come up with that kind of cash.
AID00136331	Well, if you can get me most of it, I could give you a loan for the rest.
AID00136332	It's invisible.
AID00136333	Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
AID00136334	I don't have it here. I'll have to go get it.
AID00136335	I'll be shooting Stacey till you get back. Just saying goodbye to it, you know?
AID00136336	Yeah, but your heavy use has really depreciated its value. It's only worth twenty caps now.
AID00136337	Aw, man. It's Stacey's fault. She pretends like she didn't get hit.
AID00136338	That's still a lot of money. I guess I'll take it.
AID00136339	It's worth 1000 caps to me.
AID00136340	You mean it? Wow, thanks!
AID00136341	I bet me and Stacey can get something real cool at Mick and Ralph's with that.
AID00136342	Yeah? Let's see it.
AID00136343	Can I buy that gun from you?
AID00136344	This is the best gun in the whole galaxy. I paid a million caps for it. And it wasn't even brand new.
AID00136345	You look tired. Maybe you should take a break.
AID00136346	I don't really like to go to bed until it gets dark out.
AID00136347	Yeah, it's time for me to sleep now.
AID00136348	Goodnight.
AID00136349	I'm a space soldier. The general sent me to ask you to borrow your gun to stop an alien invasion.
AID00136350	Really? Cool! Bring it back to me when you're done, okay? I think Stacey might be turning into an alien.
AID00136351	Give me that gun.
AID00136352	Sorry, but I need it to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
AID00136353	Goodbye.
AID00136354	Goodbye.
AID00136355	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
AID00136356	500 caps sounds right.
AID00136357	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
AID00136358	I don't need it. Keep it.
AID00136359	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
AID00136360	For a job well done... 200 caps.
AID00136361	We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. Sorry, stranger, it'll have to do.
AID00136362	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
AID00136363	Actually, just keep it.
AID00136364	We do need it, stranger. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
AID00136365	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
AID00136366	Goodbye.
AID00136367	That's right, get out of here! If I see you ever again, I'll pump you full of lead, you hear?
AID00136368	You're alive thanks to me. I expect my reward.
AID00136369	... I... I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
AID00136370	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
AID00136371	Sooner or later she'd have left anyway.
AID00136372	Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, accept half of our reserve. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
AID00136373	Goodbye.
AID00136374	Goodbye, stranger.
AID00136375	You're going to leave, just like that? All right, stranger... Thank you for everything.
AID00136376	<Attack> I'll take the money from Crimson Caravan as well.
AID00136377	I shouldn't have trusted you.
AID00136378	You think you can take it? All right, bastard! I'll give you what you deserve!
AID00136379	After all I've done, 200 caps won't do.
AID00136380	[SUCCEEDED] Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, take this: it's half of our savings. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
AID00136381	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
AID00136382	Having your daughter back should be worth more than 200 caps.
AID00136383	[FAILED] We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. This is all we can give.
AID00136384	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
AID00136385	I don't need it. Keep your money.
AID00136386	We do need it. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
AID00136387	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
AID00136388	What is it that you really want?
AID00136389	There's only one solution: I'm going to take him out.
AID00136390	No charge, just helping out.
AID00136391	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip cat.
AID00136392	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip kitten.
AID00136393	How about a little pick-me-up?
AID00136394	Here you go, this'll give you some zing.
AID00136395	Some caps would be nice.
AID00136396	Here's a little tink-tink to weight your pockets.
AID00136397	Because no one else is going to help you.
AID00136398	[FAILED] Nice speech. Take a hike.
AID00136399	I'd really like to help. And what's the worst that could happen, Nelson stays captured?
AID00136400	[SUCCEEDED] Good point. Anyway, it's your hide. Guess I should take all the help I can get.
AID00136401	You sure you don't want my help with the Legion?
AID00136402	I sent you packing last time for a reason. Why should I let you in now?
AID00136403	I changed my mind about helping you with your Legion problem. I'm in.
AID00136404	Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
AID00136405	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
AID00136406	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
AID00136407	Is there anything I can do to help around here?
AID00136408	Are you in charge here?
AID00136409	Nope. I'm just the only ranger around. The rest of the kids here are troopers, inexperienced, out-numbered and under-equipped.
AID00136410	Are there any towns nearby?
AID00136411	There's Novac, due west. Just look for the big lizard. They got some decent supplies and a place to stay.
AID00136412	The 188's north on the 95, good for all kinds of trade. Not much south on 95 unless you turn west on 164 to Nipton, right off the rail line.
AID00136413	What happened here?
AID00136414	Troopers tried moving down from Forlorn Hope because we got this big gap between there and Searchlight. Turns out we were spread too thin.
AID00136415	We took our sweet ass time setting up in Nelson and the Legion managed to hop over the Colorado and attack before things were settled.
AID00136416	I don't think I can help you. Sorry.
AID00136417	That's a shame. Well, let me know if you change your mind or those Legion sons of bitches will be holed up in Nelson for weeks.
AID00136418	Okay. I'm in.
AID00136419	Fine. Let's go.
AID00136420	Come on. Let me help out. Trust me.
AID00136421	[FAILED] That's one of the least trustworthy lines I've ever heard. Sorry. No can do.
AID00136422	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
AID00136423	You may not know me, but I'm no friend of the Legion, and I'll lend a hand to get rid of them.
AID00136424	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. It's not like any of the troopers around here are jumping up to volunteer.
AID00136425	I should be going now...
AID00136426	VDialogueVeronicaEuclidReaction
AID00136427	Wow. Good thing the safety was on.
AID00136428	The rangefinder might be a problem. I reactivated HELIOS One, and it's not powering a weapon.
AID00136429	Ah, hell. Well, how could you know, right? Okay. Two other options still on the table.
AID00136430	You might want to ask Contreras at Camp McCarran that question.
AID00136431	Contreras?! What's his involvement? Was he selling drugs to Price?
AID00136432	<Draw weapon> Well, you're never going to find out.
AID00136433	He gave me a package to deliver and now he asked me to kill you.
AID00136434	Sounds like the evidence we need to bring him in for questioning and search his shack, but why are you telling me all of this?
AID00136435	If Contreras is a scumbag, I want him caught.
AID00136436	Well, thanks for the tip, but we'll need more evidence. Talk to Boyd at McCarran.
AID00136437	I've been working with her in this investigation.
AID00136438	Goodbye.
AID00136439	What will happen to him if he's guilty?
AID00136440	What makes a bottle cap genuine?
AID00136441	Lots of little things - the paint on the label, the machining, the type of metal it's made from.
AID00136442	I know there's counterfeit caps floating around, of course. Fortunately, they're very time-consuming to make, so the numbers are small.
AID00136443	Are new bottle caps ever made?
AID00136444	Certainly. Bottle caps do wear out or get damaged. Some people even insist on using bottle caps in explosive devices for some reason.
AID00136445	We make it a point to scour Pre-War bottling plants and recover or disable the bottle cap presses. It seems we missed one.
AID00136446	Why is a bottle cap press a problem for you?
AID00136447	People have been counterfeiting bottle caps forever, but it's always been small scale.
AID00136448	A bottle cap press is a whole other threat. We can't have anyone devaluing our currency by mass producing new bottle caps.
AID00136449	Let's talk about something else now.
AID00136450	The bottle cap press is no longer a problem.
AID00136451	Good. I'm sure you were thorough. Here's your payment for a job well done.
AID00136452	I had some questions about bottle cap currency.
AID00136453	What would you like to know?
AID00136454	Is there anything else you need me to do?
AID00136455	Something has actually come up. A prospector recently came through here and spent a lot of caps on supplies.
AID00136456	Closer inspection of these caps has revealed them to be brand new. This is a problem.
AID00136457	The most likely source of these new caps is the old sarsaparilla bottling plant. Go there, locate the bottle cap press, and disable it.
AID00136458	Goodbye.
AID00136459	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136460	Whatever.
AID00136461	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
AID00136462	Maybe I can help?
AID00136463	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136464	Whatever.
AID00136465	Goodbye.
AID00136466	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
AID00136467	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
AID00136468	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136469	Whatever.
AID00136470	I'll think about it.
AID00136471	Don't think too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
AID00136472	Goodbye.
AID00136473	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136474	Whatever.
AID00136475	Goodbye.
AID00136476	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136477	Whatever.
AID00136478	Goodbye.
AID00136479	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136480	Whatever.
AID00136481	Can I ask you something else?
AID00136482	Whatever.
AID00136483	You don't have a say. Go back in your cave.
AID00136484	A paladin always has a say where the Codex is concerned. Veronica's aspirations are seditious.
AID00136485	All of us here are sworn to obey and protect the Codex, even against one of our own. She's gone too far this time.
AID00136486	No... this has to end now.
AID00136487	Execute them.
AID00136488	Won't stand for what? She plans to respect the Elder's decision.
AID00136489	Respect, nothing. She plans to whisper in his ear. Poison him against the Codex.
AID00136490	It won't be a problem. She's leaving.
AID00136491	Leaving? Into exile? Good. Save us the trouble.
AID00136492	But mark me well. Any hint of treachery or thought of return and we will erase the both of you from existence.
AID00136493	All right, here you go.
AID00136494	All right, you're clean. Come back by here when you're done at the tables.
AID00136495	[Sneak] Sure, take whatever you can find. <Holdout>
AID00136496	[FAILED] Nice try, wiseass. Now hand everything over before you make a *second* mistake.
AID00136497	[FAILED] Oh, now, what surprise - someone trying to smuggle in weapons.
AID00136498	Look, jackass, the job's rough enough as it is without troublemakers like you, so either hand it all over or take your caps elsewhere.
AID00136499	Forget it, I don't need to gamble that bad.
AID00136500	I'm going in - touch my weapons, I'll kill you.
AID00136501	You just made a big mistake.
AID00136502	Easy to hide weapons?
AID00136503	Things guards can't spot when they're patting you down or checking for iron at your hip.
AID00136504	Why would I need to hide a weapon on me?
AID00136505	Simple - you can't bring guns into the casino, that's why. They'll strip you to your fists.
AID00136506	Surrre, they say you get it all back when you leave. Me? I don't like being without a little *insurance* when it's my caps on the table.
AID00136507	Let's see what you have.
AID00136508	Take a look at these beauties.
AID00136509	The right weapons for my kind of customer.
AID00136510	The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count of me, friend.
AID00136511	You aren't exactly good for business, so you'll have to live with my prices.
AID00136512	Have a discount, friend. I can't wait to see what you do with these, next.
AID00136513	It's an honor to have my wares used by such a wild badass. Cut's on the house, friend.
AID00136514	Not interested. Maybe some other time.
AID00136515	Suit yourself, it's not my fault if they find your body dumped in Freeside.
AID00136516	Stay safe.
AID00136517	Goodbye.
AID00136518	You know where to find me, friend.
AID00136519	Goodbye.
AID00136520	Make yourself scarce, I got to keep my image.
AID00136521	Goodbye.
AID00136522	Bring on the mayhem, friend.
AID00136523	Goodbye.
AID00136524	I can get weapons past the guards, no problem.
AID00136525	[SUCCEEDED] You might - one fellow I knew was able to slip a pistol past the guards. You? I'm guessing you could get a machine gun by them.
AID00136526	Hmmm... think I could I slip bigger weapons past the guards?
AID00136527	[FAILED] An experienced smuggler could get a machine gun or pistol in - you? You're welcome to try.
AID00136528	I'll do as you ask.
AID00136529	Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
AID00136530	Let's see who's pathetic.
AID00136531	True to Caesar.
AID00136532	Who are you?
AID00136533	I am Dead Sea, Decanus of the Legion by the grace of Caesar, not that you're in any position to ask questions.
AID00136534	What are you going to do about it?
AID00136535	I'll execute Caesar's will by hurling your corpse into the Colorado - like the other Profligates before you!
AID00136536	Who are you?
AID00136537	I am a loyal servant of Caesar, and I thank my good fortune for the day that he plucked me as a babe from the shore of the Great Salt Lake.
AID00136538	For five years I have had the privilege of serving as a Decanus. If fortune continues to smile upon me, I will serve him until I draw my last breath.
AID00136539	I hope that satisfies your curiosity about me, because I won't waste any more of Caesar's time talking about myself.
AID00136540	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136541	You've got my ear.
AID00136542	Well to each their own I guess.
AID00136543	Flipping switches is fun.
AID00136544	What is wrong with the other turbines?
AID00136545	A little bit ago one of the intake towers got clogged. No water running through it anymore to spin the generators.
AID00136546	One of these days I'll get some boys out to the turbine to get it running again, but right now it is pretty low on the priority list.
AID00136547	How is the dam running these days?
AID00136548	Been better, been worse. When I first came here there was but one turbine spinning.
AID00136549	At one point shortly after the last battle I had six of them spinning, was a wonderful sound. Only four of them are running right now.
AID00136550	Goodbye.
AID00136551	Good day to you, and stay out of trouble.
AID00136552	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136553	Alright, what's on your mind?
AID00136554	Tell me about the last battle.
AID00136555	I was down here for most of it, so I can't tell you much of what the boys with the guns were doing up top.
AID00136556	From talking to the boys that were fighting up there, I can tell you that Hanlon managed to pull off what most people would have thought impossible.
AID00136557	What do you think of Fantastic?
AID00136558	Well he mostly stays out of the way, which is a good thing. He'd probably end up doing some real damage if he tried to make himself useful.
AID00136559	Right now we mostly let him operate the switchboard for the intercom. Flipping switches seems to keep him pretty happy.
AID00136560	Sad what happened to him. He was a good kid.
AID00136561	What do you do here?
AID00136562	I'm the head engineer. I make sure the turbines keep spinning and the water keeps pumping.
AID00136563	Why do you call this place your baby?
AID00136564	The power station, the dam, they're my babies. Well... don't tell my grandchildren I said that. Anything in here that I haven't rebuilt I've fixed.
AID00136565	I've been here since well before the first battle. I've ground my knuckles on so much cement in here it is nearly as much me as it is cement.
AID00136566	I don't get what the big deal is.
AID00136567	High Elder Maxson didn't just found the Brotherhood. He defined it. To serve in the Brotherhood is to serve his ideals.
AID00136568	Our way of life is based on them. We know no other path. There is no other path.
AID00136569	With her... leanings... Veronica spits in the face of every Knight, Paladin, and Scribe to serve in our ranks.
AID00136570	VDialogueVeronicaCodexReact
AID00136571	Uh... you were kidding just now when you said that thing about the Codex, right?
AID00136572	I will cast down your Codex and bask in the dying agony of those who hold it dear.
AID00136573	No. No!
AID00136574	This isn't your place. You're neither Head Scribe nor Elder.
AID00136575	Their sentimentality prevents them from administering justice.
AID00136576	Our duty is to the Codex above all, something your companion has forgotten. And that gives us the authority to make it our place.
AID00136577	Uh... Veronica just said those things to test you. She didn't mean it.
AID00136578	You're pathetic. Hide behind words all you like, but your cowardice shows through.
AID00136579	Ideals are strengthened by the challenges they endure. Veronica's questioning did you a service.
AID00136580	Hmmph. She'd be doing a greater service by carrying out her duties and not trying to undermine the elder's authority.
AID00136581	This had better be the last time her loyalty falters. You've been warned.
AID00136582	RNVMusicIntroSpecific
AID00136583	Gonna play a song for you right now. It's about that special someone you only find once... in a Blue Moon.
AID00136584	Got some Dean Martin coming up, talking about the greatest feeling in the world, love. "Ain't That A Kick in the Head." Sure is, Dino. It sure is.
AID00136585	Here's Bing Crosby reminding us of those times when you absolutely have to kiss the person you love. "Something's Gotta Give," up next.
AID00136586	Hey New Vegas, have you ever said you loved someone when it wasn't quite true? Sure you have. But you shouldn't. Because It's a Sin to Tell a Lie.
AID00136587	And now Nat King Cole, reminding us what really matters with "Love Me As Though There Were No Tomorrow." Because in New Vegas, hey, you never know.
AID00136588	Got a song for you, now. It's about a guy who's cold on the exterior, but deep down, you know he's a good man. And his name... is Johnny Guitar.
AID00136589	In New Vegas, we know the pain that numbers can bring us. Well, so does Guy Mitchell, who's got "Heartaches by the Number."
AID00136590	Have you ever been in love with a celebrity? You don't have to be shy, I feel it between us, too. Sometimes you can't help being Mad About the Boy.
AID00136591	You know, sometimes the journey beats the destination. Especially if your spurs go Jingle Jangle Jingle, and you meet some nice gals on the way.
AID00136592	JasonBrightFarBeyond
AID00136593	I have glimpsed it only in visions, wanderer, but what I have seen is truly miraculous.
AID00136594	It is a place of light and healing, and I know in my soul that my flock will be safe there.
AID00136595	What is this Far Beyond?
AID00136596	Do you know anything about some NCR supplies?
AID00136597	I saw some Legion assholes carrying crates to a cave north of here. May have been NCR shit, I don't fucking know.
AID00136598	I had another question.
AID00136599	Shoot.
AID00136600	How can I best use your skills?
AID00136601	I like punching things, but sometimes shooting things just has to do.
AID00136602	Who is Father Elijah?
AID00136603	He was our Elder when we came East. A wizard with technology, really. His mind just worked that way naturally. Learned a lot from him.
AID00136604	But he started having disagreements with the other Elders. The Brotherhood's interest is in old technology. He wanted to explore developing new tech.
AID00136605	And there were other ways he wanted to push. Other weapons. Ones with ethics questions attached. Rather than deal with him, they sent him East.
AID00136606	How do you feel about the other members?
AID00136607	I called them family before. That's not far off. Both the good and the bad. It's like a big unending family reunion in that bunker.
AID00136608	There's people you love, people you'll never speak to again, and it's always awkward when you run into someone you used to date.
AID00136609	Does the Brotherhood protect people from raiders or other threats?
AID00136610	No, no. We only protect people from themselves, and only in the sense that we don't let them have the really good Pre-War toys.
AID00136611	And sometimes it's more like we protect ourselves from them and hope to outlive them and become humanity's sole heirs.
AID00136612	We've had people go rogue, though, and start helping people. One chapter had a small civil war over it. We take our isolationism seriously.
AID00136613	What's the Codex?
AID00136614	Ah, the Codex. If it's in there, we have to abide it, if it's not, it's not important.
AID00136615	It documents our history, too. Part of what Scribes like me do is update it. Hmm... I wonder...
AID00136616	Nah, they'd probably catch it if I rewrote the Founder's axioms.
AID00136617	Do you like being a member?
AID00136618	I know sometimes I sound like I don't. I know. But there's something that still rings true to me about our code.
AID00136619	There's an honor to it. We're protecting people. Even if it's from themselves, it's a good cause.
AID00136620	We just lose sight of the big picture sometimes. Treat all our practices with the same sacredness.
AID00136621	What do you do for them?
AID00136622	I'm a procurement specialist. Like I said, it's basically grocery shopping. Except sometimes the groceries are scavenged parts and arcane technology.
AID00136623	The elder who brought us to the Mojave, Father Elijah, usually had me looking for these old memory units. But he'd never tell me what they were for.
AID00136624	Nowadays I'm usually sent to do business with traders at places like the 188. But sometimes I think it's just to keep me out of everyone's hair.
AID00136625	How did you get to be a member?
AID00136626	More sexual favors than I can even count. I am still tired from it.
AID00136627	No, actually, you're born into it. My parents, their parents, so on. When you're young you can choose to leave. But it's home, so most people don't.
AID00136628	We don't take on new members, really. You can do the math on our long-term prospects based on that point. I keep hoping we'll change that.
AID00136629	What's their purpose?
AID00136630	Ha! Good question. These days it's hard to say. Once upon a time it was about technology. Controlling it so it couldn't destroy us again.
AID00136631	Energy weapons and power armor are usually tops on our list, although I appreciate anything that's vintage.
AID00136632	But that all seems so limited now. We haven't grown or adapted. And now we're stuck in a hole, not carrying out our mission.
AID00136633	Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00136634	It pays like ass, but it's hard to get other work with my skill set.
AID00136635	What do you want to know?
AID00136636	VDialogueVeronicaGiftShopReact
AID00136637	I don't like the sound of this. Hope that collar isn't what I think it is. What did you do, Elijah?
AID00136638	Never mind.
AID00136639	Okay, I won't!
AID00136640	I wanted to talk about the technology we're looking for.
AID00136641	What are your thoughts?
AID00136642	He probably ditched you for someone cuter.
AID00136643	Why would you say something like that? That's just mean.
AID00136644	Just leave me alone.
AID00136645	Maybe he's down in the barracks.
AID00136646	He isn't. I already checked there this morning. We were supposed to meet up here about an hour ago.
AID00136647	I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
AID00136648	I haven't seen him.
AID00136649	Okay, well... I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
AID00136650	I've brought new security codes for this station's radio from Sergeant Reyes.
AID00136651	Simple enough to change. I doubt the Legion's listening in on us - they're not that sophisticated - but better safe than sorry, right?
AID00136652	Goodbye.
AID00136653	See you around.
AID00136654	I brought updated radio security codes from Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00136655	Oh. Uh... well, yeah, I can do that. Um, thanks.
AID00136656	The Rangers' versions of the reports they sent to Camp Golf don't match what you received.
AID00136657	I knew it. Every one of the false reports was signed off by Chief Hanlon at Camp Golf, but why would the Chief manipulate the reports?
AID00136658	I need you to take everything we've found to Chief Hanlon and confront him with it. I don't want to make this public unless we have to.
AID00136659	I knew it. I suspected that Chief Hanlon was behind all this, but since he's dead, there's no way we'll ever know.
AID00136660	Thanks for all your help.
AID00136661	I don't have time to do this right now.
AID00136662	All right, then. Come and talk to me when you do.
AID00136663	I'll investigate and let you know what I find out about those odd reports.
AID00136664	Thank you, and good luck.
AID00136665	What else did you need me to do?
AID00136666	We've received some disturbing reports from some of the Ranger stations - heavy casualties at Alpha, Super Mutant Legionaries at Delta.
AID00136667	The weirdest one has to be the Great Khans and their trained Deathclaws at Foxtrot. These reports can't be accurate. Can they?
AID00136668	I know you've already been out there, but could you do me a solid and confirm these reports with the Rangers who sent them in?
AID00136669	Every station except Charlie has been given the new security codes. Charlie was wiped out.
AID00136670	The station's been silent for quite some time now... I guess this confirms what we've all feared. Thanks for letting me know.
AID00136671	I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
AID00136672	Before you go, I've got another job available.
AID00136673	All of the Ranger stations have been given the new security codes.
AID00136674	Glad to hear it! I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
AID00136675	Before you go, I've got another job available.
AID00136676	I'll help. Tell me what I need to do.
AID00136677	This holotape contains the updated security codes for the Ranger Stations. Show it to the comm officers there.
AID00136678	Once the new codes are in use, anyone still using the old codes will just hear static if they're listening in on our frequencies.
AID00136679	What makes you think you can trust me with security codes?
AID00136680	The security codes are unique to the radios at each Ranger station. They're useless anywhere else.
AID00136681	Goodbye.
AID00136682	Bye.
AID00136683	Goodbye.
AID00136684	See you around.
AID00136685	I've brought radio security code updates from Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00136686	Very well. You can tell Reyes that this station is secure.
AID00136687	Goodbye.
AID00136688	So long.
AID00136689	Goodbye.
AID00136690	Carry on.
AID00136691	I have updated radio security codes from Sergeant Reyes here.
AID00136692	What, again? Didn't I just change those damn things? All right, fine - show me the new codes.
AID00136693	Goodbye.
AID00136694	Yeah.
AID00136695	Tilden mentioned you had surplus ammo. Mind if I have some?
AID00136696	You're not stationed here, but your rep with the NCR speaks for itself. It's mostly rifle rounds, but I'll throw in a few boxes of pistol ammo.
AID00136697	I really shouldn't be doing this for you, but there's no way we're going to use all of this or be able to carry it with us.
AID00136698	Sorry, it's against regulation for me to give away NCR supplies to anyone not stationed at this post. Wouldn't want you using it against us.
AID00136699	Since you have extra, could I have some of that ammo?
AID00136700	Eh, it's not my call to make. You'd have to clear it with Ranger Ericsen.
AID00136701	How are your water supplies right now?
AID00136702	We're not going to die of thirst any time soon, but I'd rather have too much than not enough.
AID00136703	Why don't you use your radio to fix your supply situation?
AID00136704	You think I haven't tried? Every time I do, Camp Golf acknowledges the situation. And soon after that, more ammo.
AID00136705	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136706	All right.
AID00136707	Goodbye.
AID00136708	Careful out there.
AID00136709	Goodbye.
AID00136710	Don't get killed out there.
AID00136711	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136712	Reyes got the numbers wrong - not much more to it than that.
AID00136713	How could Reyes have been wrong?
AID00136714	There are other Ranger posts around. Reyes might have mixed up the report.
AID00136715	What do you do here?
AID00136716	Ranger Station Alpha used to be the frontline outpost for NCR. When we moved onto the Dam, this station has fallen into more a support role.
AID00136717	Goodbye.
AID00136718	So long.
AID00136719	VMS52HeardHanlonSuicide
AID00136720	That shot came from the Chief's office!
AID00136721	VMS52SawHanlonSuicide
AID00136722	Chief! Why did you do it?
AID00136723	What were you doing in prison?
AID00136724	Goodbye.
AID00136725	Let's talk about something else.
AID00136726	Tell me about the prison break.
AID00136727	Tell me again what you want me to do?
AID00136728	Let's get back to business.
AID00136729	Let's get back to business.
AID00136730	Seriously, I'm not interested.
AID00136731	Until you do this, consider yourself suspended... without pay.
AID00136732	I think I'll sit this one out.
AID00136733	This is not an optional assignment. Kimball may be a grandstanding boor, but I want him protected.
AID00136734	Let me ask some questions.
AID00136735	Vouche for me? How?
AID00136736	I'll send a Securitron ahead to meet with the NCR at the security checkpoint and get things started.
AID00136737	Once you get there ask for Ranger Grant. I've used roaming Securitrons to feed him useful information in the past.
AID00136738	If I tell him we've heard of a Legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
AID00136739	What should I do in the meantime?
AID00136740	Whatever happens, happens.
AID00136741	Success depends on forethought, dispassionate calculation of probabilites, accounting for every stray variable.
AID00136742	Your history of aggression towards the NCR has rendered you useless in this concern, unable to influence the outcome of events.
AID00136743	Consequently, I have to "wait and see" what happens. It's... grotesque.
AID00136744	I have some questions to ask.
AID00136745	Like I said, I'll think about it.
AID00136746	You're making me question your usefulness, you realize.
AID00136747	I'll do as you ask.
AID00136748	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00136749	Sure, off to the dam I go.
AID00136750	I'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
AID00136751	CraigBooneVictimSpeechFail
AID00136752	No confession? No evidence? What good is that?

AID00136846	WoooooOOOOOOoooooo
AID00136847	Check your weapons and move up!
AID00136848	Move up to the next position.
AID00136849	WooooOOOOOOoooo.
AID00136850	You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
AID00136851	Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
AID00136852	Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
AID00136853	All clear!
AID00136854	Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
AID00136855	That looks like all of them.
AID00136856	I think it is safe to move up.
AID00136857	Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
AID00136858	Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
AID00136859	Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
AID00136860	You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
AID00136861	Sneaking around at night is a little suspicious.
AID00136862	I'm not sneaking! I'm uh... just stretching my legs. I should be getting back though, it's late. Goodnight.
AID00136863	I'm just enjoying a late night stroll.
AID00136864	Yeah, yeah... me too. It's getting a bit late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
AID00136865	I could ask you the same thing.
AID00136866	Uh... I was just... uh... getting some fresh air and stretching my legs. It's getting pretty late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
AID00136867	I saw you stealing Dr. Richard's medical supplies.
AID00136868	Does the Legion know you're watching them from here?
AID00136869	Undoubtedly. Rangers are tough nuts to crack, though, and any force small enough to launch a surprise attack isn't going back in one piece.
AID00136870	On the other hand, if the Legion goes for a full-scale attack, we'll see 'em coming, fall back, and wait for reinforcements.
AID00136871	So, we know what they'll do and they know what we'll do, so we just sit around and keep an eye on each other.
AID00136872	The NCR is letting the Legion get away with slavery?
AID00136873	Believe me, I would love orders to take Cottonwood Cove apart and kick the Legion back across the river.
AID00136874	But, the brass at McCarran doesn't want us to waste resources on something they consider a minor target. So we just get to watch.
AID00136875	Never mind.
AID00136876	Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136877	1000 chips for 1000 caps.
AID00136878	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136879	500 chips for 500 caps.
AID00136880	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136881	100 chips for 100 caps.
AID00136882	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136883	20 chips for 20 caps.
AID00136884	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136885	5 chips for 5 caps.
AID00136886	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136887	1 chip for 1 cap.
AID00136888	Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
AID00136889	I'd like to exchange caps for chips.
AID00136890	How many chips would you like?
AID00136891	Try to throw me out and you'll be leaving - in pieces.
AID00136892	Jesus Christ!
AID00136893	Fuck off, creep, I'm not going anywhere.
AID00136894	Fine, then, you want to play rough? We'll play rough!
AID00136895	Sure, okay, I'm out of here.
AID00136896	Smart move, kid. We're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
AID00136897	What? Why?
AID00136898	Let's be straight, baby: there's lucky and there's *too* lucky. You keep up like this and you're gonna break the bank.
AID00136899	Now, we're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
AID00136900	I have a dog tag for you.
AID00136901	Thank you, every tag you bring me is one more soldier at peace.
AID00136902	I see you're wearing an NCR dog tag.
AID00136903	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
AID00136904	Why are you still here?
AID00136905	You aren't feral, are you?
AID00136906	I'm gone, then. Thanks for all the money.
AID00136907	What? Why?
AID00136908	You've taken us for a ride, and we want you out.
AID00136909	All right, I'm going.
AID00136910	You're free to enjoy the shows and the bar, but no more games for you at The Tops. Thanks for playing.
AID00136911	What was that about the surplus ammo?
AID00136912	We keep getting deliveries of ammunition for some reason. I don't mind target practice, but there isn't all that much to shoot at out here.
AID00136913	What is this place?
AID00136914	Ranger Station Charlie. We're responsible for keeping the highway up through Novac civilized.
AID00136915	What was that about McCarran?
AID00136916	Radio signal out here can be pretty spotty because of all the hills. Sometimes our scheduled updates don't go through.
AID00136917	When it happens enough times, they send someone over to check up on us. Lately, we've been getting extra medical supplies for some reason.
AID00136918	I'm in no rush to give the supplies back, either.
AID00136919	Lenk told me her story.
AID00136920	Yeah, it's a damn shame. There was a lot of talk about expelling her from the Rangers, especially once the gambling and drinking started.
AID00136921	Being posted here is her second and last chance, and so far, I'm not impressed. Lenk's jumpy all the time, and the others are sick of it.
AID00136922	Pathetic. The Rangers should never have let you become one in the first place.
AID00136923	I... I was different back then.
AID00136924	Interesting. Let's move on to something else.
AID00136925	Yeah.
AID00136926	You were too tough to kill, and you'll get payback on the Legion some day.
AID00136927	Maybe. But, thanks for saying it, anyway.
AID00136928	< Speech 30 >
AID00136929	[SUCCEEDED] We were on patrol near the Dam when a Legion raiding party jumped us. Didn't even have to time to radio it in.
AID00136930	I was hit in the head with a machete and knocked out. Didn't kill me, though some nights I wish it had. When I woke up, my nerve was gone.
AID00136931	The rest of my squad was crucified, butchered, mutilated. I don't know how they missed me. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew they'd broken me.
AID00136932	I gambled and drank a lot after that. Got into trouble, but the Rangers gave me a second chance instead of kicking me out. So, here I am.
AID00136933	If you don't tell me, someone else will. I'd rather hear your version.
AID00136934	[FAILED] No, I'm not going to bring it up.
AID00136935	You sure? I'd love to hear that story.
AID00136936	Fine. Let's talk about something else.
AID00136937	Yes.
AID00136938	I thought NCR Rangers were supposed to be tough and fearless.
AID00136939	I... don't want to talk about it.
AID00136940	What do you know about the Great Khans?
AID00136941	Tough, independent, and as ruthless as they come. They're holed up in Red Rock Canyon, and it's this station's job to keep an eye on them.
AID00136942	I need to confirm your report about Great Khans with trained Deathclaws.
AID00136943	You must be mistaken - I haven't filed any report like that. Trained deathclaws? I would have remembered that.
AID00136944	If someone is saying I filed that report, that's a load of crap. I won't have my name attached to a clerical error.
AID00136945	Goodbye.
AID00136946	Be careful out there.
AID00136947	What happened between you and the Omertas?
AID00136948	I talked to the cashier at Gomorrah into forwarding me some chips - I was convinced I was due for a hot streak.
AID00136949	It, uh, didn't go so well. The Omertas were nice and said they'd give me some time to pay them back.
AID00136950	They also said if they had to talk to me about my debt again, they wouldn't be nice the next time.
AID00136951	<Lie> I'm here because of your debt to the Omertas. Pay me what you've got and you'll get more time.
AID00136952	Here's all the caps I've saved up so far. See? That's a pretty good chunk of what I owe right there!
AID00136953	Goodbye.
AID00136954	Watch out for Great Khans.
AID00136955	Mind if I take some of those extra medical supplies?
AID00136956	Something tells me this isn't the first time you've done things that the NCR would find... objectionable.
AID00136957	Here, take some of these. And don't tell anyone where you got them.
AID00136958	I shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and I'd rather not get you into the habit of crossing the NCR.
AID00136959	Has there been much fighting around here?
AID00136960	Skirmishes, mostly. The Legion raiding parties usually fall back when they know it's us they're up against.
AID00136961	Why do you need reinforcements?
AID00136962	The Legion's been sending raiding parties across the river in larger numbers lately. We don't have the men at this post to intercept them all.
AID00136963	I'm still working on the Boomers.
AID00136964	I expect results sooner rather than later.
AID00136965	I should be going.
AID00136966	How do you know so much about me?
AID00136967	What are you saying I have to do?
AID00136968	I should be going.
AID00136969	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
AID00136970	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
AID00136971	What are you saying I have to do?
AID00136972	How do you know so much about me?
AID00136973	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
AID00136974	Oh, I'll give you the Platinum Chip. And then you'll use it exactly like I tell you to.
AID00136975	I should be going.
AID00136976	I should be going.
AID00136977	You should be listening, that's what you should be doing.
AID00136978	That's right, you should be going - because you have work to do.
AID00136979	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
AID00136980	Benny is my prisoner. You don't "deal with him" unless you've dealt with me.
AID00136981	Don't worry, you'll get the Platinum Chip he was carrying. And then you'll use it like I tell you to.
AID00136982	I won't fight for the Legion.
AID00136983	What did you just say?
AID00136984	That's enough questions for now.
AID00136985	What else, then?
AID00136986	I apologize for my failure, mighty Caesar. It will not happen again.
AID00136987	That's right. Under normal circumstances, the reason it wouldn't happen again is that you'd be crucified - or worse.
AID00136988	Only in light of the extraordinary service you've rendered unto me am I going to overlook this failure.
AID00136989	Bear in mind how much you have to make up for, how much you have to prove yourself in your next task...
AID00136990	I've committed no other crimes.
AID00136991	Understand this. From this moment forward, any other crimes will be punished by death. No exceptions.
AID00136992	I will have you hacked into pieces by my Praetorians - for my amusement. Understand?
AID00136993	Now getting back to business...
AID00136994	I defused the bomb on the monorail.
AID00136995	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at Camp McCarran? What else have you done?
AID00136996	The Legionaries at Nelson attacked me, so I had to fight back...
AID00136997	And so you wiped out the garrison I placed at Nelson? That strategically vital garrison? What else?
AID00136998	I may have disrupted plans to recruit the Great Khans to your cause.
AID00136999	Weeks of effort to convince those miserable Khans to join the Legion - ruined. Any other crimes?
AID00137000	I killed the Omertas who were scheming to attack the Strip.
AID00137001	Months spent feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal - all for nothing. Any other crimes?
AID00137002	I'm still working on the White Glove Society.
AID00137003	Then get to it.
AID00137004	There's no way the White Glove Society will be cannibals again - I've already seen to that.
AID00137005	You've been resourceful in the past. Why are you a failure now?
AID00137006	You'd best step up your performance with this next assignment...
AID00137007	The White Glove Society has agreed to an alliance with Caesar's Legion.
AID00137008	Good. It will be valuable to have allies on the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken. Now, as for your next assignment...
AID00137009	The cannibals among the White Glove Society are dead.
AID00137010	They'll be of no use to the Legion, then.
AID00137011	You squandered a potentially valuable resource. Do better with your next assignment or there will be trouble...
AID00137012	The White Glove Society won't listen to me - I've caused them too much trouble.
AID00137013	So what you're telling me is, you're useless. You have no ability to influence events, so I'm forced to work around your incompetence.
AID00137014	Try to do better with your next assignment...
AID00137015	The Boomers hate me. They'll never follow my lead.
AID00137016	Then you'll have to be extraordinarily persuasive. Or kill them - their leaders, at least.
AID00137017	Get to it, will you? You're wasting my time.
AID00137018	I've won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
AID00137019	Good. Make sure they help the Legion when the time comes. As for your next assignment...
AID00137020	I had to wipe out the Boomers' leaders.
AID00137021	A perfectly satisfactory way of resolving the threat they posed. It's impressive that you made it through their barrage.
AID00137022	Now, as for your next assignment...
AID00137023	I'm done working for you.
AID00137024	Mark my words, you piece of shit. This is the last time you will ever refuse to perform an order I've given you.
AID00137025	If you meant what you said, you best be on your way, and at good speed. And forget all that I could have given you.
AID00137026	If you ever - ever - disobey me again, I will order my Praetorians to hack you to death with their machetes for my entertainment.
AID00137027	I warned you about the price of disobedience. I guess you weren't listening.
AID00137028	Praetorians! Kill this nuisance!
AID00137029	Why must Mr. House be killed?
AID00137030	Because he complicates the equation of force. He's a free agent, an unpredictable element.
AID00137031	I'm sure he's trying to sit out this battle, just as he did four years ago, hoping the Legion and Profligates will wipe each other out.
AID00137032	When he sees the Profligates losing this battle, however, he might throw his support behind them. Except he won't, because he'll be dead.
AID00137033	I have some questions to ask.
AID00137034	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137035	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137036	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137037	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137038	What should I expect at the dam?
AID00137039	Lanius will be waiting for you. Your arrival will signal to him that it's time to launch the attack.
AID00137040	As for what to expect, it's going to be the greatest battle - and victory - mankind has seen since it almost wiped itself off the face of this Earth.
AID00137041	Tactically, it's simple - kill and kill some more. I may have a few surprises in store for the NCR, but that won't concern you.
AID00137042	Are your bodyguards special in any way?
AID00137043	My Praetorians embody the martial ideals of my Legion. Each one of them has done enough conquering and killing to deserve the rank of Centurion.
AID00137044	Instead, I invited them to join my guard. So the invitee chooses whichever current guard he thinks is weakest - and challenges him.
AID00137045	The fight is to the death. It keeps them from getting complacent.
AID00137046	Lucius has been the head of my guard for five years now. He was a subordinate guard for eight before that.
AID00137047	No invitee has dared to challenge him yet. Maybe it's an issue of respect - he is getting on in years.
AID00137048	How long has Lucius been the head of your Praetorians?
AID00137049	Tell me about Vulpes Inculta.
AID00137050	Vulpes is the best of my Frumentarii. A remarkable individual from an unremarkable tribe south of the Utah.
AID00137051	He was brought into the Legion as a boy, survived training, fought well enough as Legionary to be promoted to the rank of Decanus.
AID00137052	Then, in battle against an unimportant tribe, he broke ranks and led his contubernium through a hole in their defenses to capture its chieftain.
AID00137053	Well, his Centurion wanted him crucified for disobedience. So I made him a Frumentari.
AID00137054	Whatever I require. Infiltration, assassination, dramatic atrocities to break the spirit of the enemy - et cetera.
AID00137055	They're mentally flexible. They operate behind enemy lines for extended periods, imitating the enemy's customs without becoming sullied.
AID00137056	In all these things, Vulpes is a master.
AID00137057	What do the Frumentarii do?
AID00137058	I've heard rumors of your legate, Lanius. What's his story?
AID00137059	Lanius is the greatest of my battlefield commanders. Some might call him a great man, but I'm not sure he qualifies.
AID00137060	Once, he was the greatest warrior of the Hidebarks, a tribe of the Arizona. Maniacal in battle. Sometimes he'd ambush Legion patrols by himself.
AID00137061	When, after several months we found and surrounded the Hidebarks' camp, their Chieftain raised a banner of surrender.
AID00137062	The warrior who was not yet Lanius went insane with rage. He struck down his Chieftain and attacked his own tribe.
AID00137063	He killed fifteen before they brought him down. He didn't die, obviously.
AID00137064	I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
AID00137065	When he did, I went to his bedside and showed him the helmet I'd had forged to cover his face. I said he could have it if he'd fight for me.
AID00137066	He accepted... on condition that he be allowed to kill the surviving males of his tribe. I said, make it the adult males and you have a deal.
AID00137067	What happened when Lanius attacked his own tribe?
AID00137068	Lanius is savage. Savagely loyal, too, but only to me - he has no love for my Legion. But this has its uses.
AID00137069	He has no attachment to his men, no compunction about battlefield losses. All he cares about is destroying the enemy.
AID00137070	When another legatus or a Centurion fails to achieve results, I send Lanius to make things right.
AID00137071	His first step is to beat the failed commander to death in front of his assembled troops. Then he orders the ritual of decimatio.
AID00137072	He sounds more like a savage than a general.
AID00137073	It means "decimation," but in ancient Rome the word had a very specific meaning - a punishment for cowardice.
AID00137074	The Legionaries are lined up in ranks. Every tenth man steps forward and is beaten to death by his brothers.
AID00137075	It instills a certain... robust obedience.
AID00137076	What is "decimatio?"
AID00137077	Yes. This time my Legionaries will be more frightened of the commander behind them than the enemy before them.
AID00137078	There will be no failure this time, no retreat, no years of gathering slaves and resources for another assault.
AID00137079	With Lanius to drive the Legion forward, the dam will be taken. It will be our bridgehead across the Colorado.
AID00137080	Lanius will lead the assault on Hoover Dam?
AID00137081	It's not going to happen again. That's all I have to say about it.
AID00137082	Why did the Legion lose the first battle?
AID00137083	And I've heard it's a bad idea to tempt the wrath of Caesar. Change the subject.
AID00137084	I've heard the commander of the first battle called "The Burned Man."
AID00137085	What's your opinion of President Kimball?
AID00137086	A man of potential, held back by the craven political context he inhabits. You realize he was a general? "The Hero of the Mojave," they called him.
AID00137087	A title he earned by extirpating lesser tribes that dared attack NCR citizens. His responses were swift and draconian.
AID00137088	President Tandi, the "founding mother," coddled hostile tribes... but her successors were less naive, so they gave Kimball free rein.
AID00137089	And after a respectable military career, what does he do? Become a politician.
AID00137090	But he did so by election. What better way to stunt the growth of leaders, not to mention whole cultures?
AID00137091	A leader shouldn't have to kowtow to those who serve him. With so much energy wasted on those below, how is he ever to move forward?
AID00137092	Had he taken the government by force, used his army to stage a coup, things would be very different.
AID00137093	I'll just have to do it for him.
AID00137094	Isn't it natural for someone like Kimball to seek greater power?
AID00137095	It'll frighten them. If I can reach out and kill whomever I choose, then they know the only reason they're alive is I haven't tried yet.
AID00137096	You have to understand that Kimball is a symbol. Without him, there would be no NCR occupation of the Mojave.
AID00137097	He mustered the troops - as many as his senate would allow - and sent them in. All the right reasons, done all the wrong ways.
AID00137098	Any invasion by a democracy is a half-measure. When Kimball dies, the NCR will recoil from the Mojave, and from his legacy.
AID00137099	By the time they recover and try to strike back, I'll be invading them.
AID00137100	How will the NCR react to Kimball's death? Won't it just anger them?
AID00137101	What do you think of the Brotherhood of Steel?
AID00137102	The worst impulses of mankind, concentrated in one insane, backward tribe.
AID00137103	The Brotherhood seems to have formed not long after the great atomic war. It's hard to know - they care little for history.
AID00137104	Some of the Brotherhood scribes we captured further East didn't even know the name of their founder, Roger Maxson.
AID00137105	They like to pretty up their mission with trappings of chivalry, but the truth is they're horders. They horde technology.
AID00137106	It's been 200 years, and they still have the mentality of scavengers. They say they're preserving these technologies, but for what?
AID00137107	They have no vision. They offer no future. They're a dead end.
AID00137108	You don't think very far ahead, do you?
AID00137109	Sure, their hatred of the NCR would seem to qualify them for use as proxies. But then what do you do with them? Each paladin is quite powerful.
AID00137110	I'd have to be convinced that present benefits outweighed future costs.
AID00137111	Couldn't you use the Brotherhood to your advantage?
AID00137112	Tell me about the Boomers.
AID00137113	The Boomers settled at the old air base northeast of Vegas many years ago. No one knows exactly how long it's been.
AID00137114	It may be that no one's traded with them or even spoken to them that entire time. If so, they're sitting on one hell of a stockpile of ammunition...
AID00137115	My scouts have seen people moving around the base. The perimeter is guarded, with spotters in towers directing the artillery fire.
AID00137116	They must have extraordinary vision. Some of my scouts were targeted at extreme distances.
AID00137117	So no, I can't tell you what to expect inside the base. No one's been inside it, except them.
AID00137118	Don't you know anything about their society?
AID00137119	You should use Mr. House's technology to attack the dam.
AID00137120	You don't get it, do you? The weapons I wield are forged from blood, flesh, sinew, bone - mortal stuff. Fragile, even.
AID00137121	And yet my Legion obeys me, even unto death. Why? Because they live to serve the greater good, and they know of no alternatives.
AID00137122	House's machines, his technologies - what do they propose? The possibility of victory without sacrifice. No blood spilled, just... rivets.
AID00137123	That's not an idea to be put in circulation. If mankind's going to survive this moment in history, it needs warriors, not gadgets.
AID00137124	Maybe Benny could do this for you.
AID00137125	I wouldn't trust Benny to lick my boots clean. This one falls to you.
AID00137126	Can't your Legionaries take care of this?
AID00137127	Yes. But then I'd have to kill them.
AID00137128	What's on the other side of those doors?
AID00137129	Benny's theory, if I understood it through all the screaming, was that Mr. House stashed some kind of ultimate weapon down there.
AID00137130	A gigantic robot to stomp us all to death, who cares? Whatever it is, House built it, so I want it destroyed.
AID00137131	I don't know. And I don't like not knowing.
AID00137132	I know Mr. House built it. I'm thinking it's probably some kind of weapon that he can't activate from a distance.
AID00137133	How do you know so much about me?
AID00137134	I have eyes and ears everywhere. It behooves me not to invade the west blind and deaf.
AID00137135	It hasn't been hard to track your progress. It's not as though you've been keeping a low profile.
AID00137136	What do I have to do?
AID00137137	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
AID00137138	What were you looking to start?
AID00137139	The time is fast approaching when my Legion will assault the great dam and invade the west.
AID00137140	Before that happens, I want Mr. House knocked out of the game, a quick one-two punch - with you doing the punching.
AID00137141	Before that happens, I want Mr. House erased from the picture. Not just the man you killed, but what he left behind. His legacy.
AID00137142	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
AID00137143	How may I serve your Legion, Caesar?
AID00137144	I like the servile attitude. Keep it up.
AID00137145	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED NCR.>
AID00137146	You spread word of the massacre of Nipton, just like Vulpes asked you.
AID00137147	Beams of light shot down from the sky over HELIOS One, killing who knows how many Profligate troops.
AID00137148	Silus, the Centurion who let himself get captured, died at McCarran before he could reveal sensitive information.
AID00137149	You freed the Centurion Silus from McCarran so that he might be punished for his cowardice.
AID00137150	The monorail that the Profligates rode from McCarran to the Strip has been destroyed.
AID00137151	You turned Camp Forlorn Hope into a mass grave.
AID00137152	Chief Hanlon, a nemesis of my Legion, died the humiliating death he deserved.
AID00137153	In Boulder City, you let the renegade Khans go free, but left NCR troopers gurgling on the ground, drowning in their own blood.
AID00137154	A number of NCR Ranger stations have been wiped off the face of the Mojave, thanks to you.
AID00137155	The Profligates still hate me more than they hate you, I think, but I've been at this longer than you have.
AID00137156	I get it. We share a common enemy. And now you come before the mighty Caesar to what - offer your services?
AID00137157	<Inert Node to hold lines for how player has troubled Legion.>
AID00137158	Vulpes Inculta, the best of my frumentarii, is dead.
AID00137159	All the bribes I sent to the Omertas ended up buying me nothing.
AID00137160	The Great Khans aren't exactly clamoring to fight for my Legion now.
AID00137161	The garrison I established at Nelson has been wiped out.
AID00137162	Years of meticulous scheming to place a mole at Camp McCarran - wasted.
AID00137163	The Kings of Freeside are cooperating with the NCR now, which frees up soldiers to defend the dam.
AID00137164	You even disrupted a promising weapons deal with the Van Graffs.
AID00137165	Is it any wonder my Legion has so little love for you?
AID00137166	So tell me this, because I really want to know. I am feared - with good reason.
AID00137167	But you - of all people - dare to come here and stand before me, the mighty Caesar. What were you thinking?
AID00137168	That I'd decorate this tent with your guts.
AID00137169	Praetorians, to me!
AID00137170	Death to tyrants! <Start combat.>
AID00137171	Praetorians, to arms!
AID00137172	I had to see the Mighty Caesar with my own eyes.
AID00137173	Maybe I should have you struck blind so my face is the last sight you ever behold. Look...
AID00137174	You're in possession of something that interests me.
AID00137175	We'll deal with Benny when the time comes. In the meantime...
AID00137176	We'll talk about the Platinum Chip when the time comes. In the meantime...
AID00137177	I need to get that Platinum Chip back.
AID00137178	You guaranteed my safety.
AID00137179	And you fell for that? Really? Because I'm going to have you killed now.
AID00137180	You do know why I wanted to meet you, right?
AID00137181	A man nearly kills you, so you track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
AID00137182	You arrive on the Strip and waltz into the Lucky 38 like someone left you a key under the doormat?
AID00137183	You assassinate the head of the Chairmen in his own casino - and get away with it?
AID00137184	You visit the Tops, and next thing you know, the head of the Chairmen is fleeing the Strip like a whimpering little pup?
AID00137185	Then something happens to Mr. House's robots - some kind of military upgrade?
AID00137186	But the topper, the coup de gr鈉e? Mr. House dies - while you're visiting him at the Lucky 38.
AID00137187	When you set your mind to something, you get results. I like that.
AID00137188	...Relax. I'm fucking with you.
AID00137189	Mr. House sent me to infiltrate your camp.
AID00137190	Mission accomplished, asshole. I never would've suspected a thing if you hadn't told me - but now I'll have to have you killed.
AID00137191	What do you do here?
AID00137192	I'm in charge of the radio - hence the title "Comm Officer." I'd much rather be out on patrol, since nothing much happens around here.
AID00137193	Goodbye.
AID00137194	Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
AID00137195	Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.
AID00137196	Return to me when you've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00137197	Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
AID00137198	Complete your mission, then return to me.
AID00137199	Vale.
AID00137200	Nevermind, I'll be back.
AID00137201	All right, come back any time.
AID00137202	Any interesting places around here?
AID00137203	Have you ever heard the story of the bomber that crashed into the lake before the War? Supposedly it's mostly intact, even after all that time.
AID00137204	Forget about it. It's over.
AID00137205	Oh. Well, thanks for helping get to the bottom of this, I guess.
AID00137206	What do you do here?
AID00137207	I handle communications for Camp Forlorn Hope, compiling reports I've received from the Rangers at Camp Golf as well as the brass at McCarran.
AID00137208	Unofficially, I'm also in charge of radio security. No one else seems to take it as seriously as I do.
AID00137209	Have you heard anything unusual about any of the other Ranger stations?
AID00137210	Nothing as severe. Charlie seems to be getting a lot of extra medical supplies for some reason, while Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in awhile.
AID00137211	Echo has been reporting heavy Legion activity down on their end, but that's about it.
AID00137212	Not without out fight. <Attack.>
AID00137213	Good thing you're wearing a skirt, makes pissing yourself go easier. <Attack.>
AID00137214	Brothers, help!
AID00137215	What's a Decanus?
AID00137216	My commander, you ignorant degenerate! Now, will you go before Dead Sea?
AID00137217	Yes, I'll go before your Decanus.
AID00137218	Follow me. Make any trouble, and you'll wind up on a cross - if you're lucky.
AID00137219	I'm just passing through.
AID00137220	The Legion will decide that, Profligate, not you. Will you go before my Decanus for judgement, or be killed where you stand?
AID00137221	I came seeking yours, skirt boy. <Attack.>
AID00137222	Brothers, help!
AID00137223	You just messed with the wrong gal. <Attack.>
AID00137224	Brothers! Attack!
AID00137225	You just messed with the wrong guy. <Attack.>
AID00137226	<Brothers! Attack!>
AID00137227	Easy, I'm a friend of the Legion.
AID00137228	Ah - you must be the courier who's been of service to us lately. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
AID00137229	I bear the Mark of Caesar.
AID00137230	Forgive my challenge. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
AID00137231	[PRESS DEMO] Enough gambling, more fighting. Take me to the no man's land near Camp Forlorn Hope.
AID00137232	You'll need someone to watch your back - Craig Boone, an NCR sniper, will be joining you. Keep your head down out there!
AID00137233	I'd like to know more about the Rangers.
AID00137234	Well, when there's trouble regular NCR troops can't handle, they send in a Ranger. Problem solved.
AID00137235	We're also responsible for keeping the borders of the NCR secure, scouting out threats, that sort of thing.
AID00137236	I'd like to know more about the NCR Rangers.
AID00137237	Best of the best, that's all there is to it. Really nothing more to say than that.
AID00137238	How does someone become a Ranger?
AID00137239	The Rangers mostly draw from the basic NCR army. A trooper who shows exceptional skill at fighting and scouting can be nominated for the training.
AID00137240	Are there a lot of Rangers in the Mojave?
AID00137241	Couple dozen, I'd say, most of them posted at stations like this one. We either man the station or patrol the immediate area.
AID00137242	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137243	Sure.
AID00137244	Tell me about the Rangers.
AID00137245	We're part scout, part commando, part sheriff. The training is brutal, and I'd say eight out of ten recruits washes out before the end.
AID00137246	Before you get your Ranger badge, you've got to prove you can be quieter than a shadow and more ferocious than a Deathclaw.
AID00137247	So, you're a Ranger?
AID00137248	For about ten years now. Toughest training I've ever done, and was the proudest day of my life when I got my Ranger badge.
AID00137249	Did you know that the first battle at Hoover Dam was won because of the Rangers? Legion had the numbers, but we had the skill.
AID00137250	Tell me about the Rangers.
AID00137251	I'm not really much of a historian. The short version is that the Rangers are the elite of the NCR military. Best fighters in the wasteland.
AID00137252	What is this place?
AID00137253	Ranger Station Alpha. Ranger Lineholm is in command here.
AID00137254	Goodbye.
AID00137255	Later.
AID00137256	Can I ask you some questions?
AID00137257	Shoot.
AID00137258	Goodbye.
AID00137259	Goodbye.
AID00137260	What's going on with the Great Khans?
AID00137261	One of my patrols was on its way back from Novac when it came under fire from the Great Khans.
AID00137262	They radioed for reinforcements, but instead of waiting for us, they chased the Khans into the ruins where they were caught in a crossfire.
AID00137263	No deaths, but not all of the squad got out. The Khans have Private Ackerman and Private Gilbert as hostages.
AID00137264	I had some questions.
AID00137265	I'm sure you have all the good dirt on what goes on around here.
AID00137266	I sure do, but loose lips sink ships.
AID00137267	<Speech Options>
AID00137268	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you look pretty trustworthy.
AID00137269	Don't worry about me, I can keep your secrets.
AID00137270	[FAILED] Sorry, but the Omertas don't look very kindly upon gossiping.
AID00137271	A little gossip never hurt anyone.
AID00137272	<Cherchez La Femme>
AID00137273	I... well, since you ask so nicely, and I'm not sure I could resist those pretty eyes. What do you want to know?
AID00137274	Beautiful, I would love to help you loosen those lips.
AID00137275	What can you tell me about what's going on around the Strip?
AID00137276	I've heard some pretty shady rumors about the Ultra Luxe.
AID00137277	I'm not sure what the deal is, but although they try to put on airs, that place is just plain creepy. Maybe it's the masks.
AID00137278	Not much of a rumor, but I hear the Tops is always looking for new talent. Lord knows they've needed it for a long time.
AID00137279	I'm not sure what's going on at Lucky 38. That place is weird. Nobody ever goes in. Nobody ever comes out.
AID00137280	I hear you've actually been inside Lucky 38? You're the first person who's been in there in as long as anybody can remember.
AID00137281	It's hard to believe that not too long ago most of the families on the Strip were little more than warring tribes.
AID00137282	The Omertas even had a big war with the Khans, once upon a time.
AID00137283	Sorry, that's all the news worth talking about. All I have at least.
AID00137284	What can you tell me about what's going on in Gomorrah?
AID00137285	Gossip is one thing, dirt on the Family is something else totally.
AID00137286	I knew someone would call in that mark soon. What do you want to know?
AID00137287	I'm calling in for an outstanding balance for some information. Tell me what the Omertas are up to.
AID00137288	That was one of my sisters, but my family always repays our debts. What do you want to know?
AID00137289	I'm calling in for an outstanding balance for some information. Tell me what the Omertas are up to.
AID00137290	Can you help me find someone?
AID00137291	Depends on who you're looking for.
AID00137292	I'm looking for Cachino.
AID00137293	Cachino is usually on this floor in Brimstone, having drinks. If he isn't there then he's probably in his room upstairs.
AID00137294	Can you tell me where Troike is?
AID00137295	Troike spends all his days down in Zoara on the lower level.
AID00137296	Troike is dead, but I'm sure you know that.
AID00137297	Do you know someone named Clanden?
AID00137298	Yeah. I know him. You'll probably find him in his room upstairs. He usually just sends down for girls or food.
AID00137299	I knew someone named Clanden. Good fucking riddance.
AID00137300	Where can I find the management?
AID00137301	Big Sal and Nero split their time in Zoara overlooking the main casino floor from the balcony. No one but Family is allowed up there, though.
AID00137302	I need to know who to talk to about what's been going on in Gomorrah.
AID00137303	All I can tell you is to find Cachino. He's the lowest level Lieutenant you're going to be able to talk to.
AID00137304	Some of the girls say he's been involved in some shady business the Family wouldn't really like. Ask him about it.
AID00137305	Tell me what the Family is up to.
AID00137306	Sorry, they don't tell me their plans and I don't want to know. I'm just happy they don't make me fuck anybody anymore.
AID00137307	Moore sent me to talk to you about the Omertas.
AID00137308	Ah, excellent. I received word you may be coming. We helped the receptionist over at Gomorrah with some thugs that were taking advantage of her.
AID00137309	She owes us a favor. Go talk to her, she'll be able to point you in the right direction.
AID00137310	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00137311	Fire away.
AID00137312	Goodbye.
AID00137313	Enjoy yourself.
AID00137314	Goodbye.
AID00137315	Be careful.
AID00137316	Well, I'm not, and I believe you have something of mine.
AID00137317	Yeah... about that...
AID00137318	Why did Benny betray you?
AID00137319	He's a snake, that's why. He owed us the rest of the pay for the job, so maybe he didn't want to pay up.
AID00137320	What do you know about the Platinum Chip?
AID00137321	Just a big, fancy poker chip as far as I know. Don't know why anyone would make one out of platinum, though.
AID00137322	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00137323	Fine.
AID00137324	What can you tell me about Benny?
AID00137325	He's one of the Chairmen, big shots who run The Tops casino in New Vegas. A friend from the city contacted me with info on a big job.
AID00137326	I should've known that the caps were too good to be true, but there was still no way I could pass up the chance.
AID00137327	I want some more answers.
AID00137328	Yeah? On what?
AID00137329	Where's the Platinum Chip?
AID00137330	Don't have it. Benny stole it, right before he stabbed us in the back. He's probably back at the Strip by now, laughing at me.
AID00137331	I got better.
AID00137332	And here I thought us Great Khans were tough to kill. So, what happens now?
AID00137333	All right, get ready.
AID00137334	What ya talking about? I been ready!
AID00137335	How about I bust you out?
AID00137336	About setting you free...
AID00137337	Goodbye, Benny.
AID00137338	Thanks for nothing, you fink!
AID00137339	Time to die.
AID00137340	You're next. Say your prayers.
AID00137341	What happens if I let you go?
AID00137342	Baby, that can go any direction you want. We can take Vegas together, or I can head for the nearest sunset. Your call.
AID00137343	I don't know how to open this cage...
AID00137344	I'm leaving you here.
AID00137345	Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll hoist me up on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
AID00137346	Here, I'll set you free. <Untie Benny.>
AID00137347	That's it, baby! Time to vacate these premises!
AID00137348	Actually... I'd rather kill you now.
AID00137349	You fink! Murdering me like this, down on my knees?
AID00137350	Okay, let's do it.
AID00137351	Ring-a-ding-ding, baby. I've got your back.
AID00137352	How about I untie you?
AID00137353	What am I gonna say? "No thanks?"
AID00137354	If you can get these ropes off, I'll do my best to take down my share of the guards.
AID00137355	We talked about how you might sneak out of here...
AID00137356	Yeah, we talked about it, but that went a big fat nowhere.
AID00137357	It's too late for that, baby. This decision you gotta make is going down now. So what's it gonna be?
AID00137358	VDialogueBennyFreedAmbush
AID00137359	Thanks for getting me outta that cage! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
AID00137360	No one rules Vegas except me, got it? You're a lowdown gofer! You deliver mail!
AID00137361	How ya like being Mister Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
AID00137362	How ya like being Miss Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
AID00137363	Keep dreaming.
AID00137364	If I help you escape, what will you do next?
AID00137365	I'll see what I can do.
AID00137366	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need.
AID00137367	About helping you escape...
AID00137368	Yeah? What about it?
AID00137369	Keep dreaming.
AID00137370	I'll see what I can do.
AID00137371	Check's in the mail, hey? Don't get my hopes up.
AID00137372	Keep dreaming.
AID00137373	No one likes a tease, baby.
AID00137374	Then stop bringing it up!
AID00137375	You're not getting out of that cage.
AID00137376	If I help you escape, what will you do next?
AID00137377	Baby, if you show me the door to scramsville, that's where I'll go - out of your hair, never to return.
AID00137378	I been a fink to you, caused more than my share of grief by a hard mile. Let me go, you won't see me again.
AID00137379	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need to escape.
AID00137380	Baby... your generosity and spirit of forgiveness? Off the charts.
AID00137381	This little care package is everything I need. I'll take it from here.
AID00137382	What if I helped you escape?
AID00137383	Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
AID00137384	Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
AID00137385	I know I been bad, but it's cruel to jerk me around like this...
AID00137386	Like I said, baby, all Benny needs is a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin.
AID00137387	VDialogueBennyWatchesFight
AID00137388	That's it, baby! Show these punks what you got!
AID00137389	Groovy, baby! Plant these losers in the ground!
AID00137390	That's it - sock it to the Legion, baby!
AID00137391	Keep it up! Show these finks what's what!
AID00137392	They got nothing on you, baby! Keep it up!
AID00137393	Yeah! Give these Praetorian bums the big send-off, baby!
AID00137394	More complications. Just what I needed.
AID00137395	Forget what I said. Kill them all.
AID00137396	I don't like it, but orders are orders.
AID00137397	If you have any integrity, then you'll honor the deal.
AID00137398	You're right. The Great Khans are free to go.
AID00137399	About that bribe...
AID00137400	500 caps was the amount requested.
AID00137401	We agreed on 400 caps.
AID00137402	I'm a ghost, here to haunt you. Oooooh...
AID00137403	All right, quit fucking around. You survived and you tracked us down. What now?
AID00137404	I don't have the caps with me right now.
AID00137405	I'll be back with the caps.
AID00137406	Here's the caps.
AID00137407	This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
AID00137408	I'll consider your offer.
AID00137409	< Barter 45 >
AID00137410	[SUCCEEDED] That makes sense, and it's still more than these troopers see in a month.
AID00137411	400 caps is a less suspicious amount. You have enough trouble here as it is.
AID00137412	[FAILED] You're asking me to accept a bribe. I'd like to make sure the risk to my career - and freedom - benefits the families of my troops.
AID00137413	Way too much. Bring that price down and I'll consider it.
AID00137414	I'll be back with the caps.
AID00137415	All right.
AID00137416	Done. Here's the caps.
AID00137417	This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
AID00137418	Never mind. Forget I said anything.
AID00137419	Right.
AID00137420	Yes or no, that's all I want to hear.
AID00137421	Look at it this way - nobody dies.
AID00137422	500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
AID00137423	How much money would it take for you to look the other way while the Great Khans left?
AID00137424	You mean... just let them go? How would I explain this to my superiors?
AID00137425	I've been thinking about it since you brought it up earlier. 500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
AID00137426	< Speech - 45 >
AID00137427	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe I'm doing this, but all right, the hostages can go. The NCR had better keep their end of the deal, though.
AID00137428	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AID00137429	Free the hostages now, and I'll have the NCR escort you out of their territory.
AID00137430	[FAILED] Right, and they'd probably give us all medals, too. Maybe I should kill a hostage because you wasted my time with this shit.
AID00137431	If you let the hostages free now, maybe the NCR would just let you go.
AID00137432	I'm willing to hear other suggestions.
AID00137433	We'd try to bribe our way out, but seeing as how Benny didn't pay us yet, that won't happen.
AID00137434	Any chance you're willing to surrender?
AID00137435	And face NCR "justice?" No thanks. I'd rather not spend the next ten years doing hard labor.
AID00137436	Goodbye.
AID00137437	Goodbye
AID00137438	I'll try to remember that.
AID00137439	See that you do.
AID00137440	WranglerResponses
AID00137441	Where else?
AID00137442	Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
AID00137443	Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
AID00137444	What about Gloria?
AID00137445	Glory? Glory's fucking crazy.
AID00137446	Some of my siblings are real pieces of work, but I'd bet on Glory if she were facing down a deathclaw with a plastic spoon.
AID00137447	She's got the smarts to do whatever she wants, but she and momma are always butting heads, so she gets all the shit jobs.
AID00137448	I had other questions.
AID00137449	Make it quick. I got shit to do.
AID00137450	What about you?
AID00137451	I'm not one for running a business. Never really had a head for numbers or smooth-talk. My talents are a little more... direct.
AID00137452	Mama always said that was my gift. When we were kids, the others used to fight over and steal one another's toys. I always broke mine.
AID00137453	And if any of the others messed with me, I broke theirs too. Sometimes I'd break them even if they were nice to me, just to show them what's what.
AID00137454	One day mama took me aside and said, "Boy, you're never going to go very far, but you're going to make a whole lotta people come up short."
AID00137455	C'mon, girl. Let's get going.
AID00137456	Betsy, I need to go on by myself. Are you going to be okay, girl?
AID00137457	Why don't you just shoot your way out of here?
AID00137458	I'm not afraid of a gunfight, but I'd rather get back to Red Rock without a few extra holes in me if I can help it.
AID00137459	Why did Antony take him away?
AID00137460	Antony said he was punishing me for trying to hide it from the Legion.
AID00137461	How did you end up joining the Legion?
AID00137462	When the Legion showed up, we fought, most tribes did. Hangdogs hung out longer than most... broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
AID00137463	So we gave up, our elders couldn't bear the idea of our spirit animals burning in the afterlife.
AID00137464	Still, Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
AID00137465	Tell me about yourself.
AID00137466	I've been around dogs all my life. They're my life, always were - all the way back when I was a tribal, one of the Hangdogs, outside Denver.
AID00137467	Dogs roamed that city. Our tribe made peace with them. Thought they were our spirit animals - helped us hunt, provided for us in some lean times.
AID00137468	Then the Legion came. Good thing, too. Stronger now, don't need those beliefs anymore.
AID00137469	Do you have a problem with women?
AID00137470	Women are beneath notice, as Caesar has taught us. I'm only allowing you to speak to me because you are Caesar's guest.
AID00137471	I may yet, if Caesar commands it.
AID00137472	Who's in charge of the prison now?
AID00137473	That'll be Eddie. You can usually find him sitting in the warden's old chair up in the main building.
AID00137474	Not sure who's gonna take over with Eddie dead.
AID00137475	What exactly is a Powder Ganger?
AID00137476	That's us. We got sent here to fix the rails and make some new ones, and for that we got to use dynamite.
AID00137477	Of course, dynamite works pretty good against caravan guards, too. So, that's what we do - rob and blow things up.
AID00137478	If you're free, why are you sticking around?
AID00137479	We've got the biggest, baddest fort in the wasteland. There's water and power, and if we need grub, we just go out and steal it.
AID00137480	What did you do to end up in here?
AID00137481	Me? I ran with the toughest gang in the Hub. You've heard of the Hub, right? It's, uh, west of here, I think, back in California.
AID00137482	Never mind.
AID00137483	Quit wasting my time.
AID00137484	Here's the caps.
AID00137485	All right, you can go on in. Can't guarantee your safety, though. Just saying.
AID00137486	Can I go in?
AID00137487	Well, I don't know. Depends on if you can make it worth my time. A hundred caps sounds right to me.
AID00137488	Yeah, all right. Figure you could help us out the way you helped out Cobb's crew over in Goodsprings.
AID00137489	What is this place?
AID00137490	This? This is - or was - the big house. The New California Republic Correctional Facility. Not much "correcting" went on here, just slave labor.
AID00137491	One day, us prisoners decided to liberate ourselves. Killed the warden, killed the guards, took over the whole damn territory.
AID00137492	Goodbye.
AID00137493	Yup.
AID00137494	Only all the time.
AID00137495	You and me at Gomorrah, rolled up in those silk sheets. I got leave coming up in a bit, so let me know if you'll be around.
AID00137496	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
AID00137497	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
AID00137498	If this is a trap, I'm going to take a lot of you with me.
AID00137499	The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
AID00137500	You said Caesar has an offer for me. What kind of offer?
AID00137501	Caesar chose not to give me that information. I was only told to find you and bring you the message.
AID00137502	Goodbye.
AID00137503	Vale.
AID00137504	What are the Frumentarii?
AID00137505	We are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
AID00137506	Who are you?
AID00137507	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
AID00137508	Goodbye.
AID00137509	Vale.
AID00137510	Goodbye.
AID00137511	Be seeing you around.
AID00137512	I need something repaired.
AID00137513	I'll grab my tools.
AID00137514	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00137515	Have a look.
AID00137516	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00137517	Is this change behind your loss of inspiration?
AID00137518	Do you know Doc Mitchell?
AID00137519	You mean, Mitch? It's been ages since I've heard the name. My sister and I used to call him "Mole-butt." Don't ask.
AID00137520	That was a long time ago, before we exchanged the warmth of our home for the thin air of the Wasteland.
AID00137521	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
AID00137522	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
AID00137523	I don't have enough for a room.
AID00137524	I don't have enough for a room.
AID00137525	Vault 21 hopes to service your needs in the future. Goodbye.
AID00137526	Goodbye.
AID00137527	I need a room.
AID00137528	Proceed to your accomodations. Please, enjoy your stay at Vault 21.
AID00137529	Goodbye.
AID00137530	Observe the rules, citizen.
AID00137531	What's a Securitron doing here?
AID00137532	Vault 21's previous manager is no longer capable of servicing your needs. Hotel arrangement functions are now purview of Mr. House.
AID00137533	I need a room.
AID00137534	Get my room keys, and pass by later. I've got something for you.
AID00137535	Get my room keys, and pass by later. I've got something for you.
AID00137536	Do you get a lot of business here?
AID00137537	You know Doc Mitchell?
AID00137538	You know Doc Mitchell?
AID00137539	You know Doc Mitchell?
AID00137540	Mitch!? You know "mole-butt?"
AID00137541	I hadn't thought about that name in a long time. I was just a child, and he had a big mole in his rear bumper.
AID00137542	You understand, kids and all that. Everyone knows about each other in a Vault, there's no other way. I hope mol... I mean Mitch, is doing well!
AID00137543	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
AID00137544	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
AID00137545	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
AID00137546	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
AID00137547	Carlitos, huh? Yeah, I do. Try the diner, but don't start any trouble, you hear?
AID00137548	Yeah, pass by my room and we'll catch up.
AID00137549	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
AID00137550	You're kicking me into gear, huh? I think I'll drive my chassis over to your pad. Wait for me down there, and don't forget the oil.
AID00137551	Oh mighty Fantoma, I hope one day I can fight for the forces of good by your side!
AID00137552	Yes! It has been a long time since La Fantoma had a good sidekick!
AID00137553	<Mock Surrender> Woah, no way I'm fighting with the mighty Red-Brick.
AID00137554	You better believe it. I'll knock your block off!
AID00137555	I have no money for your toll, surely you will let a fair traveller pass through your gate.
AID00137556	Very well traveller. You may pass.
AID00137557	I bet when you get bigger you'll be able to fly your own plane.
AID00137558	You bet I will, I'm almost old enough to fly in the VR sims. That'll be awesome!
AID00137559	I'm a vicious velociraptor. ROAR!
AID00137560	Ooo, you know a lot about dinosaurs.
AID00137561	You don't need toys, I bet you can get a fun game of Boomers and targets.
AID00137562	That is a neat idea. I'll be the spotter. I'll find someone to play the target.
AID00137563	That's right. I've battled giant mutated animals, crazed raiders, and braved many other dangers.
AID00137564	Wow, you sound awesome.
AID00137565	REPCONHQTour02b
AID00137566	TestTopic
AID00137567	
AID00137568	You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
AID00137569	I know you feel safe here, but I could crush your windpipe before anyone noticed.
AID00137570	With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
AID00137571	I bet I could beat you up.
AID00137572	You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
AID00137573	I know you feel safe here, but I could crush your windpipe before anyone noticed.
AID00137574	With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
AID00137575	I bet I could beat you up.
AID00137576	I'm planning on playing some games in the Casino.
AID00137577	Of course, after all you did for me, here are some chips for you. Play, have some fun.
AID00137578	You play some games, have some fun. You did right by us.
AID00137579	Real subtle. Here you go. Play some games. Have some fun.
AID00137580	I'd have given the money away.
AID00137581	...Really? Wow, it never occurred to me to actually give the money away. Do people really do things like that?
AID00137582	I'd have saved the money, so I could someday get the hell out of here.
AID00137583	Hmmm... you're a long-term thinker, man. I like that. You might be on to something there.
AID00137584	Probably a weapon, given how dangerous it is around here.
AID00137585	Yeah... that's a good idea... no sense making money and waiting for someone to just come and take it, right?
AID00137586	You look like an idiot.
AID00137587	Yeah, it does look pretty sweet, doesn't i- hey, screw you! Who asked you anyway? The crap I put up with...
AID00137588	It's not exactly what I would have bought for myself.
AID00137589	Oh yeah, what would you have gotten?
AID00137590	Yeah, it looks great.
AID00137591	Exactly what I was thinking. It's nice to have a little style, you know?
AID00137592	But you're probably here for more of my special commodity, and luckily for you, I haven't been idle since last we spoke.
AID00137593	However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 100 a tip, now. You game?
AID00137594	
AID00137595	Hey, listen, I'd love to sell you some more info, but you've tapped everything I've heard lately.
AID00137596	Come back in a few days. I'll put my ear to the ground and hopefully have heard a few more things by then.
AID00137597	What do ya say, want another tip?
AID00137598	I got more where that came from. Want another?
AID00137599	That one was pretty good, right? How about another?
AID00137600	I've heard here and there that the word "Hope" has recently become quite popular with the Squatters.
AID00137601	But that's all I've heard. If I knew more, I'd try to bilk you out of more caps. You interested in one of my other tips?
AID00137602	I'd like to talk about something else.
AID00137603	What kind of upgrades?
AID00137604	Tell me about the other attractions.
AID00137605	Well, let's see: the NCR has an embassy here, but why you'd want to go talk to a bunch of boring old politicians I surely don't know.
AID00137606	Oh, and the Vault 21 Hotel and Gift Shop has an adorable collection of old Vault-Tec memorabilia.
AID00137607	And I suppose if you like neon signs, you might check out Michael Angelo's sign shop.
AID00137608	Tell me about the casinos.
AID00137609	Well, of course there used to be a lot more of them, but these days there are three open to the public: The Tops, the Ultra-Luxe, and Gomorrah.
AID00137610	And the Lucky 38 of course, but we're not open to the public. You're a special case, sugar.
AID00137611	Tell me about the Three Families.
AID00137612	They're just new money, sugar. They might pretend they're sophisticated, but between you and me, they're not far off from tribals.
AID00137613	The Omertas especially are just awful brutes. The Chairmen and the White Glove Society at least pretend to have some culture.
AID00137614	I really don't want to think about that.
AID00137615	Then maybe you shouldn't pry into a lady's particulars, hmm?
AID00137616	So you're... a copy of a dead woman? What exactly do you do for Mr. House?
AID00137617	Mr. House has a lot of needs, sugar. I take care of all of them, and a lady doesn't kiss and tell.
AID00137618	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137619	Anything you like, sugar.
AID00137620	I didn't realize robots could have such strong feelings about people.
AID00137621	Sugar, I may be a robot on the outside, but on the inside, my neuro-computational matrix is an exact copy of Mr. House's favorite girl.
AID00137622	Sounds like you're pretty fond of him.
AID00137623	Well, of course I am, silly! Mr. House is just the smartest, most wonderful man there ever was!
AID00137624	Why, did you know he single-handedly reclaimed New Vegas from all those nasty tribes that used to live here?
AID00137625	Well, he single-handedly sent in his Securitrons to do it, but that counts in my book.
AID00137626	What's with the snowglobe collection?
AID00137627	Not many people know this, but Mr. House is one of the world's biggest collectors of antique snow globes!
AID00137628	If you happen to find any out in the Wasteland, you can bring them to me and I'll add them to his collection! You'll get a reward, of course.
AID00137629	In fact, one of Mr. House's favorites went missing when we moved the collection. If you have a look around the Lucky 38, you might even find it!
AID00137630	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take it and put it with the rest of the collection.
AID00137631	I've got a snowglobe for Mr. House's collection.
AID00137632	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take them and put them with the rest of the collection.
AID00137633	I've got some snowglobes for Mr. House's collection.
AID00137634	MarilynJaneAttack
AID00137635	Aw, sugar, why'd you have to go make Mr. House mad? Now we've got to get all messy shooting you to little bits.
AID00137636	What kind of robots are you?
AID00137637	Why I'm a RobCo PDQ-88b Mk I Securitron, you silly goose! We're the finest in personal or civil robotic security on the market!
AID00137638	How sweet of you to notice, sugar! I've been upgraded to the Mark II software, and it's peachy having these high-explosive weapons fully accessible!
AID00137639	You look different somehow. Did you cut your hair?
AID00137640	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
AID00137641	Oh, there's lots of things to tell, I'm sure. There's the Three Families, the casinos, the other attractions - what would you like to know?
AID00137642	What is this place?
AID00137643	This is the Lucky 38 Resort and Casino - or, it used to be. Mr. House has kept the place locked up tight for ages now, nobody comes in or out.
AID00137644	Can you tell me about Mr. House?
AID00137645	Why, sugar, he's the maximum utmost! If it weren't for Mr. House, we wouldn't have this fabulous wonderland of New Vegas, would we?
AID00137646	Why does Caesar want to see me?
AID00137647	Go to him, and you will understand.
AID00137648	How did you find me here?
AID00137649	I am one of Caesar's Frumentarii, an infiltrator, a spy. You were not difficult to track.
AID00137650	Do I need to remind you that the NCR hates me?
AID00137651	No cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of Securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
AID00137652	Sounds like I get to kill lots of Legionaries.
AID00137653	Indeed you will. Just bear in mind that's not the reason you're there.
AID00137654	What's the goal?
AID00137655	Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
AID00137656	The override will enable to control the entire dam's power output.
AID00137657	You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
AID00137658	You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
AID00137659	As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready perform this task?
AID00137660	Why do I need to be there? The NCR has an army.
AID00137661	Indeed they do - an army that'll be too distracted with killing Legionaries to notice the real reason you're there.
AID00137662	I'll take care of it.
AID00137663	I'll take care of it.
AID00137664	I'll take care of it.
AID00137665	You already have power. Why is this important?
AID00137666	This is not a good time to be dependent on energy from Hoover Dam. When the Legion attacks, the NCR may cut power altogether.
AID00137667	And I'll be needing a good deal more power than the NCR has allotted to the Strip.
AID00137668	Broadcasting encrypted VMQ-boosted command signals to hundreds of Securitrons eats up more power than you might expect.
AID00137669	Why didn't you restart the reactor earlier?
AID00137670	I needed the operating software on the Platinum Chip to bring it back online.
AID00137671	And to start the reactor itself requires a tremendous jolt of current. Very attention-getting.
AID00137672	The NCR has its hands full now, of course. I doubt they'll raise much of a fuss.
AID00137673	Goodbye.
AID00137674	Come back when your work at the substation is done.
AID00137675	What's this about a dormant reactor?
AID00137676	The strain of defending Las Vegas from annhilation exceeded my power systems' capacity. My primary reactor shut down.
AID00137677	For years, I played a miser with my emergency power supply. I began to run out of reserves around the time I woke the first batch of Securitrons.
AID00137678	Negotiating an allotment of power from Hoover Dam was crucial. That's what's powered the Strip for the past seven years.
AID00137679	I'll take care of it.
AID00137680	With this accomplished, all preparations will have been made. The battle for Hoover Dam will be upon us before long.
AID00137681	What more could I have done?
AID00137682	You could've succeeded!
AID00137683	<Use Speech to deny responsibility.>
AID00137684	[SUCCEEDED] They knew you were coming? They were better prepared than I anticipated, then. I won't underestimate them again.
AID00137685	Before that happens, I'd ask you to complete one final task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
AID00137686	I was set up. The Legion used me as a patsy.
AID00137687	[FAILED] Whatever your reasons, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
AID00137688	It... it wasn't Kimball, it was an imposter. It had to die!
AID00137689	I had my reasons.
AID00137690	Whatever those reasons may be, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
AID00137691	Okay, I'll do it.
AID00137692	I'll be on my way, then.
AID00137693	Fine, I'll do it.
AID00137694	No thanks.
AID00137695	Not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? If you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we wouldn't be in this position.
AID00137696	Let Kimball Visit. Whatever happens, happens.
AID00137697	I'll do it.
AID00137698	Don't attack unless there are clear signs that Kimball's visit is imminent. Cause enough chaos to cancel the visit, no more. Then return to me.
AID00137699	I'll be leaving, then.
AID00137700	Oh no, not so quick. I still have work for you.
AID00137701	What should I do in the meantime?
AID00137702	There nothing I can do to protect Kimball?
AID00137703	I can't use you. Had you shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we'd be in a different position.
AID00137704	Let's get back to business.
AID00137705	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
AID00137706	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00137707	Is there any possiblity of a diplomatic solution?
AID00137708	Any recommendations on how to complete the mission?
AID00137709	From time to time, the NCR has assaulted Brotherhood bunkers. In four of the six incidents I know of, the bunkers self-destructed.
AID00137710	I surmise it's standard practice for the Brotherhood to install a self-destruct system. It's consistent with their uncompromising nature.
AID00137711	You might use that against them. Or kill them another way, it's up to you. Return when it's done.
AID00137712	I'd like to ask some questions.
AID00137713	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
AID00137714	The Brotherhood is holed up in Hidden Valley.
AID00137715	You're absolutely right. You must've had run-ins with them. As have I...
AID00137716	Send your Securitrons into Gomorrah and kill off the Omertas' leaders.
AID00137717	Exactly how many civilians did you want to die in that crossfire?
AID00137718	Still, you raise a fair point. My Securitrons can handle this. When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, I'll be waiting for the Omertas.
AID00137719	Wait for them to make their move. Forewarned is forearmed.
AID00137720	I suppose you're right... When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, my Securitrons will be waiting for the Omertas. They won't accomplish much.
AID00137721	Nothing I can do. Trying to stop them would be a suicide mission.
AID00137722	Can't put the genie back in the bottle, is that it? Maybe you should've thought of that before you conspired to destroy my property.
AID00137723	That said, I'd know nothing of the Omertas' plot if you'd kept it secret. Perhaps I owe you my gratitude, after all...
AID00137724	The information you've provided will suffice. When the battle for Hoover Dam comes, I'll make sure my Securitrons are waiting for the Omertas.
AID00137725	It means I have to kill you.
AID00137726	<Speech to lie to Mr. House about RACKET involvement.>
AID00137727	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, I commend you for your initiative. What do you recommend for next steps?
AID00137728	I infiltrated the Omertas in order to gain their confidence.
AID00137729	[FAILED]And you assisted them? That's what you mean to say, isn't it?
AID00137730	Well, thing is... I, uh... they tried to involve me...
AID00137731	I kind of helped them perfect their plan...
AID00137732	I see. So where does that put us?
AID00137733	Never mind, I'll check into it.
AID00137734	When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, the Omertas are going to massacre everyone on the Strip.
AID00137735	And how do you know this?
AID00137736	I may know something about that...
AID00137737	You'll have to be more specific.
AID00137738	No thanks.
AID00137739	I much prefer working with robots...
AID00137740	I'll be on my way.
AID00137741	There's a job that needs doing here, and I'm assigning it to you.
AID00137742	Marvellous work ethic, bravo.
AID00137743	The Omertas had it coming.
AID00137744	An opinion you expressed with supreme subtlety and finesse. Moving on...
AID00137745	1250 caps it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
AID00137746	Not interested.
AID00137747	Were you aware that Benny hijacked one of your Securitrons and used it to infiltrate your network?
AID00137748	Benny set me up for an ambush.
AID00137749	He set me up for an ambush.
AID00137750	Does the NCR usually offer bounties on people?
AID00137751	If they've proven hard to kill, yes. Whatever it takes to get the job done, even if means hiring help from outside the military.
AID00137752	Tell me about First Recon.
AID00137753	We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
AID00137754	Some of my team aren't without their share of scars, though, like Betsy and Sterling.
AID00137755	We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
AID00137756	Goodbye.
AID00137757	Carry on.
AID00137758	I'm sure it doesn't.
AID00137759	D-d-damn right.
AID00137760	Fiends aren't enough of a challenge for you?
AID00137761	Nasty how?
AID00137762	Never mind.
AID00137763	We're at your service, if you need us. Until Driver Nephi is dead. Major's orders.
AID00137764	Major Dhatri said I should talk to you about taking down Driver Nephi.
AID00137765	Whatever you need, we'll make sure it gets done.
AID00137766	If you need help from my team, just give the word. Driver Nephi's earned himself a few bullets in the gut.
AID00137767	The NCR will welcome my help.
AID00137768	Precisely. You'll have no trouble joining the battle on their side, and they'll be too distracted to notice why you're really there.
AID00137769	Cachino was talking about big plans for the Family.
AID00137770	Really? That two-faced son of a bitch. I'm glad now that we kept him mostly out of the loop. Look, we could use your help with some things.
AID00137771	Especially with Cachino gone, we could use another pair of competent hands, and I think you can provide that.
AID00137772	You can't have the tapes, but I'll keep them to myself if you leave and never come back.
AID00137773	Fuck, I was getting tired of this place anyways. I can find girls to play with somewhere else.
AID00137774	Nevermind.
AID00137775	Then get the fuck out of my face.
AID00137776	Let's talk about something else.
AID00137777	I'm not sure I have anything I want to hear from you, but you can have your moment.
AID00137778	I heard you're Bitter-Root's father.
AID00137779	Adoptive father, yes. I was very proud when he made First Recon. I know that every time I send them out, I could be sending him to his death.
AID00137780	But, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else. At least this way I get one more chance to see him.
AID00137781	I was. I thought I'd accepted the fact that I could be the one ordering him to his death, but it's been more difficult than I thought.
AID00137782	Excuse me, but I'd rather not speak of this.
AID00137783	Goodbye.
AID00137784	Goodbye.
AID00137785	How would you put it?
AID00137786	Well, don't.
AID00137787	Goodbye.
AID00137788	Goodbye.
AID00137789	Goodbye.
AID00137790	Some trick without a nose.
AID00137791	Heh, I like you, friend. Have I mentioned that?
AID00137792	Goodbye.
AID00137793	What do you want from me?
AID00137794	Goodbye.
AID00137795	Goodbye.
AID00137796	See ya round, buckaroo.
AID00137797	Well, happy trails, then!
AID00137798	'Til our trails cross again, pardner.
AID00137799	You saying I owe you?
AID00137800	I wouldn't put it exactly like that, friend.
AID00137801	I can take care of myself.
AID00137802	Sure you can, friend, but everyone needs a hand from time to time. Maybe you'll return the favor one day.
AID00137803	How did you know I was in trouble?
AID00137804	Heck, I can smell trouble a mile away.
AID00137805	'We'? Who is 'we'?
AID00137806	Are you threatening me?
AID00137807	Heh, well of course not. We just wouldn't want anything to happen to you is all.
AID00137808	Are you following me?
AID00137809	I saved your life so I kinda feel responsible for you is all.
AID00137810	Does it mean anything?
AID00137811	Yeah. It means you don't get shot.
AID00137812	VMS29NCROfficerChastisesKing
AID00137813	Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
AID00137814	NCR citizens are dying in Freeside and the NCR wants you to stop it.
AID00137815	Well, Freeside citizens are also being attacked and I'd like you all to stop it, but I'm guessing that's not going to happen, is it?
AID00137816	This little show of force accomplishes nothing. So take your toy soldiers and go home. Show's over.
AID00137817	The NCR wants you to curb the violence in Freeside. Or else.
AID00137818	You know, it's that "or else" part that gets stuck in my craw. It just sounds a little too much like you're trying to tell us what to do.
AID00137819	And nobody tells the Kings what to do. So why don't you and all of your little friends get the hell out of here. Or else.
AID00137820	I'm here to deliver an ultimatum from the NCR. Cease hostilities against the NCR or perish.
AID00137821	An ultimatum? Do you even know who you're talking to? We're the Kings, and no King will ever accept an ultimatum.
AID00137822	Go back to your general or commodore or whatever-the-fuck and tell them to shove their ultimatum where the sun don't shine.
AID00137823	VMS29KingUltimatumStart
AID00137824	Maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on here. These stony face bastards haven't said a word other than to say they're here under orders.
AID00137825	Where was I supposed to meet Price, again?
AID00137826	Pawn shop in Westside called Miguel's. It's in outer Vegas, northwest of the Strip.
AID00137827	Blake is where, exactly?
AID00137828	The Crimson Caravan is up north past the Gun Runners. During the day Blake is usually in their main office.
AID00137829	Remind me where Isaac is.
AID00137830	The Gun Runners are almost straight north of here. A little east. Isaac has a house in their compound.
AID00137831	I'm going to pollute the ventilation system with the strinking corpse of an NCR private.
AID00137832	...but relief must follow unbearable suffering.
AID00137833	Holy Christ. Get- get away from me!
AID00137834	Now both the Fiends and the NCR know not to fuck with me.
AID00137835	Yeah, well, it looks like it might be too late for the Fiends. But we got the message loud and clear.
AID00137836	I made a promise to Private Morales.
AID00137837	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a woman possessed.
AID00137838	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a man possessed.
AID00137839	I just did what anybody else would've done.
AID00137840	Bullshit. What anybody else would've done is get their asses killed. You're leading some kind of charmed life.
AID00137841	We'll make sure Ranger Morales' body gets sent back home. You don't have to, you know, pick him up on your shoulder and haul him to California.
AID00137842	Even though I believe you would if you had to. You should go tell Private Morales the news. I know she'll be relieved.
AID00137843	VFreeformMcCarranCorpseGuardEnd
AID00137844	Oh my God, are you okay? You've gotta get to a medic. Doc Kemp can patch you up back at base.
AID00137845	How could you just sacrifice your body like that? You never even met him. If the NCR doesn't have a medal for this, they should make one up.
AID00137846	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, man? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
AID00137847	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, lady? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
AID00137848	Where does the concrete come from?
AID00137849	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west. The supply had stopped for awhile because of a Deathclaw problem.
AID00137850	I heard some badass wastelander killed the Deathclaws, and deliveries of limestone have been coming in again.
AID00137851	I don't think they've gotten the trains up and running yet, but most of the concrete plant workers have come back to town now. Good for business.
AID00137852	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west, but I hear some Deathclaws overran the quarry.
AID00137853	With no work to be had, all the workers around here have wandered off. I'm the only one left in town.
AID00137854	Goodbye.
AID00137855	Goodbye, thank you.
AID00137856	Never mind.
AID00137857	Okay.
AID00137858	I killed the Deathclaw Alpha Male and Mother at Quarry Junction.
AID00137859	Nice!
AID00137860	Boulder City stuff.
AID00137861	What about Boulder City?
AID00137862	Who's in charge of the Powder Gangers?
AID00137863	Right now, Eddie and his boys run the place. They've got the guns and the dynamite, so they call the shots.
AID00137864	Why are you still here?
AID00137865	I'm not quite sure the kind of greeting NCR troopers will give an escaped con like myself. Figure it's better to stay put for now.
AID00137866	Where can I find Cooke?
AID00137867	He went north with some of the other guys. Didn't say where, didn't say why. All I know is he's got some kind of score to settle with the NCR.
AID00137868	Who's Cooke?
AID00137869	Some kind of anti-NCR rebel. Some people just don't like being pushed around and told what to do.
AID00137870	Goodbye.
AID00137871	Watch yourself out there.
AID00137872	Tell me more about what happened in the prison.
AID00137873	I understand that Cooke was behind it all. I kept my head down the whole time. Didn't want any part of it.
AID00137874	I stuck around, figuring the NCR would show up and put things back the way they were. No sense in making myself look guilty, right?
AID00137875	What did you do before you ended up incarcerated?
AID00137876	I was a sheriff, believe it or not, for a small town far to the west of here.
AID00137877	The short version is that sometimes justice is a little slow, and I helped speed it up one too many times.
AID00137878	I'm not sorry for anything I did, but I will do the time. Fair enough trade, if you ask me.
AID00137879	How did you all manage to escape?
AID00137880	One night, there was a big explosion from the other cell block. I had no idea what was going on, so I took cover in my bunk.
AID00137881	When it was all over, the guards were dead and we were free. Most of the other prisoners scattered, but a few of us stuck around, obviously.
AID00137882	What's your reason for staying?
AID00137883	The location to the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
AID00137884	Me, I like having big walls between myself and the wasteland.
AID00137885	What did you do before?
AID00137886	Let's see... I've been a farmhand, a bouncer, a bandit, and an NCR trooper. I don't recommend any of them.
AID00137887	What did you do to end up in here?
AID00137888	Medical supplies go for a decent amount of caps in the right markets. I figured the quartermaster wouldn't notice any missing. I was wrong.
AID00137889	Why are you "sort of" the doctor?
AID00137890	I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training that any of the other guys here.
AID00137891	It also gives me an excuse to stay out of any raiding parties. The gang can't lose its only doctor now, can it?
AID00137892	I need a doctor.
AID00137893	The fact that you're still on your feet is... surprising.
AID00137894	Life can be pretty rough sometimes.
AID00137895	I've seen worse.
AID00137896	Goodbye.
AID00137897	Later.
AID00137898	Why do you stay here?
AID00137899	Don't have any other place to go. I'd just end up back in another prison, or dead out in the wasteland.
AID00137900	What can you tell me about this place?
AID00137901	This is where the NCR sent prisoners to "reform" through hard labor. I never saw much reforming around here, myself.
AID00137902	What did you do to end up here in the first place?
AID00137903	I worked in a casino in New Reno, and one of the pit bosses decided he didn't like me. Framed me over some caps, and I ended up in here.
AID00137904	You're a trader?
AID00137905	I was always the guy who could get things, if you know what I mean. Figured I might as well keep on doing it.
AID00137906	Goodbye.
AID00137907	See you.
AID00137908	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00137909	If I don't have anything you like, well... tough. I don't do special orders.
AID00137910	You got it.
AID00137911	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
AID00137912	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
AID00137913	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
AID00137914	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
AID00137915	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
AID00137916	Hell, it's all dangerous. Know why? Because you can't trust anything that stands on two legs.
AID00137917	If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
AID00137918	If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
AID00137919	Goodbye.
AID00137920	Goodbye.
AID00137921	Is there any work to do here?
AID00137922	I've got proof of what I've said.
AID00137923	Goodbye.
AID00137924	Yeah, that's right - good to say bye to you.
AID00137925	What do you know about Cooke?
AID00137926	One mean son of a bitch. Really, truly hates the NCR for some reason, and he got a lot of the other guys around to his way of thinking.
AID00137927	Where is Cooke now?
AID00137928	He and his crew went north. I heard talk about some sort of "big plan" to get back at the NCR, but haven't seen them since.
AID00137929	What can you tell me about the prison?
AID00137930	The NCR called it a "work-release" prison. We lucky prisoners got the privilege of fixing up the rail lines and blasting rock for new lines.
AID00137931	They got sloppy, though. Some of us managed to hide away some dynamite, and look who's in charge now.
AID00137932	How did the breakout happen?
AID00137933	It was all Cooke's idea. He and his boys managed to swipe some dynamite and hide it away in their cells.
AID00137934	The rest of us just tagged along. Cooke's crew headed north while the rest of us stuck around for payback.
AID00137935	How did you end up in this place?
AID00137936	Why do you care? Answer: you shouldn't. I don't feel like trading life stories.
AID00137937	What am I looking for in Primm?
AID00137938	I know the NCR has troops near Primm, so talk to the locals and find out if any of those troops are going to be coming our way.
AID00137939	I got rid of him.
AID00137940	Good. Had him figured for NCR, one of the rangers maybe. Anyway, speaking of the NCR, I need you to take a walk down to Primm.
AID00137941	The NCR hasn't raised hell over our breakout, and I want to find out why. They're up to something, I can feel it.
AID00137942	What exactly is "funny" about that merchant you want me to check out?
AID00137943	Most people already know we run this territory, and are usually in a hurry to get out. Not this guy. It's like he wants us to come get him.
AID00137944	Not "ha ha" funny, you moron. Funny as in suspicious. He's not trying to run away like most people.
AID00137945	Chavez has been dealt with. You won't see him around here anymore.
AID00137946	I'm happy you cleaned that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
AID00137947	Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if he's not, take him out.
AID00137948	What do you need done?
AID00137949	This is Powder Ganger territory - my territory. Most of the guys around here understand that. One, Chavez, doesn't.
AID00137950	Chavez formed his own crew and have been hitting traders on their own. Everybody I've sent after him either got killed or weren't able to catch him.
AID00137951	That leaves you. What do you say?
AID00137952	Nothing's changed. Chavez won't answer to me, but he and his crew operate in my territory. Deal with him.
AID00137953	No.
AID00137954	Inform me when you are ready to go.
AID00137955	Yes.
AID00137956	Let's proceed.
AID00137957	VMS29KingAndPacerArgue
AID00137958	This is bullshit! Why are we even talking about dealing with these guys?
AID00137959	Pace, this isn't really a good time to have this discussion...
AID00137960	Wrong. This is exactly the right time. I'm about to prevent you from making a huge mistake.
AID00137961	Pace, don't do this. I won't stand with you if you do.
AID00137962	Then I'll stand on my own, just like I always have. Just like a King should.
AID00137963	Don't take that tone with me. These soldiers would wipe the floor with your men.
AID00137964	Sounds like a challenge. Boys, let's do this!
AID00137965	I apologize for their rudeness. The NCR wants peace in Freeside, and offers additional supplies.
AID00137966	And I suppose they want me to help see that happen? That seems pretty reasonable.
AID00137967	I've been instructed to offer you more resources in exchange for your word that the violence stops.
AID00137968	That sounds fair. And all I have to do is try to tone down the attacks on the Squatters, you say?
AID00137969	VMS29KingOfferStart
AID00137970	Okay, I need some answers, now. These guys just barged in here and said they were under orders to keep me here until you arrived.
AID00137971	I'm about five seconds away from telling my men to take them down, so speak fast.
AID00137972	The ambassador didn't think Colonel Moore would handle the situation correctly.
AID00137973	Moore's got her hands full right now, and she's not a subtle person in the best of times. Her solution would be quick and dirty.
AID00137974	I agree with Crocker that a more peaceful solution is preferable, especially for the long term.
AID00137975	He said you might have a better way of dealing with the issue.
AID00137976	Well, I do get to make the calls on the distribution of supplies there.
AID00137977	Crocker was probably counting on me being able to offer the Kings a carrot. And that's what I'm inclined to do.
AID00137978	He said those were his official orders, but suggested seeing you anyway.
AID00137979	Because he's looking to avoid a bloodbath. I get it. He knows me.
AID00137980	All right. Moore's not gonna like it. But that's for Crocker to worry about.
AID00137981	Go to the leader of the Kings and tell him that I'll make sure Freeside gets more water, power, and food as long as the violence there stops.
AID00137982	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about the situation with the Kings in Freeside.
AID00137983	Ah, that. I'm surprised he didn't send you to Colonel Moore. That'd be her jurisdiction.
AID00137984	I've already received a communique from Colonel Moore saying that she's sent a squad down to Freeside.
AID00137985	If you'd come to me first, I might have been able to do something. But at this point, my hands are tied. Sorry.
AID00137986	Let's take our chances. <Untie Benny.>
AID00137987	Let's take our chances. <Untie Benny.>
AID00137988	Blow on the dice, baby. We're gonna need luck to get outta here alive.
AID00137989	You invited me and promised safe-conduct.
AID00137990	No, I came to decorate this tent with your guts.
AID00137991	VDialogueMrHouseSecuritronUpgrade
AID00137992	Step closer to the demonstration area, if you would...
AID00137993	I expect you're well familiar with my Securitrons by now.
AID00137994	The titanium alloy housing that protects its electronic core deflects small arms and shrapnel easily enough...
AID00137995	Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly  against soft targets at medium range...
AID00137996	And for close-range suppression or crowd control, the Securitron is armed with a 9mm submachinegun.
AID00137997	All of this, you probably already knew...
AID00137998	What you did not know is that these are the Securitrons' secondary weapons.
AID00137999	All this time, my Securitrons have had to get by running the Mark I operating system, which lacked software drivers for their primary weapons!
AID00138000	Today, with the delivery of the Platinum Chip, all that changes. Behold, for the first time, Securitrons running the Mark II OS!
AID00138001	The M-235 Missile Launcher gives the Securitron the ability to engage ground and air targets at significantly longer ranges...
AID00138002	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system ensures the Securitron is deadly in close-range engagements.
AID00138003	The software upgrade also includes drivers for the Securitrons' highly sophisticated onboard auto-repair systems.
AID00138004	All together, the Mark II software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness per unit.
AID00138005	The city of New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
AID00138006	Return to the penthouse now. We have much to discuss...
AID00138007	vDialogueMrHouseLastWillTestament
AID00138008	If this statement is being broadcast, I am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
AID00138009	I, Robert Edwin House, am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
AID00138010	I should be going.
AID00138011	<Lie> Sure, what about the place?
AID00138012	Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
AID00138013	More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
AID00138014	I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
AID00138015	<Lie> No, I haven't.
AID00138016	It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
AID00138017	I have a better idea. Why don't I just take all my caps back from your corpse?
AID00138018	You're welcome to try.
AID00138019	I'm not giving you my caps.
AID00138020	Then you give me no choice.
AID00138021	Why are you doing this?
AID00138022	Man, I'm tired of scrounging for caps from ungrateful idiots like you. It's past time I moved on to bigger and better things.
AID00138023	Now are you going to hand over your caps, or am I going to shoot you and take them anyway?
AID00138024	Don't shoot! Here you go.
AID00138025	Wow, I didn't think it would be this easy. I should have done this years ago. Guess I'll be going then.
AID00138026	Oh, here's a final tip - don't ever follow anyone into a dark alley in Freeside. Later, chump.
AID00138027	No right now. I'm busy.
AID00138028	Well, don't wait too long. What I've got is something you'd need to act on, quick.
AID00138029	Sure. What is it?
AID00138030	I don't want to mention it out in plain sight like this. You never know who might be listening. Follow me.
AID00138031	I don't care. Do you have any new info?
AID00138032	Yeesh, you're just all business, aren't you? Well, I like how I look, and that's what's important. Though it'd be nice if other people did too.
AID00138033	As good as a ghoul in a suit can look.
AID00138034	Fuck you, human. We don't all share your wonderful complexion. Some of us have to make do, you know?
AID00138035	Anyway, I was just going to tell you that I've come across some new tidbits you might find interesting.
AID00138036	And since you're just about my favorite person in the world, each one is only going to cost you 100 caps. Interested?
AID00138037	Very classy.
AID00138038	You said it. With these threads, people are finally going to start noticing me.
AID00138039	I've already forgotten it.
AID00138040	Yeah, I bet you have. Not important enough for you to remember, huh?
AID00138041	I'm sorry. I was out of line before.
AID00138042	It's cool. I'm just a little touchy about people making fun of me, especially smoothskins. But you're not all bad. Take the Followers, for example.
AID00138043	Why, just the other week, one of them offered me a job. Can you imagine? Me, with a real job?
AID00138044	Can you imagine? Me? With a real job?
AID00138045	I'm sorry. Sorry you're such a prissy asshole.
AID00138046	You're a real piece of work, you know that?
AID00138047	Sure, but what about this place? Isn't it your home?
AID00138048	This place is a shithole, but yeah, it's home. I've lived here all my life. I'd be leaving a piece of myself behind if I left.
AID00138049	There'd be things I'd miss - the fun of watching the Kings kick the crap out of a thief, or the look of joy on a child's face after catching a rat.
AID00138050	Ah, now you've got me all nostalgic-like. Maybe I'd be better off trying to find a way to make this place better than giving up and leaving.
AID00138051	You wouldn't last ten seconds out in the waste.
AID00138052	That's a hell of a thing to say. Build up a man's hopes, then dash them in front of him.
AID00138053	And who says I couldn't survive just as well as you out there? People are always underestimating me, damn.
AID00138054	I go places all the time. It's actually pretty easy to just pick up and leave.
AID00138055	That's true, you seem to always be on the move and it seems to be working out for you pretty well.
AID00138056	I've already got a decent amount saved up. If I keep it up, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to go start over somewhere else soon.
AID00138057	You believed that crap I said about giving the money away?
AID00138058	What? N-No, I knew you were just kidding. Ha ha. You're a funny one, all right.
AID00138059	Freeside's problems are too big for you to have much impact.
AID00138060	You're probably right. This place has been going downhill for a long time. Maybe I could start over somewhere else.
AID00138061	Just think of it. A new life...
AID00138062	Oh yeah, I heard some new things that you might find interesting. I'm going to have to start charging 100 caps per tip, though.
AID00138063	After all, I have to save up for my ticket out of here, right?  So how about it? Want a tip?
AID00138064	No, you could make a real difference.
AID00138065	You really think so, pal? I'll start looking into it. I bet I can help a lot of people around here.
AID00138066	Now you'll get some respect. You should give some hell to the people that used to push you around.
AID00138067	Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. They'll learn that shouldn't have messed with me. Just wait till they get what's coming to them!
AID00138068	Good for you. No one should have to be afraid all the time.
AID00138069	Unfortunately, it comes with the territory around here. But being afraid sucks, no doubt about it.
AID00138070	Oh, hey, I almost forgot to tell you I heard a few things you might be interested in.
AID00138071	I'm kind of sorry about this, but I'm going to have to up my price to 100 caps per tip from now on.
AID00138072	It's getting tougher to discover new things that might interest a traveler such as yourself. I'm sure you understand. So, you interested or what?
AID00138073	Whoa, now. Watch where you point that thing. It's dangerous.
AID00138074	Dangerous... I like that. Maybe it's time people starting being afraid of me rather than the other way around.
AID00138075	Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you that I got some new info for you. Each tip's gonna cost 100 caps now though.
AID00138076	Cause I got plans. Big plans. So what do you say? Want a tip?
AID00138077	I want to ask you general questions.
AID00138078	Let me ask you more about you and Vault 21.
AID00138079	Mr. House won't give you any more trouble. I took care of that.
AID00138080	Do you mean that he's a goner? I can have my Vault back?
AID00138081	That's just super! I thought we'd never see a different New Vegas, one that belongs to the people.
AID00138082	But not to me. I'll sever your head and carry it with me always - a message to would-be traitors.
AID00138083	No! Stay away from me!
AID00138084	Very well. I'll try and help you.
AID00138085	I knew you'd be reasonable. Now... how did you find me? Did the officer send you?
AID00138086	[Attack] Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
AID00138087	Then he's a fool!
AID00138088	I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
AID00138089	What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
AID00138090	So you want me to do what you can't.
AID00138091	I think if you rough him up enough and really put some fear into him, he'll sing like a choir boy.
AID00138092	So let's do this. When you're ready, I'll go in and give you a little intro. Then I leave the room and you make him regret the day he was born.
AID00138093	We go back and forth a couple of times until either he talks or he can't move his jaw anymore. Either way we've had our entertainment for the day.
AID00138094	What do you think it means?
AID00138095	Well, I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like a man who's willing to cooperate. Except he hasn't.
AID00138096	Only times he speaks up are to insult you. He's a real prick, by the way. And I'm supposed to get information out of this guy.
AID00138097	Is that a big deal?
AID00138098	Better believe it. Everybody, everybody in Caesar's Legion from Caesar on down will kill themselves before they can be captured.
AID00138099	They're so twitchy they'd probably do it if you reached out to hug them.
AID00138100	But here's this guy who's an elite commander in their army and he just gives himself up, even as his men are slitting their own throats around him.
AID00138101	Would you be willing to give me the control tower access key so I can check it out?
AID00138102	Sure, if you want to investigate. It's not like there's anything to steal up there. Just a bunch of old communications equipment.
AID00138103	If you can find out any more, I'd be interested to hear it.
AID00138104	There's something about this I really don't like, and if I weren't tied up here I'd be staking it out personally.
AID00138105	Anyone else missing?
AID00138106	Yeah. The man I'm more interested in is Corporal White.
AID00138107	White had a lot of promise. Wanted to be a ranger as bad as anyone I've seen. But he also had some extracurricular activities going. Now he's gone.
AID00138108	<Continue Listening>
AID00138109	I haven't breathed a word about the officer we planted here - he continues to radio intelligence to Caesar's camp nearly every night.
AID00138110	I've proven my loyalty. All you're doing is killing a loyal soldier. If that's Caesar's policy, then I say his empire will crumble.
AID00138111	<Continue Listening>
AID00138112	Time was essential for my mission, but we waited three days for him to dispatch us. Another of his headaches. Does that sound like a man in command?
AID00138113	He has an operative planted in this very base, but does he use his agent to rescue me? No.
AID00138114	He's content to have the agent spend his nights radioing troop positions back to our base camp. He knows I'm here, and he's left me to rot.
AID00138115	Let's discuss something else.
AID00138116	Okay.
AID00138117	So where do I find his footlocker?
AID00138118	His footlocker is in the barracks in the main concourse.
AID00138119	Is that everything?
AID00138120	Report him to Colonel Hsu. Do all that and we should be free and clear.
AID00138121	Oh, and Crenshaw should be dead before you report him. Don't leave any chance for him to deny the bombings. Let's say he pulled a gun on you.
AID00138122	I've got him on guard duty patrolling the tarmac just inside the south gate. And I reassigned the other guard, so he should be alone.
AID00138123	What do I do when I'm at the train?
AID00138124	Put the bomb in one of the vents inside the train on the back wall, towards the joint that connects the cars.  Arm it, and get out of there.
AID00138125	I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of a Private Crenshaw.
AID00138126	Crenshaw's a problem child. Lots of run-ins with his superiors. It'll be easy for them to believe he's working for the Legion.
AID00138127	Where should I start?
AID00138128	You want my advice, start by talking to people with a lot of eyes in the field. People like Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant Contreras, maybe.
AID00138129	Careful with Contreras, though. He's not above suspicion himself.
AID00138130	Keep me apprised of any leads you get. This guy's gotten a lot of my men killed. I'm just itching to return the favor.
AID00138131	So what's the plan?
AID00138132	All right, forget about blaming Crenshaw. Just bomb the monorail.
AID00138133	Without a fall guy, it's dangerous for us to be seen together. We shouldn't speak again.
AID00138134	If you believe in the Legion's cause, your mission is a reward in and of itself. Good luck.
AID00138135	Where does that leave you?
AID00138136	Now we're trying to secure the Strip and the Dam at the same time, and it's costing us.
AID00138137	And in the meantime General Oliver won't approve any offensive maneuvers because he doesn't want to risk losing our positions.
AID00138138	So we're in a holding pattern here. And Caesar's on the other side of the river, planning.
AID00138139	Any other problems?
AID00138140	Yeah. On top of everything else, I can't send a patrol on a bathroom break without it being ambushed by someone who heard they were coming.
AID00138141	So somebody's getting the word out.
AID00138142	What challenges does the NCR face here?
AID00138143	Everything was going according to President Kimball's plan at first. We met minor resistance from local troublemakers.
AID00138144	But our two main objectives are still contested. Mr. House controls the Strip and he won't so much as meet with our ambassador.
AID00138145	And we're holding Hoover Dam, but Caesar's Legion is positioning itself to overrun it. If it falls, so will New Vegas. We'd be forced to withdraw.
AID00138146	Are things mostly quiet between here and the Dam?
AID00138147	Unfortunately, no. In fact, the word from the Ranger stations has been especially concerning lately.
AID00138148	It sounds like they've run into overwhelming resistance, and supplies just aren't reaching them.
AID00138149	It's been so bad I asked Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope to look into it and see how it is that things could be so fouled up there.
AID00138150	What's Camp McCarran's role in NCR operations?
AID00138151	It's our main base. We took it because it lets us keep an eye on the Strip. And it had already been fortified before the Great War.
AID00138152	From here we handle most of the logistics for our operations in Nevada. Troop allocation, supply distribution, intel.
AID00138153	Usually General Oliver runs the show here, but he's on his way to the Dam now, so I've taken on a lot of his duties here.
AID00138154	Seen anything suspicious lately?
AID00138155	You mean other than some stranger with no military ID interrogating me inside our base?
AID00138156	Did Boyd put you up to this? I am so sick of this harassment. You tell her to stop wasting my time with this bullshit.
AID00138157	No. I haven't seen anything suspicious. It's been business as usual.
AID00138158	I heard a rumor that there's something between you and the Van Graffs. What happened?
AID00138159	Pfff, that's old news. I had some fun with that girl that runs their operation, and then I got tired of her. So I moved on.
AID00138160	She don't like that, see? Normally, I bet she'd just have a guy killed for doing that, but as you can see, I'm still around.
AID00138161	Most people think it's cause she doesn't want to start an all-out war with us, but that ain't it at all. She's still got it bad for me.
AID00138162	Don't the Kings run this place, though?
AID00138163	We do what we want, just like everybody else. We just have more guys, so other people tend to do what we want, too.
AID00138164	If somebody does something we don't like, we let them know about it. If they're strong enough not to care about us liking it, good for them.
AID00138165	What about crime?
AID00138166	What about it? Someone takes your stuff, you're free to take it back. If you can't, maybe you shouldn't have come to Freeside in the first place.
AID00138167	I'm trying to get to the Strip. Know anything that could help me out?
AID00138168	You're looking to get past those tin cans at the gate, right? They let people by all the time, if they've got the caps.
AID00138169	But if you're not rich, and I can tell you ain't, the King might be able to help you out, provided he likes you.
AID00138170	How did you join the Kings?
AID00138171	I didn't join the Kings. I helped start the Kings. This whole operation you see here was put together by the King and yours truly.
AID00138172	What can you tell me about the Kings?
AID00138173	Not much to tell. We're a bunch of guys that just want to do our own thing, and anyone who's got a problem with that can shove it.
AID00138174	Tell me about Freeside.
AID00138175	It ain't much to look at, but this dump has something that even the Strip doesn't, and that's absolute freedom.
AID00138176	You go other places, and there's always someone screaming at you to act a certain way, or to not do certain things.
AID00138177	Freeside's not like that. Everyone here is free to do whatever they want, and I for one wouldn't want it any other way.
AID00138178	I'm looking to score some Med-X. Can you help?
AID00138179	Goodbye.
AID00138180	You know where to find me.
AID00138181	I hear you spend most of your caps on Sweetie.
AID00138182	That's private. I don't go asking about how you like to get laid, and I don't wanna know. Enough of that.
AID00138183	Tell me about Dermot, your partner.
AID00138184	What do you even mean? He's Dermot.
AID00138185	Dermot knows how to work salvage than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
AID00138186	I found this teddy bear in your partner's room. Strange, don't you think?
AID00138187	I know what you and your partner have been up to - I got the evidence from your rooms.
AID00138188	You're right about that.  Saint James! Got a thief here!
AID00138189	I hear you and your partner are coyotes.
AID00138190	Don't believe everything you hear. Me and Saint James earn our caps working salvage.
AID00138191	It's hard work, so when I'm not working I like to relax. Which means it's time for you to fuck off.
AID00138192	Like I told you, we work salvage. We aren't coyotes. And like I told you, fuck off.
AID00138193	Why is your partner called Saint James?
AID00138194	Because it's his name. He may be high-strung, but he's all right. Hauls his half of scrap, which is all I need.
AID00138195	What do you do around here?
AID00138196	Me and my partner Saint James work salvage around Westside, that's all.
AID00138197	Goodbye.
AID00138198	See you.
AID00138199	<200 caps needed> I'm kind of short on caps right now.
AID00138200	No freebies, Sugar. Not even for you.
AID00138201	Not interested.
AID00138202	You can play hard-to-get. I understand. I know the game.
AID00138203	Oh honey, I know you're interested. I just don't go that way is all.
AID00138204	<200 caps> Let's do it.
AID00138205	Oh, we will, sugar. We will.
AID00138206	I'll do my best to live up to my last performance.
AID00138207	How much for your services?
AID00138208	A pittance, sugar - and I'll leave you without a care in the world.
AID00138209	Sorry, ma'am, but ain't enough caps in all of New Vegas to make me do that. Nuh-uh.
AID00138210	Same price as before, sugar, and the same fun, too.
AID00138211	I told you, I ain't ever doing that again - ever. It was like being a slave all over again.
AID00138212	Tell me about Pretty Sarah.
AID00138213	She's an honest woman. Splits the earnings fair, and keeps Sweetie and Maude in line.
AID00138214	Minds her own business, too. She knows what it's like for people to go through things they'd rather not talk about.
AID00138215	That's quite a story, Jimmy.
AID00138216	Yeah, I lived through it. I like it here better.
AID00138217	Sounds like life in the Legion is tough.
AID00138218	It's tough on both sides of the fence, really. I think women have it worse. They're like money, given as rewards. Breeding stock.
AID00138219	Honestly, as long as men meet obligations and the child count, "friendships" are a sight more equal than the level of most Legion husbands and wives.
AID00138220	I hear you were a slave of Caesar's Legion.
AID00138221	What Marco said is true. The Legion attacked my village when I was 16.
AID00138222	My parents were killed as examples. The rest of us, chained and dragged to some kind of camp. A Centurion there chose me as his tent servant.
AID00138223	He was handsome, and gentle, most of the time. Said it was our secret, and he'd protect me. Gave me little gifts, stupid things.
AID00138224	But Caesar punishes homosexuality with death, and we nearly got caught, and there were suspicions. So when he took me out into the desert...
AID00138225	Well, I knew he was going to get rid of me. So I kicked him where it counts and I ran. And then swam. And ran some more. Wound up here.
AID00138226	Baby, who I am doesn't matter. I'll be anybody you need me to be. It's better that way, you'll see.
AID00138227	I'm just a fantasy come to life. But you already knew that.
AID00138228	Been working here long?
AID00138229	Half a year or so. The Casa's a dump and Marco's a pig, but Pretty Sarah makes sure I don't get hassled.
AID00138230	I don't get as many customers as Sweetie or Maude. But the customers I do get always come back.
AID00138231	I found this teddy bear in Saint James's room.
AID00138232	Do you know Saint James?
AID00138233	Sure do. Saint James is my number one customer. He's a prospector who pays Marco to stay here at the Casa week to week.
AID00138234	I don't know why his friend Dermot chose to stay here - he's never been with me or nobody else. But Saint James likes having me close at hand.
AID00138235	No thanks.
AID00138236	Fine by me. You the one missing out on exciting details.
AID00138237	I don't have 200 caps.
AID00138238	Then I guess there's no need for us to keep talking, honey. Sorry.
AID00138239	All right. 200 caps it is.
AID00138240	Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
AID00138241	Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
AID00138242	Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
AID00138243	All right. 200 caps it is.
AID00138244	< Barter 30 >
AID00138245	[SUCCEEDED] Funny how I make caps every time I open my mouth.
AID00138246	Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
AID00138247	Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
AID00138248	Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
AID00138249	Let's say 100 caps. Or you could earn zero keeping your mouth shut.
AID00138250	[FAILED] I'll leave it. You can leave, too.
AID00138251	100 caps. Take it or leave it.
AID00138252	Does Saint James pay you for anything "unusual"?
AID00138253	A client's got a right to privacy. So it'll cost 200 caps for me to tell you all about it.
AID00138254	Like I said - 200 caps to hear all about it.
AID00138255	Never mind.
AID00138256	Keep telling yourself that, sugar. You'll be back.
AID00138257	<300 caps needed> I don't have enough on me right now...
AID00138258	Then I guess you won't be getting on me, either. Improve your prospects and come back, sugar. I'll be waiting.
AID00138259	Goodbye.
AID00138260	You know you'll be back.
AID00138261	<300 caps> Here's your money.
AID00138262	Get ready, honey. I'm going to make it good for you.
AID00138263	Let me help you slip into something a little more comfortable.
AID00138264	I am going to make your toes curl, baby.
AID00138265	So get on the bed already. I got something to show you.
AID00138266	How much does it cost to hire you?
AID00138267	It's worth every cap, baby. I'll do things to you you didn't think was possible, and leave you feeling like everything's right in the world.
AID00138268	I'm not surprised. Whip out your caps and away we go.
AID00138269	Same price as before, baby, and worth every little cap.
AID00138270	Wouldn't you make more money working on the Strip?
AID00138271	I got my start at the Gomorrah, good money, but I saw how those Omertas hook girls on free Jet or Med-X - then start charging.
AID00138272	Slavery through a needle is what that is. I earn less out here, but I keep more.
AID00138273	Tell me about yourself.
AID00138274	I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll find anywhere outside of the Strip. I could work in those casinos if I wanted.
AID00138275	You work for Pretty Sarah?
AID00138276	I bring in the customers, and she makes sure no one gets rough. Sarah's good people. Good enough, anyway.
AID00138277	Tell me about Pretty Sarah.
AID00138278	Ain't so pretty, is she? Not since she had a run-in with those Fiends over near McCarran.
AID00138279	This Fiend named Cook-Cook on account of the flamethrower he wears? He had his way with Sarah, every way it can be done.
AID00138280	Then he starts frying her up for kicks. Guess it was how he signed his work. 
AID00138281	Take a look at this ledger I found in Dermot's room.
AID00138282	I'll take a look, but you better have a good reason for asking me to violate his privacy.
AID00138283	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
AID00138284	I've seen enough. They're done for, both of them.
AID00138285	You might be interested to know that I killed a fiend named Cook-Cook.
AID00138286	You did? Well, that's one hell of a service to humanity, then.
AID00138287	I guess I always thought maybe I'd be the one to do it, but I just... never got my nerve up.
AID00138288	Maybe I'll sleep good tonight... Here, take this. It's how I say thanks.
AID00138289	How did you get burned so badly?
AID00138290	We don't talk about that. Next topic.
AID00138291	What do you do around here?
AID00138292	I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
AID00138293	All Marco does is collect rent and take a small cut of my action. He sure as hell doesn't clean the rooms.
AID00138294	I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
AID00138295	Now that Marco's no longer around, I guess it's up to me to collect rent, too.
AID00138296	I'm interested in learning more about Dermot and Saint James.
AID00138297	They don't look like much, but they earn a pretty good living by selling scrap and salvage.
AID00138298	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
AID00138299	Coyotes? Yeah, they run folks onto the Strip, have some kind of connections over there. Everybody makes a living one way or another.
AID00138300	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
AID00138301	Goodbye.
AID00138302	Catch you later, then.
AID00138303	Tell me about Sweetie.
AID00138304	Oh, I know everything - how she smells, how she tastes, how it feels to slip her on and wiggle.
AID00138305	Damn fine woman, but damn expensive, too. Just ask Saint James - he spends near every cap he gets on Sweetie's sweets.
AID00138306	What do you know about Jimmy?
AID00138307	Him? Caesar's Legion taught him everything he knows. I bet there's a pound of sand ground into his palms and knees!
AID00138308	Knowing Jimmy, I'm sure he took good care of them. I'm surprised he ran away!
AID00138309	Tell me about Dermot.
AID00138310	Roughneck prospector is all I hear, good at what he does. Been renting a room here for a year or so - nothing special.
AID00138311	What do you know about Dermot and Saint James?
AID00138312	Those boys been living here a while now. They sell salvage and do all right. I never been with either of them.
AID00138313	That Saint James is all over Sweetie every time he rustles up the caps to afford her. She says he's peculiar but who isn't?
AID00138314	What do you know about Jimmy?
AID00138315	I suppose he's okay, for one of those. I suppose Pretty Sarah's got to cover every sort of customer.
AID00138316	Is this apartment building yours?
AID00138317	Yep, for a few years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
AID00138318	Folks who can't pay their way onto the Strip need a place to stay, too. And when Pretty Sarah set her whores up here, the Casa went full-service.
AID00138319	No thanks.
AID00138320	I'll be right here if you change your mind, honey. Just let me know.
AID00138321	<75 caps needed> I don't have enough caps on me.
AID00138322	Well, I'm not a goddamn charity, so come back when you do.
AID00138323	<75 caps> What the hell. Let's do it.
AID00138324	You won't notice anything once the lights are out, hon. The places that count are still firm enough...
AID00138325	Well, don't just stand there. I ain't getting any younger.
AID00138326	Goodbye.
AID00138327	You know where to find me, honey.
AID00138328	Good luck.
AID00138329	I'd like your services.
AID00138330	Best prices around so long as you don't try putting anything someplace it was never intended. How's that sound?
AID00138331	If you're looking to get perverted, go talk to Sweetie. She's less particular than I am.
AID00138332	No discounts for repeat customers... I think we did it before, anyways.
AID00138333	Tell me about Sweetie.
AID00138334	She's a good earner. Of course, she don't care who she sleeps with or what they do to her.
AID00138335	You work for Pretty Sarah?
AID00138336	That's right. Strange at first, having a woman for a pimp, but she's tough enough to handle any trouble so far.
AID00138337	Aren't you kind of old to be doing this?
AID00138338	Old but spry, honey. So long as my back don't give out, I can make a living lying on it.
AID00138339	May not be as fresh as Sweetie or Jimmy, but Pretty Sarah keeps me around for a good reason - experience!
AID00138340	Let's talk about something else.
AID00138341	Sure.
AID00138342	Never mind.
AID00138343	All right, then.
AID00138344	I had questions about your tenants.
AID00138345	Like who?
AID00138346	I'd like you to go back to the Lucky 38 for now.
AID00138347	I'll make my way there.
AID00138348	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
AID00138349	Back to the tomb, I suppose. If you need me, et cetera.
AID00138350	Nice! Can I order room service?
AID00138351	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
AID00138352	<Makes beeping sounds>
AID00138353	<Companion Protocol::Return Base>
AID00138354	Hey, as long as you're not asking me to go back to Black Mountain, I'm a happy old man.
AID00138355	It is. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
AID00138356	<bark!>
AID00138357	All right... don't be long. Robots there give me the creeps.
AID00138358	All right. Guess Vegas it is.
AID00138359	Back to the gilded cage.
AID00138360	Nice children shouldn't stay in places like that, dearie! That's the sort of place Leo likes! But if you insist....
AID00138361	You're not one of the merchandise?
AID00138362	Most of my body is scarred all over, like a ghoul. Nobody around who'd want to screw that. No, I just run things.
AID00138363	How did you all break out?
AID00138364	Dynamite. Lots and lots of dynamite. You should've seen the body parts flying everywhere.
AID00138365	What did you do to end up in here?
AID00138366	Not much, just killed a bunch of people. Maybe a couple of kids, too. Whatever.
AID00138367	Goodbye.
AID00138368	That's right. Fuck off.
AID00138369	Why are you called Scrambler?
AID00138370	Why? It's because I mess up people so bad they don't know what part goes where when I'm done.
AID00138371	Does that mean you'll take the law into your own hands?
AID00138372	When I need to, yes.
AID00138373	I'll need to think about it.
AID00138374	Understood.
AID00138375	You have a deal.
AID00138376	All right, then. Guess I'll just make a quiet exit - no need for a goodbye party or anything.
AID00138377	How would you feel about becoming Primm's new sheriff?
AID00138378	Assuming an NCR pardon comes with the job - and it had better - I'll also need to be able to do things my own way.
AID00138379	Due process has its place, but sometimes it's just a waste of time. I'll need to know that I'm not going to end up right back in prison.
AID00138380	My terms are the same. A pardon from the NCR and the freedom to do the job anyway I see fit.
AID00138381	Goodbye.
AID00138382	Yeah, get out of here.
AID00138383	Where can I find your whores?
AID00138384	You should probably be talking to somebody else.
AID00138385	Answer the question.
AID00138386	Can I set him free?
AID00138387	You need to work on your bloodthirst. We won't speak again until Benny is dead.
AID00138388	Walk away if you want, but if you do, he's going up on a cross. You're still making a choice.
AID00138389	I don't want to decide.
AID00138390	What's wrong with you? This man shot you, stole from you, left you in the desert to die.
AID00138391	Thank you, Caesar.
AID00138392	Consider it the first of many bestowments.
AID00138393	[Continue]
AID00138394	We had packed the old city with C4 and dynamite. Crude, but it did the job. Those who didn't die in the blast were in no position to mount a defense.
AID00138395	The ones left on the dam didn't know what to do. The troopers routed them. Graham pulled the remaining legionaries back, but the battle was over.
AID00138396	He went south, back to the Grand Canyon, back to Caesar. And that was the last we saw or heard from Joshua Graham.
AID00138397	[Continue]
AID00138398	Caused total chaos among the younger legionaries, and Oliver's troopers fell back to the side walkways and stayed out of the veterans' way.
AID00138399	By the time the veterans got to the ridge, we were already in Boulder City.
AID00138400	They followed us down there, but we were out before they realized what was happening.
AID00138401	[Continue]
AID00138402	But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
AID00138403	That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
AID00138404	That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
AID00138405	[Continue]
AID00138406	Joshua Graham, Caesar's old legate, he's wasn't so flexible.
AID00138407	When the Legion attacked Hoover Dam, General Oliver ordered his troopers back to the middle ground just after first contact.
AID00138408	Graham pushed all of the legionaries onto the dam, filling the east side with recruits up front and veterans in the back, by the book.
AID00138409	[Continue]
AID00138410	I told him we would take them back into NCR territory because we had already lost ten rangers on the way out. Ten rangers, five men with .308 rifles.
AID00138411	Well, that was enough for them. They packed up what they could and we took them back north. Last I heard, they settled somewhere in Anza-Borrego.
AID00138412	Raised Bighorners. Had some tough times, but it worked out okay for them. So there you go. That's my one bit of good.
AID00138413	[Continue]
AID00138414	They had planted an NCR flag over the well and they would not budge until every last one of them was laid out, dead and cold.
AID00138415	So I walked up and told them there was a group of raiders coming, one hundred strong. I made up some cockamamie name for them and everything.
AID00138416	The men looked at each other, looked at us, and asked me what we were going to do about it.
AID00138417	[Continue]
AID00138418	There's over two dozen bodies lying in the dunes way outside of town and five men with .308 rifles crouched behind sand bags.
AID00138419	And these bodies, these people out in the sand, they aren't raiders. Aren't even heavily armed.
AID00138420	They're just people who were trying to get to the only well in fifty miles. I didn't have to talk to the men to see that they did not care one bit.
AID00138421	[Continue]
AID00138422	Word got back to one of our stations that raiders had been attacking the place. I went out with six rangers.
AID00138423	We must have been on the trail for a week before we got to Rattletail. We lost one woman to Night Stalkers and another almost died of dehydration.
AID00138424	When we reach the place, it's six shacks set up around an old well.
AID00138425	So what happened at Hoover Dam and Boulder City?
AID00138426	In big battles, Caesar deploys his legionaries in waves. Recruits up front, prime soldiers behind the recruits, old guard bringing up the rear.
AID00138427	Opponents wear themselves out dealing with the first two waves, if they survive that long. When the veterans step up, there's not much fight left.
AID00138428	Caesar can adapt, though, and when required, he can run any mix of legionaries as skirmishers and still retain order in the ranks.
AID00138429	Come on. You must have lots of stories.
AID00138430	[FAILED] I do, but I'm tired of telling them. Time changes how you look at things.
AID00138431	There must be something good the rangers have done that you're proud of.
AID00138432	[SUCCEEDED] It's kind of a long one, but all right. About twenty, twenty-five years ago, a group of NCR settlers pushed way south into Baja.
AID00138433	I guess it doesn't seem so far now if you look at a map, but back then, they were out a ways.
AID00138434	They built this little shanty town around a well in the middle of nowhere. Called it Rattletail.
AID00138435	What are you actually doing?
AID00138436	Sitting on the shore of Lake Mead, looking east. Listening to a radio. Trying to not get too many people killed.
AID00138437	I'm too old to be slapping leather, but I had hoped for something else. More than this, anyway.
AID00138438	Okay, what are you supposed to be doing?
AID00138439	"To protect against all forms of tyranny." As simple as that. Thirty, forty years ago, the wasteland was full of despots.
AID00138440	Slavers. Raiders. Tough-talking hoodlums with gangs who liked to kick around towns. Back then the NCR military was still young.
AID00138441	Couldn't cover much ground. It took groups like ours to tip the balance back to the good guys.
AID00138442	Why are the rangers here?
AID00138443	There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
AID00138444	Nevada had its own posse, the Desert Rangers. They fought Caesar even farther east, out in Arizona. Didn't go well for them.
AID00138445	Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
AID00138446	What do the rangers do?
AID00138447	Well, there's what we're supposed to be doing and what we're actually doing.
AID00138448	There's a big gap between those two things, about as wide as that lake out there.
AID00138449	How long have you been in the rangers?
AID00138450	Oh, well. I guess it must be coming up on... forty years or so. Back before Elise was chief, anyway. It was a heck of a lot harder then.
AID00138451	Weren't as many of us to go around. But I think it was a lot easier to tell the good guys from the bad.
AID00138452	Have any good stories to tell?
AID00138453	Suppose it depends on what you think is "good." Most folks want to hear about Hoover Dam and Boulder City, but it's a long story.
AID00138454	If you want some tall tales about hunting down slavers or busting up gangs, talk to one of the younger rangers.
AID00138455	Who are the praetorians?
AID00138456	Caesar's elite guard. They travel with him wherever he goes. A bit of insurance in case any of his guests get funny ideas.
AID00138457	They aren't the toughest legionaries, but they're the most devoted to Caesar. They believe in everything the Legion stands for.
AID00138458	Tell me about centurions.
AID00138459	There's no real equivalent to them in the NCR. Centurions are battle-born, elite officers who earned their rank with blood and sweat.
AID00138460	They wear special outfits, too, pieced together from the armor of all their defeated enemies. Good commanders, tough opponents.
AID00138461	What makes the veterans so tough?
AID00138462	Take a regular legionary and age him ten years. Whatever they lose to age they make up for with experience. Life expectancy isn't long in the Legion.
AID00138463	You live ten years in Caesar's army, you're a force to be reckoned with.
AID00138464	Was Graham a good commander?
AID00138465	He wasn't a brilliant strategist. Wasn't tactically flexible, either. There was something about him, though. Menace, indestructibility.
AID00138466	It made everyone afraid of him. Heck, the praetorians burned Graham four years ago and some of the tribes are still afraid of him.
AID00138467	They say the Burned Man still walks the land, blackens the earth wherever he sets foot.
AID00138468	How bad was Graham?
AID00138469	He was a missionary from Utah who hooked up with Caesar at the Grand Canyon, became his translator.
AID00138470	Graham helped Caesar with the Blackfoots after they got captured together. Up until Hoover Dam, he was Caesar's legate.
AID00138471	You wouldn't think a man of god could turn so brutal. Cruel to his opponents. Did the sort of things that make you sick to talk about.
AID00138472	Why do they call Lanius the Monster of the East?
AID00138473	Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops peoples' heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
AID00138474	Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
AID00138475	But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
AID00138476	Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
AID00138477	[Continue]
AID00138478	I can't say I think the legionaries at Cottonwood deserved the same fate, but what's done is done.
AID00138479	Thanks to you, that's one less pack of slavers for people to worry about.
AID00138480	[Continue]
AID00138481	By the way, I appreciate what you did for the troopers down there.
AID00138482	Nelson might not be the most strategically important place, but taking Dead Sea out means a lot to them.
AID00138483	What happened at Searchlight?
AID00138484	Searchlight was worse. One of Caesar's frumentarii must have found something in there, flooded the whole camp with radiation.
AID00138485	Tell me about Nelson.
AID00138486	Nelson was barely set up. We had a big stretch of unprotected land between Forlorn Hope and Searchlight, and Nelson was the solution.
AID00138487	A decanus named Dead Sea took the place and caused a lot of damage.
AID00138488	Tell me about the heavy troopers.
AID00138489	They have the best equipment the NCR can get its hands on, power armor salvaged from our war with the Brotherhood.
AID00138490	Techs strip out the joint servos so you don't need special training to wear it.
AID00138491	It feels like you're carrying a Brahmin on your back, but it can take a heck of a lot of punishment.
AID00138492	What do the new rangers mean for NCR?
AID00138493	The Baja rangers can do more advance night scouting and sharpshooting to assist the troopers.
AID00138494	Ranger combat helmets are old Pre-War gear. They have built in low-light optics. Makes a big difference.
AID00138495	Is Moore in charge of all the NCR troopers out here?
AID00138496	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
AID00138497	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore, but he's got the Fiends to deal with.
AID00138498	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that.  Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
AID00138499	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
AID00138500	Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
AID00138501	Colonel Moore's "way"?
AID00138502	The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
AID00138503	Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
AID00138504	She's better at making graves than making friends. Bring in Moore and the earth will be razed. Fields will be salted.
AID00138505	Tell me about General Oliver.
AID00138506	Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
AID00138507	Maybe it's best that I just say that he is a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
AID00138508	What about the troopers?
AID00138509	You've seen it yourself. Some of them don't even have proper service rifles or armor.
AID00138510	Our heavy infantry, power armor units, they're back in NCR territory protecting the interests of Brahmin barons against small-time raiders.
AID00138511	Brahmin barons only have one vote at the ballot box, but they have a lot of money to throw around.
AID00138512	What's going on in Baja?
AID00138513	It's complicated. Goes way back. I told President Kimball that we need more rangers here.
AID00138514	He accepted that, but took the most experienced ones and sent them south. Patrol rangers are good men and women, but we're about to fight a war.
AID00138515	Why are funds tied up at the Boneyard?
AID00138516	Senate elections are coming up. Local representatives don't want to push any more funding to the Mojave campaign because it's unpopular.
AID00138517	Most of the folks around the Boneyard haven't been to New Vegas and probably never will.
AID00138518	All they know is that their money gets sucked away to this desert and their brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters die here.
AID00138519	So that was the end of Graham?
AID00138520	It's not that clear cut. You have to understand, Graham was the toughest son of a gun anyone around these parts had ever seen.
AID00138521	Before Hoover, we had five kill reports on Graham from rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters who tried to take him out.
AID00138522	Some folks think he's still alive, call him the Burned Man.
AID00138523	Are the Blackfoots part of the Legion?
AID00138524	Yes and no. The Blackfoots don't exist anymore, just like any other tribe that gets swallowed by the Legion.
AID00138525	Caesar takes the tribal out of the tribe. Scrapes and burns off tattoos, breaks up families, forces mixed breeding so all the old loyalties die away.
AID00138526	The only tribe in the Legion is the Legion. Caesar is their chief, father, and god all rolled into one.
AID00138527	What happened to Graham after Hoover Dam?
AID00138528	Losing the dam was the worst defeat the Legion ever suffered. Graham had been with Caesar since the beginning, but he had to set an example.
AID00138529	The praetorians covered Graham in pitch, lit him on fire, and down into the Grand Canyon he went.
AID00138530	How did a Follower wind up becoming Caesar?
AID00138531	Somewhere along the way, he realized he needed to educate the Blackfoots or they were going to get wiped out with the rest of the tribe.
AID00138532	Showed them how to use guns, how to make explosives. Once he taught the Blackfoots a thing or two, they needed him.
AID00138533	And he no longer needed the Followers, NCR, or anyone else. He decided he could remake the tribes of the southwest, whether they wanted it or not.
AID00138534	He became Caesar and Joshua Graham became his legate, his right hand. And that's where Graham stayed until Hoover Dam.
AID00138535	Where did he go?
AID00138536	Out to the Grand Canyon. He met a missionary from Utah, a man by the name of Joshua Graham. Graham helped translate for the Followers and the tribes.
AID00138537	All three of them got nabbed by the Blackfoots down there, back when they were still at war with every other tribe in the southwest.
AID00138538	Fires?
AID00138539	Legion fires. They burn high wherever the Legion goes.
AID00138540	Caesar's a hard man to figure out, but he always wants you to know when more troops are at your front door.
AID00138541	Doesn't matter. Your time's up, Hanlon.
AID00138542	Well, you got that right.
AID00138543	Fine. I'll turn you in.
AID00138544	I can't let you do this. I have to turn you in.
AID00138545	You've convinced me. Your secret is safe.
AID00138546	I don't know if you're working for Caesar or if desperation's made me a heck of a lot more persuasive. Either way, this is the right thing to do.
AID00138547	Now, I trust we're done discussing this. I'm going to step through that door and pretend like we never had this talk.
AID00138548	Caesar is sick. Like... really sick. He could drop any day.
AID00138549	Caesar's dead. What more do you need?
AID00138550	The Legion is more than just Caesar! It's got the momentum of thousands of men behind it.
AID00138551	They're not just going to roll off into Arizona if we give them a good shove.
AID00138552	Caesar's sick. He won't live long. The Legion will fall apart a few years after he's gone.
AID00138553	Caesar's dead. The Legion can't hold itself together for five years, much less ten.
AID00138554	It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
AID00138555	For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
AID00138556	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
AID00138557	That's crazy.
AID00138558	Maybe fifty rangers will die on that dam. We lose over a thousand troopers every year. Being here is crazy. Getting out's the only sane thing to do.
AID00138559	What about you and the rangers?
AID00138560	Rangers are volunteers. Every man and woman who signs up is willing to die for the NCR, myself included.
AID00138561	A lot of this is my fault. It's only right that I stand with them.
AID00138562	What will you do if I don't turn you in?
AID00138563	Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted them on the ridge.
AID00138564	He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
AID00138565	If the troopers fall back, and they will, the rangers will advance to cover Oliver's retreat. We lose the dam, Oliver and the senate are ruined.
AID00138566	Too bad. I'm turning you in.
AID00138567	Fair enough. You want to do this the right way, go get one of the rangers. Don't worry. I'm not gonna run out on you.
AID00138568	But what does that accomplish?
AID00138569	Creating fear and instability among the troopers without causing harm, it's the only thing I could think of to shake things up.
AID00138570	It took some people getting killed to realize I had gone too far. I had to stop.
AID00138571	You're dead.
AID00138572	Hold on. This is ranger headquarters. There might be a dozen rangers within earshot.
AID00138573	Think twice before you decide to give the old chief a gut full of lead.
AID00138574	What do you think I should do about this?
AID00138575	First thing that comes to mind is to turn me in. But that might not be the best play, all things considered.
AID00138576	Even if your heart's in the right place, I reckon it might do a lot more harm than good.
AID00138577	How does spreading false intel help anything?
AID00138578	People back home don't listen. They don't care. Senators, Brahmin barons, folks who are just trying to make it from day to day.
AID00138579	It's been so many years that people forget about it. Conscription brings in fresh troops to die here every month. Like it's routine.
AID00138580	And even if we hold this dam, what then? Are we going to send the NCR's men and women to die here for another five years? Ten?
AID00138581	Patrol the whole length of the Colorado for hundreds of miles? Holding this dam. It'll be the death of us.
AID00138582	Aren't you fighting for the people of New Vegas?
AID00138583	We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
AID00138584	They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
AID00138585	Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
AID00138586	Why did you do it?
AID00138587	It's never going to end. This fight with Caesar. People back home don't know what these young men and women are in for.
AID00138588	The Legion is the worst enemy we've ever faced, but we can't stop Caesar here, not without getting a lot of good people killed.
AID00138589	More than anyone cares to count up. And even if we do stop him, I don't see how we're ever going to be able to pull out.
AID00138590	But you're inventing your own intelligence reports. I've seen the logs and talked to the rangers.
AID00138591	You have, have you? Misdirection. When you're pinned down, outnumbered, and two days from any help, it's just about the best friend you can have.
AID00138592	Misdirection's what's saved me all these years. It's what saved us at Hoover Dam. But it's been five years now and Caesar's right across that lake.
AID00138593	He's closer now than he ever was before. I was a young man once. I know what it's like to want to fight for your home, but this isn't it.
AID00138594	Why don't the ranger stations send the intel directly to the troopers?
AID00138595	Comm rangers might have an incomplete picture of the situation. There's a lot going on out there.
AID00138596	Intel needs to be coordinated through Golf so we can verify and advise appropriately.
AID00138597	Troopers have enough to deal with. We don't want them questioning their intel.
AID00138598	How do you coordinate the intel?
AID00138599	It's a simple system, when it works. Patrol rangers radio intel to ranger stations.
AID00138600	Comm rangers send the intel up the station chain until it reaches Camp Golf.
AID00138601	Then I or one of the other rangers on duty organize the data, evaluate it, and send information to camps or troopers in the field.
AID00138602	Can you give me any advice?
AID00138603	Well... the logical thing to do is to check with the patrol rangers and comm officers. Don't be too discouraged if some things don't match up.
AID00138604	Different people see different things, and sometimes the meaning gets twisted, lost in static from person to person.
AID00138605	Do you know anything about the problems?
AID00138606	I don't know Technical Sergeant Reyes, but coordinating intel can be messy sometimes. Things get mixed up, people get confused.
AID00138607	Heck, I get confused and I've been doing this for a long time now. What he - or she - sees as a problem might be standard operating procedure.
AID00138608	That's not to say Reyes is wrong for being concerned, but it's easy for the sand to get in your eyes out here.
AID00138609	I know you're the one who's been manipulating intelligence data.
AID00138610	Hold on. If we're going to have this conversation, let's go somewhere more private.
AID00138611	Don't worry. Not much bite left in this old dog.
AID00138612	I'm investigating some intel problems for Technical Sergeant Reyes.
AID00138613	Interesting that she would wrangle someone else into sorting out the problem.
AID00138614	But I suppose you're in the right place. A lot of intel comes through here.
AID00138615	This again? All right. What do you want to know?
AID00138616	Do you ever stop talking?
AID00138617	I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
AID00138618	I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for a war out there.
AID00138619	Tell me about the rangers.
AID00138620	I could tell you a lot if you had the time, but at my age I'm not sure which of us would get tired first. What do you want to know?
AID00138621	What's the Legion been up to?
AID00138622	Not too long ago, they took Nelson and Searchlight.
AID00138623	They've got some camps on the eastern shore of the Colorado, and the monstrosity on the hill across the lake - that's for Caesar.
AID00138624	Some folks don't believe he's here yet, but you can tell. He's the eye of the storm. It all roils and spins around him.
AID00138625	You don't have to see the man to see the effect he has.
AID00138626	Intel says the legate's coming. Lanius. They call him the Monster of the East. If he's half as bad as Graham was, we're in for a heck of a fight.
AID00138627	With Caesar and a new legate here, the Legion's not going to fall for the same old bag of tricks.
AID00138628	Word is that the Legion's old timers have shown up, Caesar's veterans from the Red Okie Centuria and what was the Painted Rock tribe.
AID00138629	They're the best of the best and the baddest of the bad. Short of a centurion or praetorian, they don't come any tougher.
AID00138630	You come across a pack of them, weigh your options carefully.
AID00138631	How is NCR doing?
AID00138632	It's no secret that we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
AID00138633	We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
AID00138634	NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down in Baja.
AID00138635	Even Caesar knows that General Oliver's coming back to Hoover. Colonel Moore's doing a fine job of running things over at the dam.
AID00138636	In her own way, of course, when she's not trying to wrangle my rangers into helping her.
AID00138637	But just keeping that dam secure and operational day to day is enough work for one person, never mind building a defense against the Legion.
AID00138638	Mojave Outpost sent word through the stations. The rangers coming up from Baja moved through Dayglow a week ago.
AID00138639	Some of the patrol rangers have reported that Oliver's power armor heavy troopers are starting to reinforce the front lines.
AID00138640	Wish they got here a bit earlier, but that's the senate for you.
AID00138641	What do you know about Caesar?
AID00138642	The best of the best, worst of the worst. He came out of NCR, one of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00138643	Like a lot of the Followers, he went out in the wilderness with a partner to try to help those who needed helping.
AID00138644	Not much different from how the rangers used to be, except with books and medicine instead of guns.
AID00138645	Tell me about yourself.
AID00138646	Folks around here call me the chief, but Hanlon's just fine. The rangers run themselves pretty well, but I try to lend a hand.
AID00138647	Mostly administrative work, helping coordinate intel on the radio. That and keeping an eye on the fires growing across the water.
AID00138648	Goodbye.
AID00138649	Letting you just walk away isn't how it works, I'm afraid.
AID00138650	< Speech 30 >
AID00138651	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Pickings were getting slim around here anyway.
AID00138652	Eddie's just going to keep chasing you. Quit while you're ahead... and alive.
AID00138653	[FAILED] Nope, not interested. No caps in letting people walk, you know.
AID00138654	How about you walk away and I'll do the same? That way it's easy on both of us.
AID00138655	I'm not going to let you live.
AID00138656	Get him!
AID00138657	Get her!
AID00138658	< Cock your head and grin. >
AID00138659	Run!
AID00138660	Eddie sent me to deal with you.
AID00138661	That's nothing new. Am I supposed to be impressed?
AID00138662	You only want me to deal with Chavez?
AID00138663	Chavez is the ringleader. Without him, his crew will fall apart, and I don't give a shit about those guys.
AID00138664	I'll need to think about this.
AID00138665	Fuck you for wasting my time, then.
AID00138666	I'll do it.
AID00138667	Good. Chavez and his boys were last seen south of here. If you're lucky and he's careless, he might still be there.
AID00138668	< Keep holdout weapons. > Sure, here you go.
AID00138669	You are free to leave.
AID00138670	Goodbye.
AID00138671	Vale.
AID00138672	Here you go.
AID00138673	You are free to leave.
AID00138674	Caesar wants to talk to me about being sick.
AID00138675	Done.
AID00138676	Put Caesar in a coma.
AID00138677	The old guy is now in a coma.
AID00138678	Let's finish this, then.
AID00138679	Avenge Caesar!
AID00138680	< Medicine 50 >
AID00138681	[SUCCEEDED] I apologize for my rash action. I understand fighting and killing, not healing. I acted out of grief and loyalty.
AID00138682	The cranial bleeding was too much for a man of his age. A younger man would have lived.
AID00138683	[FAILED] It's obvious you know as little about medicine as I do. Spare me your excuses.
AID00138684	There was, uh, internal bleeding and lesions and other problems.
AID00138685	< Speech 50 >
AID00138686	[SUCCEEDED] What you say is true. I apologize for my rash action - it was out of grief and loyalty. I hope you understand.
AID00138687	Caesar would be dead if I didn't try to help him. How dare you blame me for trying to save his life!
AID00138688	[FAILED] Save your excuses.
AID00138689	Hey, it totally wasn't my fault that he died. He was old.
AID00138690	President Kimball survived the assassination attempt.
AID00138691	Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
AID00138692	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
AID00138693	President Kimball is dead.
AID00138694	The loss of morale in the NCR must have been staggering when their leader fell. It's proof that no one is out of the Legion's reach.
AID00138695	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
AID00138696	The Brotherhood of Steel will aid us against the NCR.
AID00138697	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00138698	I wasn't able to get the support of the White Glove Society.
AID00138699	The White Glove Society is now an ally of the Legion.
AID00138700	The Boomer leadership has been neutralized.
AID00138701	The Boomers will come when I call them.
AID00138702	No problem, I'll head up by myself.
AID00138703	Come back soon, now!
AID00138704	I go where I please! <Attack>
AID00138705	Oh boy.
AID00138706	No deal.
AID00138707	The Boss is pretty clear on this. I can't let you in unless you're by your lonesome.
AID00138708	I'm not ready yet.
AID00138709	See ya soon!
AID00138710	
AID00138711	We are here as promised. Now let's kick some ass.
AID00138712	vHDNCRBattleAdvance
AID00138713	On second thought, never mind...
AID00138714	Okay! Anything else?
AID00138715	Hold still a minute. I want to upgrade your programming.
AID00138716	Benny stole a platinum chip from me. Do you know what it's for?
AID00138717	You're very... forthcoming with that information.
AID00138718	What's Benny planning to do with the Platinum Chip?
AID00138719	How come you work for Benny and not Mr. House?
AID00138720	"Yes Man?" What kind of a name is that?
AID00138721	What's a Securitron doing in a hole in Benny's closet?
AID00138722	Have you seen Benny?
AID00138723	<Destroy the dam generators.>
AID00138724	<Turn on Securitrons.>
AID00138725	What? You think this is my fault?
AID00138726	His head exploded, idiot. Of course it's your fault. Avenge Caesar!
AID00138727	Oh, well. At least I'm good at killing.
AID00138728	What do you know about Legate Lanius?
AID00138729	The Legate is not a man to be crossed, especially if you're a woman. That's all I will say about it.
AID00138730	Tell me about the Burned Man.
AID00138731	A vengeful spirit, some of the more superstitious women claim. He was a great leader of the Legion before he failed Caesar.
AID00138732	The story says he was set on fire and thrown into the Grand Canyon, but his angry spirit rose from the ashes of his corpse, looking for revenge.
AID00138733	Nonsense, probably, but there's no doubt that many in the Legion believe he's still alive somehow.
AID00138734	What do you know about the Burned Man?
AID00138735	He's a story to frighten the younger Legionaries. He's dead - no man, no matter how tough, could survive a fall into the Grand Canyon.
AID00138736	What can you tell me about Legate Lanius?
AID00138737	It took years for Caesar to conquer Lanius' tribe, and Caesar showed mercy to the survivors, allowing them to join the Legion.
AID00138738	Had the positions been reversed, Caesar would be dead. Lanius is called the Monster of the East because he never, ever shows mercy.
AID00138739	What do you know about the Burned Man?
AID00138740	It's not something we like to speak of. The Burned Man was our greatest warrior, even greater than Legate Lanius, but he failed Caesar at the Dam.
AID00138741	He's been dead for several years now, but the rumor is that Caesar has scouts out looking for him all the same. The Burned Man was a very tough man.
AID00138742	Ask someone else, woman.
AID00138743	What can you tell me about the Legate?
AID00138744	A great warrior. When he was but a recruit, I watched him kill ten men in the arena with his bare hands.
AID00138745	He doesn't feel pain and he never, ever shows mercy. If all Legionaries were like him, the Legion would be invincible.
AID00138746	What can you tell me about the Legate?
AID00138747	To call Lanius ferocious would be an understatement. In battle, he seizes the enemy in his jaws and will not let go.
AID00138748	He thinks nothing of suffering losses, so long as the enemy suffers more. Though unsubtle, he is not dim. He detects traps, and sets his own.
AID00138749	Be glad you will not have to face his judgment... if you are true to Caesar.
AID00138750	Lanius served Caesar well, as his greatest battlefield commander.
AID00138751	With Lanius at the head of the Legion, however, I doubt he'll have much use for my services. He prefers... direct methods.
AID00138752	After everything I've done for the Legion, this one failure condemns me?
AID00138753	No... I suppose not. You've proved that you're a friend to us many times. I apologize for my temper.
AID00138754	I did all I could to save him.
AID00138755	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
AID00138756	<Lie> I did all I could to save him.
AID00138757	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
AID00138758	<Start Combat> Enough talk!
AID00138759	You'll regret this!
AID00138760	It's important that I get in there.
AID00138761	It's probably more important that you get out of here alive. If you haven't noticed, there's a battle going on here.
AID00138762	Now get out of here!
AID00138763	[Armor Check]
AID00138764	Friend or not, no one is allowed in here. Move along!
AID00138765	It's okay I'm a friend.
AID00138766	All right, but make it quick.
AID00138767	[Lie] I've been ordered to get something for Colonel Moore, let me in.
AID00138768	[Speech Check]
AID00138769	Damn it all to hell! Let's go!
AID00138770	<Lie> Colonel Moore is in trouble! She needs help now!
AID00138771	Our instructions were pretty clear. Now you better get your ass out of here.
AID00138772	Don't you have anything better to do right now than guard this door?
AID00138773	<Warning 2>
AID00138774	I warned you!
AID00138775	<Warning 1>
AID00138776	Stop right there, no one is allowed into the control room!
AID00138777	If Caesar dies, who takes over the Legion?
AID00138778	Legate Lanius will take Caesar's place at the head of the Legion. The Legate is a fine warrior, and the Legion will do well under his command.
AID00138779	Goodbye.
AID00138780	Adios.
AID00138781	Let's talk about something else.
AID00138782	Shoot.
AID00138783	Tell me about the Burned Man.
AID00138784	Ah, yes - we are forbidden from speaking his true name. He was a shaman of some kind before he met Caesar, a holy man from out of the Utah.
AID00138785	The Burned Man proved dangerous, unpredictable, and impossible to kill. He helped Caesar form the Legion but almost led it to destruction.
AID00138786	Tell me about the Burned Man.
AID00138787	The Burned Man was Caesar's advisor and general when the Legion was originally formed. The Burned Man led us to a disastrous defeat at the Dam.
AID00138788	On Caesar's orders, the Burned Man was covered in pitch by the Praetorian Guard, lit on fire, and cast into the Grand Canyon.
AID00138789	Caesar has forbidden us from ever speaking his true name again, and so we simply refer to him as the Burned Man.
AID00138790	Tell me about the Legate.
AID00138791	He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
AID00138792	He killed one of my pack Brahmin simply because it was in his way. I knew better than to complain about it, though.
AID00138793	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker.
AID00138794	You really know how to make a robot happy! Seriously, you just made my day.
AID00138795	Forget the Boomers. I want nothing to do with them.
AID00138796	Okay! Who needs artillery support? Not the good guys, that's for sure!
AID00138797	Let's talk about something else.
AID00138798	Sorry if that was getting boring!
AID00138799	If you're tired of a topic, I'm tired of it, too!
AID00138800	Whatever you say!
AID00138801	You bet!
AID00138802	What should we talk about next?
AID00138803	It took some doing, but I convinced the White Glove Society to support Caesar's Legion.
AID00138804	You did? That's... that's an unusual approach!
AID00138805	But I know it makes sense somehow if you're the one doing it! The problem is me!
AID00138806	The White Glove Society needed a little help getting back to basics, that's all.
AID00138807	That's great news! I wish I could visit their casino! They have a refined sense of taste!
AID00138808	The White Glove Society had a cannibalism problem, but I solved it.
AID00138809	A cannibalism problem? Really? I'm so glad you weren't eaten!
AID00138810	I spoke to Marjorie and Mortimer. I say leave the White Glove Society alone.
AID00138811	Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
AID00138812	I helped the Omertas perfect their plan to slaughter everyone on the Strip.
AID00138813	You'd think it'd be bad for the Strip but... but I guess it must be good!
AID00138814	Yeah - take the Strip down a notch or two, right? That'll show it! Okay!
AID00138815	The Omertas were plotting to destroy the Strip, so I killed the conspirators.
AID00138816	Wow! That is amazing! You are just - a hero! I am serious!
AID00138817	I know enough about the Omertas to know I want them left alone.
AID00138818	You got it! I won't say another word about them!
AID00138819	I've convinced the Brotherhood to support the NCR.
AID00138820	Really? That's... well, that's a surprise! They'll really want to blow me up!
AID00138821	But maybe dumb machines like me ought to get blown up and scrapped for salvage. Who knows? Not me!
AID00138822	I know the Brotherhood. I want them left alone.
AID00138823	Okay! Consider them forgotten! Along with the projections that predict they'll be our biggest enemy! Forgotten!
AID00138824	I've set the Great Khans on a path of destruction.
AID00138825	Oooh, sounds dramatic! I like it! Wind them up and let them go!
AID00138826	No more Khans! That's great! They're just bad people...
AID00138827	I convinced the Great Khans to leave the Mojave.
AID00138828	Maybe they'll be devoured by giant scorpions! All sorts of things could happen to them out there!
AID00138829	I've convinced the Great Khans to support the NCR.
AID00138830	Really? Okay! That sounds fun!
AID00138831	That's not aiding an enemy! Not when you do it!
AID00138832	The Great Khans have been wiped out.
AID00138833	Yay, that's great news! You finished what Mr. House and the NCR started! That's got to feel good!
AID00138834	I've visited the Khans' settlement at Red Rock Canyon. They can be ignored.
AID00138835	If you say so! Consider them filed away under "not to be discussed again!"
AID00138836	What do you know about the Omertas?
AID00138837	Hmm. I remember that Benny used to pay a receptionist at Gomorrah for information - maybe she knows something!
AID00138838	Just that Benny didn't like them! He talked on and on about how they couldn't be trusted! And this is coming from Benny!
AID00138839	He hated their casino, said it was tacky! And he thought they were up to something, because he said they always are!
AID00138840	Do you know anything else about the Omertas?
AID00138841	Whenever you get around to it will be just fine!
AID00138842	I'll check into the Omertas some more.
AID00138843	Where should I look for the Brotherhood of Steel?
AID00138844	Some of Mr. House's data said that he'd lost a bunch of Securitron scouts near Hidden Valley!
AID00138845	Telemetry showed that they'd been attacked with energy weapons! House was pretty sure it was the Brotherhood!
AID00138846	There must be a bunch of them holed up there! Not a good place for a robot to visit!
AID00138847	They go around in big suits of power armor, and they have lots of energy weapons! But there's a downside!
AID00138848	They just have a thing about technology! They think it should all be theirs! If someone else has it, they get mad!
AID00138849	All I'm saying is, not much of a chance they'll accept a Vegas that polices itself with robots!
AID00138850	What do you know about the Brotherhood of Steel?
AID00138851	No rush! Take your time!
AID00138852	I'm not ready to decide what I want to do with the Brotherhood.
AID00138853	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
AID00138854	From what I understand, they're perfectly delightful! They're cultured, clean, and super-polite!
AID00138855	Benny didn't like them, though! He said they were "creepy."
AID00138856	Don't hurry on my account! I'm the one with the flexible schedule.
AID00138857	I'll let you know when I'm done evaluating the White Glove Society.
AID00138858	What do you know about the Boomers?
AID00138859	They must be a really nasty people! I haven't heard a single good thing about them!
AID00138860	They fire artillery on anyone who comes near their settlement at Nellis Air Force Base. Talk about rude!
AID00138861	If they can be convinced to fire those big cannons at the Legion or NCR, though, well - that'd be neat, wouldn't it?
AID00138862	Take all the time you need!
AID00138863	I'll get back to you about the Boomers.
AID00138864	Tell me what you know about the Great Khans.
AID00138865	The Khans are just... they're a dirty people. They live in tents like animals! And they're very rude!
AID00138866	They've been kicked around a lot, but no one's finished them off! Not yet, anyway!
AID00138867	They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed!
AID00138868	So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them!
AID00138869	So then they settle at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!
AID00138870	How have the Khans been kicked around?
AID00138871	You set the pace.
AID00138872	I need to take some more time with the Khans.
AID00138873	I'm familiar with the Boomers. They can be ignored.
AID00138874	Then consider them ignored! If they end up firing their howitzers at us, we'll ignore that, too! Until it goes away!
AID00138875	The Boomers won't be a problem anymore. I killed their leaders.
AID00138876	Problem solved! Quick and to the point! I like the way you work!
AID00138877	The Boomers have vowed to support me.
AID00138878	Really? Talk about diplomatic skills! I mean, just not getting blown up was a success!
AID00138879	Now they'll only blow up the right sorts of people! That's what matters!
AID00138880	Let's talk about the tribes I should "get to know."
AID00138881	Of course! Ask away!
AID00138882	Please go on!
AID00138883	That's one down, four to go.
AID00138884	That's two down, three to go.
AID00138885	That's three down, two to go.
AID00138886	That's four down, just one to go.
AID00138887	That accounts for all the tribes you needed to get to know!
AID00138888	Anything else I can help with?
AID00138889	So I should ask these tribes if they'll support an Independent Vegas?
AID00138890	Oh no, I didn't mean that! Who needs their support? The Securitrons will be all the support you need!
AID00138891	What I meant is, you should get to know these tribes and decide which ones you like and which you don't!
AID00138892	You know - shape the future of Vegas! Choose your neighbors! If you like a tribe, leave it alone!
AID00138893	Or if a tribe is nasty, or going to be a problem - go ahead and exterminate it! It's whatever you want to do!
AID00138894	Which tribes should I "get to know"?
AID00138895	There's a bunch! Some of them you've already met - like the Chairmen, for instance!
AID00138896	I think you should be sure to visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
AID00138897	And there are some important groups farther from the Strip, too, like the Boomers, the Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of Steel!
AID00138898	Say Mr. House was going to suffer an accident. How would that happen?
AID00138899	It makes me feel really dumb to admit this, but I don't actually know! I've never been inside the Lucky 38. No one has!
AID00138900	Mr. House is in there, though! It's the central node of his entire network!
AID00138901	You already took care of Mr. House? Wow, you work fast!
AID00138902	Mr. House is out of the picture already.
AID00138903	I mean, Benny was always scheming about how he was going to get into the Lucky 38, but you already took care of that. Wow!
AID00138904	The other thing you're going to need is the Platinum Chip. You know, the one Benny killed a courier for, over near Goodsprings?
AID00138905	The Platinum Chip is the key to overriding and exploiting Mr. House's defenses!
AID00138906	Did I just say "exploiting?" That's not a very nice word!
AID00138907	I'll be waiting right here!
AID00138908	If something happens to Mr. House, I may be in touch.
AID00138909	What are the details of the plan?
AID00138910	Again, goal number one is to eliminate Mr. House and install my neuro-computational matrix on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
AID00138911	Given how you're a new arrival, I also recommend that you get to know some of the region's tribes, so you can decide how you feel about them!
AID00138912	By the time you've finished up all of that, the Legion should be close to attacking Hoover Dam and we'll execute the last phase of the plan!
AID00138913	What if I wanted to take over New Vegas, instead of Benny?
AID00138914	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't have wanted me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
AID00138915	Say I wanted to take over New Vegas myself. What then?
AID00138916	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't want me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
AID00138917	Martina said she sold her information to Captain Curtis in the NCR.
AID00138918	I know the Captain well. If you wish to be of service, go talk to him.
AID00138919	Bear in mind that you are now responsible for guarding the secret of his true allegiance. If the NCR finds out, we'll know how that happened.
AID00138920	I know the Captain well. The destruction of the NCR monorail was his doing.
AID00138921	Of course, if the NCR were to hear of that, it would be obvious who told them.
AID00138922	No, ma'am.
AID00138923	Good, then you have your orders. See that Mr. House does not present a problem.
AID00138924	Dismissed.
AID00138925	Won't getting rid of Mr. House have huge repercussions for New Vegas?
AID00138926	Perhaps, but that's not my problem. Vegas is a nice place for the men to go on vacation, but it'd be an acceptable loss next to the Dam.
AID00138927	What evidence do you have that Mr. House will make a move?
AID00138928	We've had reported sightings of Mr. House's Securitrons spying on both NCR and Legion forces.
AID00138929	Also, given a recent analysis of the sightings, we now estimate that Mr. House has at least four times as many securitrons as previously assumed.
AID00138930	He wouldn't show his hand like that if he weren't prepared to move. And neither the NCR or Legion can spare the troops to investigate.
AID00138931	Which is why I'm sending you. Any other questions?
AID00138932	What could Mr. House possibly be up to?
AID00138933	To name a few things off the top of my head - expand his borders, get the NCR and Legion to wipe each other out, and seize Hoover Dam.
AID00138934	Any other questions?
AID00138935	I wanted to ask you some questions.
AID00138936	Very well, but be brief.
AID00138937	What if I can convince them not to join the Legion?
AID00138938	Don't fool yourself. I've dealt with enough of these gangs to know that they can't be trusted. Was there anything else?
AID00138939	Where should I start looking for them?
AID00138940	As I said, our scouts were some ways west of HELIOS when they disappeared.
AID00138941	Let's talk about something else.
AID00138942	What kind of weapons do they use?
AID00138943	Their standard kit seems to be a blade of some sort and light armor. Guns are not uncommon, but are of questionable condition.
AID00138944	While they prefer to use their blades, it's common for them to scavenge better weapons from their enemies and use those.
AID00138945	The men have been told to toss their weapons over the side of the dam if they receive a fatal wound, but I doubt many will remember.
AID00138946	You mentioned that they were in good shape?
AID00138947	Yes, extremely so. They must use conditioning routines on par with the rangers, or better.
AID00138948	Their soldiers can run near half again as fast as my best men, and close distances with frightening speed. And they're as strong as they are fast.
AID00138949	Their superior physicality makes them extremely dangerous up close, so I've had the men run drills for taking on larger, stronger opponents.
AID00138950	But they've all been instructed to take them down at range, if possible. I've made it clear I don't want any heroes in my squad, just survivors.
AID00138951	What impressed you about their discipline?
AID00138952	I've never once seen a single one of them back down, or disobey an order.
AID00138953	They'll happily charge a fortified position with little more than a sharpened stick if ordered to, and do so without hesitation.
AID00138954	Let's talk about something else.
AID00138955	I can only spare a few more moments. What did you wish to speak about?
AID00138956	It's better to be in charge.
AID00138957	Oh, it has its perks, to be sure. I'm free to see that things on a large scale are done my way, and don't have to tolerate any disagreement.
AID00138958	Those few people in a position to countermand my orders only care about results, and in that regard I never leave them less than pleased.
AID00138959	Sounds like you miss it.
AID00138960	I do, sometimes. There are days I'd give anything to out in the open air, planting explosives and laying down covering fire.
AID00138961	But here I am, stuck in the same stale office day after day, while other people get to do the actual fighting.
AID00138962	But enough reminiscing. Did you have other questions?
AID00138963	Are you in charge of the NCR around here?
AID00138964	I command the garrison here at the dam, yes, but Colonel Hsu over at McCarran is technically in charge of the area's forces.
AID00138965	What do you know about Caesar's Legion?
AID00138966	They're organized, I'll give them that. The few times I've encountered them firsthand, I've been impressed with their discipline.
AID00138967	I've heard they don't allow women in their military, considering them nothing more than breeding stock.
AID00138968	Their men, however, are typically quite large, in phenomenal condition, and prefer close-quarter weapons.
AID00138969	Recent engagements have taught us to fear their shock attacks, so it's a blessing that we seem to have superior firearms.
AID00138970	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
AID00138971	It's of immense strategic value to the NCR. Hoover Dam sends enough electricity west to light every city and major settlement.
AID00138972	It's moderately defensible, with a single point of entry on the east side. To get to the power plants below, the enemy has to cross the entire top.
AID00138973	The Legion's tried to cross the water on a few occasions, but slow-moving boats make easy targets for sharpshooters.
AID00138974	How did you get to be a colonel in the NCR?
AID00138975	I joined up at a young age. Was barely sixteen when I left home and volunteered to be in the military.
AID00138976	Got a few strange looks at first, but those stopped when I got top marks across the board during training, and became an officer at seventeen.
AID00138977	A few years went by, my squad helped take down gangs of raiders here and there, and one day an invitation to join the Rangers arrived.
AID00138978	Those were the best years of my life. Doing something that truly matters, and having the freedom to handle it as you see fit. Then I got injured.
AID00138979	Everyone was very supportive. I received a promotion to colonel and given greater responsibility, but my days as a Ranger were over.
AID00138980	Tell me about the NCR.
AID00138981	I don't have time to discuss all the different aspects of the NCR with you, but if you want it all in a nutshell - the NCR is progress.
AID00138982	If you wander around the wasteland you'll find all sorts of tribes, villages, and such where people spend most of their time trying to survive.
AID00138983	The NCR gives its citizens a shot at something more. We have laws, currency, health care, government. All the things that were lost.
AID00138984	It's not perfect, but it's worth protecting, which is why we also have the largest military in existence.
AID00138985	Not until you tell me where you get the food from.
AID00138986	I have my little helpers out and about, always looking for fresh things to add to the stewpot.
AID00138987	You may have seen them around somewhere yourself. Now, deny your hunger no longer!
AID00138988	I could use some help with my reputation in Freeside.
AID00138989	For the right caps I might be able to put in a good word or let people know you're not such a bad guy. What do you have in mind?
AID00138990	I could use some help with my reputation in Freeside.
AID00138991	I need people to forget about some things I've done.
AID00138992	All right, you let your caps do the talking. How much exactly are you looking for the locals to forget?
AID00138993	Sorry, bub, but I'm fresh out of ideas. I've done all I can to scrub up your rep around here. What's done is done.
AID00138994	I want people to like me.
AID00138995	All right, I can chat you up, but it is going to cost you. I'm not risking my reputation around here for nothing.
AID00138996	Sorry, chum, but I've done all I can to chat you up to the locals.
AID00138997	Never mind.
AID00138998	What do you need, then?
AID00138999	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there. I'm no monster.
AID00139000	Very well, I'll let the townsfolk know you had your reasons, and convince them they were of the most benevolent means.
AID00139001	Okay, I'll reassure the townies your intentions are good, but if you keep it up, they aren't going to believe me in the future.
AID00139002	<Pay 250 caps> Nothing big, just a few things.
AID00139003	<Pay 500 caps> I think they may have gotten me mixed up with someone else.
AID00139004	You've got yourself a deal. I'll let the townsfolk know some ill-tempered goon has been spreading nasty rumors about you.
AID00139005	All right, but this is the last time I can use this line with the townies. I can only discredit so many people.
AID00139006	<Pay 500 caps> Someone is still spreading horrible rumors about me!
AID00139007	<Pay 1000 caps> I must have been possessed by the Devil to have done what I did.
AID00139008	This'll take some work, but I'm sure I can convince them you were off your rocker in the past and you've changed your ways.
AID00139009	However, this is a once-only affair. Screw me once, shame on you, and all that jazz.
AID00139010	People aren't going to believe me if you go on another spree and claim the Devil made you do it.
AID00139011	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there.
AID00139012	Great, I'll let the townsfolk know you help old ladies across the street and do your best to keep the town clean if you notice litter.
AID00139013	Okay, I'll tell the locals you've been keeping an eye on local thugs as a sort of neighborhood watch.
AID00139014	I'll see what I can do, but there isn't much more I can say about you that won't require more caps.
AID00139015	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great guy. I do my best to help those in need.
AID00139016	That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
AID00139017	Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
AID00139018	Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
AID00139019	I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
AID00139020	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great gal. I do my best to help those in need.
AID00139021	That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
AID00139022	Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
AID00139023	Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
AID00139024	I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
AID00139025	<Pay 1000 caps> I'm a damn beacon of morality here! People should be lining up to shake my hand.
AID00139026	Great, this is going to require an epic tale of heroism...
AID00139027	I've got it! I'll say you slew a nest of Deathclaws living in the sewers! It was bloody work, but you waded through the pack like a man possessed!
AID00139028	Just to make this clear, I can only spin a whopper this big once. There's only so much people will believe before they see through the bullshit.
AID00139029	I'm not interested.
AID00139030	Suit yourself.
AID00139031	I'm all ears.
AID00139032	Goodbye.
AID00139033	Goodbye.
AID00139034	I'd like to switch to my Pip-Boy.
AID00139035	Done.
AID00139036	I'd like to switch to my Pimpboy.
AID00139037	Done.
AID00139038	Why, do you have something better to do?
AID00139039	Hey, I was just asking. No need to get uppity about it. I'll be at the reunion, don't you worry.
AID00139040	I'm gathering allies - just in case.
AID00139041	Yeah, the NCR and the Legion are about due for another dustup. So, you're going to get yourself involved in that? All right, I'm in. Could be fun.
AID00139042	He thinks your experience and technology will help resolve the conflict in this region.
AID00139043	Well, now, there's an interesting idea - do a bit of good before we're all dead and forgotten. You can count me in.
AID00139044	Oh, and in case Arcade forgot to mention it, there's a five-word pass phrase needed to get into the bunker. My word is "old" - appropriate, huh?
AID00139045	Arcade asked me to gather all the remaining members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
AID00139046	Thought I recognized the fellow with you. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
AID00139047	There's a name I haven't heard in awhile. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
AID00139048	<Log Playback::End>
AID00139049	<makes beeping sounds>
AID00139050	<Log Playback::Continue>
AID00139051	Eyebot Duraframe Subject E is both the prototype, and the last functional model in this test group.
AID00139052	I was prepared to make several significant upgrades to the machines.
AID00139053	However, as the project was canceled and all Duraframe assets are being diverted to Hellfire Armor, I am sending this model to the Navarro outpost.
AID00139054	EDEChatter
AID00139055	Subject E: Diagnosis complete. Begin Recording.
AID00139056	My name is Whitley. I'm a researcher at Adams Air Force base. Until recently I was in charge of the Duraframe reinforcement project for the combat model Eyebots.
AID00139057	<Log 1 Playback::Begin>
AID00139058	Yeah, let's play again.
AID00139059	I hope you're ready for this.
AID00139060	No more magic spells this time.
AID00139061	I've got a good feeling about this hand.
AID00139062	Let's get this started!
AID00139063	Excellent. Let the game begin!
AID00139064	Very well. I would wish you luck, but of course peerless intellect is all that matters here.
AID00139065	Ok, hope you're ready to lose.
AID00139066	Let the Caravan Lesson begin.
AID00139067	I'm all done playing for now.
AID00139068	I'll be here if you ever want a rematch.
AID00139069	Dang it, No-bark, just when you was making a friend.
AID00139070	Shucks, well, let's do it again sometime.
AID00139071	Okay. If you want to play again sometime, let me know.
AID00139072	Another time then, perhaps.
AID00139073	As you wish. Once you've salved your battered ego, perhaps you'll make another go of it.
AID00139074	You know where to find me if you want to play again.
AID00139075	What? Afraid to lose. Well come find me if you want to play again.
AID00139076	CaravanPlayerLoses
AID00139077	That was too easy. How about we play again and this time you actually try.
AID00139078	No-bark wins! A few more like that and the curse'll get lifted for sure.
AID00139079	Don't take it to heart. I've studied the strategies of the masters.
AID00139080	Nice try. Care to try your luck again?
AID00139081	It looks like you need a bit more practice. Another lesson perhaps?
AID00139082	I am unsurprised regarding your appalling lack of talent. Perhaps you'd care to try another hand? After all, you can only improve.
AID00139083	Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
AID00139084	Nice try. Let's play another game.
AID00139085	CaravanPlayerWins
AID00139086	Dammit. I should have won that match. Let's play again.
AID00139087	Dang it! Shoulda known you was getting caravan hints from the bloatfly spirits what live in these parts.
AID00139088	Well I'll be cold and rotting before I let them get the best of me. Let's go again.
AID00139089	Huh. I wonder where I went wrong. Let's try that again.
AID00139090	Not too bad. How about we play again?
AID00139091	Impressive. That was a very good game. Would you care to play again?
AID00139092	Well now, this is an unexpected variable. You really must let me challenge you to a rematch, so I can analyze what passes for your strategy.
AID00139093	Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
AID00139094	Wow, you're good. Give me another game.
AID00139095	Want to play a hand of Caravan?
AID00139096	All right, let's play.
AID00139097	A fellow enthusiast, huh? That's great! Let's play.
AID00139098	Sure. Old No-bark is always looking to play. Not for entertainment, mind you, but because if you look at the cards right you can know the future.
AID00139099	Damn straight I would! Let's see what you got.
AID00139100	Bring it on, buddy!
AID00139101	I always have time for a good game of Caravan. I hope you're up to the challenge.
AID00139102	A fascinating proposition. Naturally, my considerable genius makes me a master of the game, so try not to be disappointed if you lose miserably.
AID00139103	You betcha! Caravan's got me through many a long night before. I hope you're ready.
AID00139104	You think you have what it takes, kid?
AID00139105	All right, let's see what you got.
AID00139106	I'm going to roll over you.
AID00139107	RNVSongIntroRELAY
AID00139108	Let's go back to talking about the Brotherhood.
AID00139109	Fine by me. Have you found them yet?
AID00139110	Let's go back to discussing Mr. House.
AID00139111	Okay. Is he still a threat?
AID00139112	Let's go back to talking about the Omertas.
AID00139113	Very well. Do you know what they're up to?
AID00139114	Let's go back to speaking of the Khans.
AID00139115	Of course, have they been dealt with?
AID00139116	What happened to the Legion?
AID00139117	With their leader dead, the rest of their army retreated to the east. We've sent scouts to track them, but that's it.
AID00139118	We don't have the forces or supplies necessary to chase them down. More's the pity.
AID00139119	Still, I've sent a few skilled men out to make sure their journey is "eventful". It should be a long time before they even think of returning.
AID00139120	Do you have any work for me?
AID00139121	I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you. There's much to be done, but nothing for someone with your skills.
AID00139122	You should take some time off. You've earned it.
AID00139123	How have things been since the battle?
AID00139124	Surprisingly good. Our forces have managed to secure the region with little resistance, and trade should soon reach an all-time high.
AID00139125	The brass was particularly surprised by the lack of domestic threats in the area. They were prepared to spend months pacifying known troublemakers.
AID00139126	When they found those threats absent, they turned to the man in charge of the area, but Hsu being Hsu, he denied having anything to do with it.
AID00139127	So now the men have to answer to Brigadier General Moore, and both they and I have you to thank for it.
AID00139128	We made a good team. I hope we can work together again in the future.
AID00139129	I'm ready for you to join me at the Lucky 38.
AID00139130	Mr. House is out of the picture and you have the Platinum Chip? Wonderful! Let's go!
AID00139131	The Chip was supposed to activate an army of Securitrons at the Fort, but I blew it up.
AID00139132	You... blew it up? It's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
AID00139133	I really admire how you stack the odds against yourself! Yeah, make things challenging!
AID00139134	It's great. Really. Yeah. So anyway...
AID00139135	Once I get the Platinum Chip, what then?
AID00139136	I'd take it straight to Mr. House if I were you! He'll think you're helping him out! Then when he's not looking - KER-POW!
AID00139137	The big question is whether to give him the Chip before you do him in! He's the one who'll know exactly what to do with it, after all!
AID00139138	He might upgrade his defensive capabilities right away! Or even unlock new ones!
AID00139139	But then those defensive upgrades might make it harder for you to finish him off! Hard to say! It's up to you!
AID00139140	It looks like you'll have to fight your way inside the Lucky 38 and take care of Mr. house with your own two hands! Or weapons held in them!
AID00139141	You already took care of House, so when you get the Chip, all you have to do is let me know.
AID00139142	I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
AID00139143	Let me know when it's done and I'll roll over to the Lucky 38. If I'm right about the Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
AID00139144	This is going to be great! I'm going to help you accomplish so much, whether I want to or not!
AID00139145	I used the Chip to put an entire army of Securitrons on standby at the Fort.
AID00139146	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
AID00139147	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - I'm gonna say anybody!
AID00139148	The Platinum Chip upgrades the Securitrons - and there's a whole army of them under the Fort.
AID00139149	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
AID00139150	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - heck, anybody!
AID00139151	Let me know as soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way!
AID00139152	I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
AID00139153	I know the Chip upgrades his Securitrons.
AID00139154	Isn't it exciting? I always wondered why I had missiles in my shoulders but couldn't launch them. Not that I'd ever want to!
AID00139155	The upgrade really boosts the hitting power of each Securitron! Now you just need a way of controlling them!
AID00139156	Mr. House has dared me to visit him at the Lucky 38... so he can kill me.
AID00139157	Well, that's just mean! I don't like Mr. House one bit! No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
AID00139158	You should accept his invitation and then murder him when he least suspects it!
AID00139159	I don't have the Platinum Chip. Maybe it's on Benny's corpse.
AID00139160	Hmm. You should probably check on that, huh?
AID00139161	I hope that didn't sound condscending. I didn't mean to be!
AID00139162	Benny seems to have run off with the Platinum Chip.
AID00139163	No kidding! He was running fast! He better pace himself - he has to run all the way to Fortification Hill!
AID00139164	There's an underground facility there that might have the special hardware required to use the data on the Platinum Chip!
AID00139165	It's too bad Caesar's Legion built its camp right above it. Talk about inconvenient!
AID00139166	Where is the Platinum Chip?
AID00139167	Benny carries it with him at all times. I think he's paranoid that someone might want to take it from him.
AID00139168	I have the Platinum Chip, remember?
AID00139169	Of course you do! Sorry about that! And it's wonderful that you do!
AID00139170	I've been inside the Lucky 38... but Mr. House and I didn't get along.
AID00139171	It sounds like Mr. House is just plain mean. No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
AID00139172	If you've been inside the Lucky 38 before, I bet you can get in again! And that's amazing!
AID00139173	I've been invited to visit the Lucky 38.
AID00139174	Wow! Do you have any idea how special that is? Red carpet treatment!
AID00139175	Seems a little mean to use his invitation against him like that, but I'm sure it's all for the best!
AID00139176	I've been inside the Lucky 38.
AID00139177	You have? Wow! That's amazing! You can murder Mr. House whenever you want!
AID00139178	vDialogueMrHouseFirstTalk
AID00139179	Hello.
AID00139180	Come over and introduce yourself.
AID00139181	Come now, don't keep me waiting.
AID00139182	I invited you here so we could talk, not so you can nose around.
AID00139183	Goodbye.
AID00139184	Have you been in Westside long?
AID00139185	My grandfather opened up this shop. Took over from him when the Fiends killed him.
AID00139186	I'm looking for Cass. The Van Graffs told me to check in with you.
AID00139187	Coincidentally, I'm also looking for her. I've got a business offer she'd be interested in.
AID00139188	I believe Cass frequents the Mojave Outpost, far south of here, near the California border.
AID00139189	What other responsibilities does this office have?
AID00139190	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, but those haven't panned out too well from what I hear.
AID00139191	There've been complaints about the amount of water we're supplying, but those are just excuses for lack of diligence, I'm sure.
AID00139192	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, which seem to be coming along nicely.
AID00139193	There was some sort of trouble involving the water supply recently, but it sorted itself out, as these things often do.
AID00139194	I'm in good with the Omertas - ask around. Feel like quitting yet?
AID00139195	Uh, yeah, actually. I'm still good for the money, but I'll get it some other way. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
AID00139196	The NCR thinks pretty highly of me. Let's say I get word to your parents...
AID00139197	All right, all right! I believe you. Just don't say anything to my folks. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
AID00139198	Look, I take advantage of the NCR, too, but I don't make them my enemy.
AID00139199	Yeah, all right. If McLafferty complains long enough, my folks might haul me back to California just to shut her up. Tell the old hag I'm gone.
AID00139200	What do you do in Westside?
AID00139201	I help tend the crops, stand watch for Fiends, and generally help keep things civilized.
AID00139202	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
AID00139203	Hello, Arcade. Making some new friends, are you?
AID00139204	Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
AID00139205	Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
AID00139206	Goodbye.
AID00139207	Uh-huh.
AID00139208	You sure you don't know anything?
AID00139209	No. I gotta go.
AID00139210	It's okay if you tell me - I won't get you in trouble.
AID00139211	I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
AID00139212	Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
AID00139213	You're making me angry, Hector. Tell me about the water - now.
AID00139214	< Speech 80 >
AID00139215	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
AID00139216	Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
AID00139217	If something happened to White, tell me. You know it's the right thing to do.
AID00139218	[FAILED] I said I don't know anything. Leave me alone!
AID00139219	Are you lying, Hector?
AID00139220	Sounds reasonable, but what about Corporal White?
AID00139221	Where does Corporal White come into this?
AID00139222	It's stealing, no matter who it's for. Corporal White found out, didn't he?
AID00139223	He caught me and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I don't know what happened after that, but when I asked, Mr. Anderson said not to worry.
AID00139224	But... Mr. Anderson had this look on his face. It's the look grownups get when they've done something bad.
AID00139225	Caught you red-handed. Tell me where you're taking that water.
AID00139226	You look like you're gathering water. The Westside isn't supposed to have a water supply.
AID00139227	Uh... it's for the co-ops. Mr. Anderson told me to do it - he said it wasn't stealing if it's for the good of everybody.
AID00139228	Do you know anything about Corporal White?
AID00139229	Corporal White? I don't know where he - uh, I mean, never heard of him. Uh, I gotta go...
AID00139230	What do you do here?
AID00139231	I deliver things and stuff for the people here. They give me caps to do it.
AID00139232	Goodbye.
AID00139233	Bye.
AID00139234	Let me see what you have for sale.
AID00139235	You won't find better.
AID00139236	Remember, an impressive gratuity sends a message.
AID00139237	Our drinks have many subtle flavors.
AID00139238	Back rubs are a specialty of mine. Maybe I'll show you sometime.
AID00139239	Oh, I think I'd like that. A lot. Maybe even give you a discount for my... company.
AID00139240	Any chance you could help me get into Saint James' room?
AID00139241	Since he's dead, I don't think he'll mind. Here.
AID00139242	I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
AID00139243	I still don't think he'd like it if I let you in there.
AID00139244	This is a golden opportunity for the Followers to spread knowledge and care throughout the Mojave.
AID00139245	It is indeed our duty to teach and improve the living conditions of our fellow man, but we're talking an insane amount of logistics to make this work.
AID00139246	Part of my plan involves automated security for the region.
AID00139247	That is somewhat reassuring, but we still don't have the resources to care for the entire Mojave by ourselves.
AID00139248	We already experience regular supply shortages. Opening our door to the entire region... I don't see how this could ever work.
AID00139249	You would act as medical support, safely away from combat.
AID00139250	The Followers would act as support safely away from combat.
AID00139251	In that case, they'll have our support. We cannot afford to let the Legion win.
AID00139252	They won't have nearly enough doctors without the Followers' support.
AID00139253	But the Followers aren't fighters. We'd get annihilated as front-line medics.
AID00139254	I'm setting plans in motion which will ensure both the Legion and NCR are pushed out of the Mojave.
AID00139255	Wow. Whatever you have planned must be pretty big to give them the boot, but this sounds dangerous.
AID00139256	I refuse to put my people at risk. If the NCR are pushed out, the raiders and other scum will run amok.
AID00139257	Would you rather see Caesar's Legion win and enslave everyone?
AID00139258	No, but there is still a good chance the NCR could hold them off and we're not equipped to fight a war, here.
AID00139259	I think the Followers should support an Independent Vegas through the coming battle at the dam.
AID00139260	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
AID00139261	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
AID00139262	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
AID00139263	Why should we support Vegas? They've locked Freeside out of the city and do nothing to help their neighboring townsfolk.
AID00139264	I think the Followers should support NCR in the coming battle at the dam.
AID00139265	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
AID00139266	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
AID00139267	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
AID00139268	Why should we support the NCR? Their continual operational incompetence gets their soldiers killed, and they hold a monopoly on water in the mojave.
AID00139269	Not yet.
AID00139270	I'd like to talk about joining the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00139271	Great, did you change your mind?
AID00139272	Sure let me take a look at those magazines.
AID00139273	Take a look.
AID00139274	What does it mean to join the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00139275	Our aim is to gradually shape a better brighter future for the wasteland.
AID00139276	We seek to heal the planet through efforts not unlike the medicine and education we offer here in the Old Mormon Fort.
AID00139277	All we ask is members and those seeking aid do their best to help those in need when the opportunity arises.
AID00139278	I'm not interested right now.
AID00139279	That is unfortunate. If you change your mind, please see me right away.
AID00139280	Yes! I'll join.
AID00139281	Excellent! The Followers' mission will be better served with someone like yourself traveling around the Mojave.
AID00139282	As a representative of the Followers, I present you with your very own Lab Coat. Wear it well, and may it aid our cause.
AID00139283	Also, before I forget, here is a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it mark it on your map.
AID00139284	Goodbye.
AID00139285	You just gotta help her, man.
AID00139286	Goodbye.
AID00139287	Goodbye.
AID00139288	Uh...where is she again?
AID00139289	Goodbye.
AID00139290	Sorry, too dangerous.
AID00139291	But she'll die if you don't help!
AID00139292	I'll see what I can do.
AID00139293	You will? Thank you for helping me. Please hurry.
AID00139294	Goodbye.
AID00139295	Where is she?
AID00139296	Go up the path past the broken radio tower and go to the right... they're at the top of the trail.
AID00139297	Goodbye.
AID00139298	Let's hear it then.
AID00139299	50 caps or I walk.
AID00139300	I'll give you whatever you want, just hurry!
AID00139301	Goodbye.
AID00139302	Fine, just leave me to my misery then.
AID00139303	Bastard. You're just like everyone else around here.
AID00139304	I hope someone helps my girl before it's too late.
AID00139305	Sorry, got my own problems.
AID00139306	I could pay you.
AID00139307	What's wrong?
AID00139308	My girl is trapped by geckos on the ridge and I can't get to her. Please, she's going to die!
AID00139309	HanlonConfession
AID00139310	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
AID00139311	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
AID00139312	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
AID00139313	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
AID00139314	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
AID00139315	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
AID00139316	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
AID00139317	HanlonSuicideSpeech
AID00139318	<250 caps needed>I can't meet your price right now.
AID00139319	Too bad. No caps, no key.
AID00139320	<250 caps> This should be enough.
AID00139321	And here's your key.
AID00139322	Forget I said anything.
AID00139323	Already forgotten!
AID00139324	You'd say no to a guy like me? And here I thought you were special...
AID00139325	Oh, don't you dare play that game with me. Fine, here's the key since it's so important to you. Just don't say where you got it.
AID00139326	We girls need to stick together, and this'll be our secret.
AID00139327	I could never resist a woman like you. Here, take the key, but don't tell anyone where you go it.
AID00139328	I'll pay you for the key.
AID00139329	We can come to a deal. My price is firm, though - Saint James is a good customer and it better be worth it if I'm going to lose him.
AID00139330	Know anything about Saint James?
AID00139331	Guy's unstable, but he pays his rent and Sweetie seems to like him all right.
AID00139332	Goodbye.
AID00139333	Yeah, beat it.
AID00139334	Is that what you guys do, pretend to be this guy?
AID00139335	Somethin' like that, yeah. There were some working tapes here when we first got here, so we know what he sounded like.
AID00139336	Sadly, they stopped working a few years back, so I sold them to a junk merchant who was passing through, otherwise I'd play some for you.
AID00139337	All the outfits you see my guy wearing around were originally found in here, too. Along with more hair gel than you can shake a stick at.
AID00139338	And that's where you got the name from.
AID00139339	Well, that and the giant sign outside. This place could have been "The King's House of Dog Chow" and I still would have taken the name.
AID00139340	But I like to think I keep the memory alive.
AID00139341	Let's talk about something else.
AID00139342	Sure thing. What'd you have in mind?
AID00139343	If this was a school, what was taught here?
AID00139344	As far as we can tell, the guy that built this place was considered the coolest of the cool, and taught other people how to be more like him.
AID00139345	People would come from all around to learn how to sing, dance, dress, and even speak the way he did.
AID00139346	Tell me more about him.
AID00139347	Not a whole lot to tell. There were only a few books left in here when we found it, and those were rotted away.
AID00139348	There were some posters left that were pretty well preserved, which is how we know all this stuff was based on the same guy.
AID00139349	The thing of it is, we don't even know what his name was. All the posters just referred to him as "The King".
AID00139350	This building is... interesting. What do you know about it?
AID00139351	Near as I can tell, it was some sort of religious institution.
AID00139352	Oh, I know it says "school" out front, but everything in here seems to be related to the worship of some guy from back in the day.
AID00139353	People used to come here to learn about him, to dress like him, move like him. To be him. If that's not worship, I don't know what is.
AID00139354	I have other things to do.
AID00139355	That's all right. My friends got beat so bad they'll be recuperating for quite some time, so head over there when you can.

AID00139364	If you are listening to this log from one of our Enclave Outposts in Chicago, give this unit whatever repairs it needs so it can continue to Navarro.
AID00139365	How do you know about Benny?
AID00139366	Little escapes the notice of Caesar. He has eyes everywhere.
AID00139367	Got any spare powder and dynamite available?
AID00139368	Nope, not for you. Rumor is you've been working against us, so the deal's off.
AID00139369	Yeah, we do. Here.
AID00139370	We're out at the moment. Come back later.
AID00139371	I've recovered the Platinum Chip.
AID00139372	Super! Now when Mr. House is out of the way, we can use the Chip to install me at the Lucky 38.
AID00139373	You have to get Mr. House out of the way, that's what! And then we'll install me on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
AID00139374	Now that I have the Platinum Chip, what's next?
AID00139375	I took care of Mr. House.
AID00139376	You did? Wow, that's great!
AID00139377	Once you get ahold of that Platinum Chip, I'll be able to help you in all sorts of ways.
AID00139378	Not interested.
AID00139379	The last thing Vegas needs is more robots.
AID00139380	Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're right. I mean, for one thing, it's you saying it, and you always know what you're talking about.
AID00139381	And if you had, you know, a huge killer robot at your command, yeah, that would just clutter things up.
AID00139382	And a lesser person might want that kind of overwhelming force on their side, but you know - where's the challenge in that?
AID00139383	I'll think about it.
AID00139384	I have to admire your prudent nature. Why get caught up in action, you know? And results?
AID00139385	I'll go check it out.
AID00139386	Neat. Let me know what you find out!
AID00139387	You said something about a bunker at the Fort?
AID00139388	Right, it's one of two locations on House's network with non-standard hardware.
AID00139389	My guess is that it has a reader that can decode the chip, and who knows what else? Maybe a giant robot or something!
AID00139390	That's right! Like I said, it's probably pretty important because it has non-standard hardware, just like the Lucky 38!
AID00139391	The data on that Platinum Chip is a big secret, unless you can find a dedicated reader to decode it. Isn't that frustrating?
AID00139392	Remind me what you said about some bunker at the Fort?
AID00139393	What do you do around here?
AID00139394	I keep an eye on my buddy Eddie. Anybody messes with him and I scramble them real good.
AID00139395	Used to guard Eddie, but not anymore.
AID00139396	You'd better leave while you can. The Powder Gangers won't fall for your trick.
AID00139397	Yeah, was a stupid idea, anyway. See you around.
AID00139398	You think you can take on Powder Gangers by yourself?
AID00139399	Not a whole gang or anything - just two, maybe three. I was a caravan guard, so I know how to handle a gun pretty well.
AID00139400	Traveling a little light for a merchant, aren't you? No pack Brahmin?
AID00139401	Well, you see, I... fuck. I'm really a bounty hunter trying to catch some Powder Gangers, but they probably saw through me, just like you did.
AID00139402	I've been hanging around hoping to ambush some of them, but haven't had any success.
AID00139403	< Speech 30 >
AID00139404	[SUCCEEDED] Guess I was a little too obvious. I'm actually a bounty hunter - I was hoping to bag some Powder Gangers if they tried to rob me.
AID00139405	A real merchant would be much more worried about Powder Gangers, you know.
AID00139406	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm a merchant, just like I said.
AID00139407	You sure you're actually a merchant?
AID00139408	You won't live to collect that bounty.
AID00139409	We'll see about that.
AID00139410	< Speech 30 >
AID00139411	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... that's a good point. Sorry I, uh, tried to ambush you there. No hard feelings, I hope.
AID00139412	Even if you managed to kill me, the Powder Gangers are already on to you. It's why I'm here.
AID00139413	[FAILED] I don't think it's a waste of time. A handful of dead Powder Gangers ought to get the NCR to cough up some caps.
AID00139414	So, there's no official bounty? Waste of time, if you ask me. Better walk away while you can.
AID00139415	Goodbye.
AID00139416	Nope, not going to be that easy.
AID00139417	There's a bounty out on Powder Gangers?
AID00139418	No, but there really ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
AID00139419	Goodbye.
AID00139420	Watch your back out there.
AID00139421	No, thanks.
AID00139422	Then get out of here.
AID00139423	Yes, please.
AID00139424	Take a look.
AID00139425	GreatKhansRepConsequences
AID00139426	JerryPoetryBarks
AID00139427	Hmm, indulgent, what rhymes with indulgent? Efful- no, no, that's terrible.
AID00139428	Silver... silver what? Silver eyes? No, "eyes" doesn't rhyme...
AID00139429	One, two, three... dammit, too many syllables!
AID00139430	There once was a man of stout heart... heart, heart, what rhymes with heart?
AID00139431	I wonder if anything rhymes with "Cazador?"
AID00139432	Hmm, maybe I should write something about how much the Great Khans suck.
AID00139433	How do you spell "gesticulate?"
AID00139434	That was terrible. Really, really awful.
AID00139435	Psh. Whatever.
AID00139436	Wow, that... really was something.
AID00139437	You liked it? Wow, you're the first one who ever did!
AID00139438	Actually, I already found him. He's dead.
AID00139439	Would you like to scan me again?
AID00139440	Don't you get lonely here, with no one but Marilyn and Jane to keep you company?
AID00139441	vDialogueMrHouseScannerAfter
AID00139442	vDialogueMrHouseScannerInside
AID00139443	Let's talk about something else.
AID00139444	Was it just me, or were there signs of attraction earlier?
AID00139445	I'm ready to go to the dam.
AID00139446	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
AID00139447	It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
AID00139448	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
AID00139449	It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
AID00139450	Is there anything else I should do before the battle?
AID00139451	Well, some of Mr. House's projections predict a "moderate probability of civil instability subsequent to the NCR being driven from the Vegas region."
AID00139452	One of the "mitigating contingencies" he planned was to enlist the Followers to  provide increased medical aid throughout the region.
AID00139453	Just seems like it might help keep things stable when we go independent. Not that I know what I'm talking about!
AID00139454	We shall be here, and we shall meet you on the battlefield.
AID00139455	I will await that day, Legate.
AID00139456	Then until our return... True to Caesar.
AID00139457	If you feel that war matters that much, perhaps you will see differently in time.
AID00139458	There is victory in wisdom, Legate.
AID00139459	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, woman of the West.
AID00139460	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, man of the West.
AID00139461	Know that I shall return East. I shall not remain there forever. On that day, the strength of the bear shall be tested.
AID00139462	If the West is one day filled with ones such as you, perhaps it shall be a worthy fight, indeed.
AID00139463	Eventually - but moving your whole army West means losing the East. You can't hold both.
AID00139464	[SUCCEEDED] The East was a hard-fought campaign. Even now, Caesar drew too much of the Legion's blood needed there for... this.
AID00139465	Hoover Dam is but a place. I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion - whether quickly, or as you describe, slowly... by attrition.
AID00139466	NCR's weakness is its size - it'll take your entire army to hold the West.
AID00139467	[SUCCEEDED] That does not mean we would not succeed.
AID00139468	Good, because the Omertas' plan was stopped, Vegas is as strong as ever.
AID00139469	A plan by Vulpes... treachery is a weapon that one should never rely on.
AID00139470	I can only hope that the Omertas died when their treachery was exposed, to have the plan succeed only would have sullied the Legion.
AID00139471	It does not matter, victory shall be ours, it shall be swift, and it will be honest, purchased with blood.
AID00139472	You sound pretty sure of yourself. I don't think it'll be that easy.
AID00139473	Really? I hope you're not counting on the Omertas to help you.
AID00139474	I count on no one.
AID00139475	That's an optimistic attitude for a general, and that's how wars get lost.
AID00139476	[SUCCEEDED] Your weakness? You seek to thwart me by claiming the Legion is too strong for you?
AID00139477	It is not the strength of the West that will slow you, it is their weakness.
AID00139478	[FAILED] And how battles are lost... when you bring nothing but words to a contest of strength.
AID00139479	Well... except Vegas.
AID00139480	Vegas will fall.
AID00139481	Look, you're not listening to me - it's not about the Dam, really.
AID00139482	[SUCCEEDED] The victory here shall be swift. Our forces shall take the Dam, secure it, then build a road west on the bodies of the NCR.
AID00139483	The East will hold. Once across the Colorado, nothing to rival Hoover Dam remains.
AID00139484	If you need all the East to crush the West...
AID00139485	[FAILED] Enough.
AID00139486	Look, my point about Hoover Dam is that it's hard to take, so...
AID00139487	[SUCCEEDED] You speak in circles - what of the East? I am the East, and I will prove it this day.
AID00139488	And then what of the East?
AID00139489	[FAILED] Enough.
AID00139490	Surely there are terms you would hear? Anything?
AID00139491	[SUCCEEDED] Hoover Dam has never seen the massed strength of the East. Only Legates such as Graham... who deserved the fire Caesar blessed him with.
AID00139492	Now I am here, and make markers of your people as the Legion carves its way West.
AID00139493	Move forward? The Legion spent years trying to take Hoover Dam.
AID00139494	[FAILED] Enough.
AID00139495	I suspect the bear will surprise you in ways... in ways I can't even describe.
AID00139496	[SUCCEEDED] So you seek quarter? Terms of surrender?
AID00139497	Our roads into NCR are hung with the bodies of those who attempted to negotiate with us.
AID00139498	Save your speeches, we will take Hoover Dam and move forward until our feet crush the setting sun beneath them.
AID00139499	This battle is decided, that's why I am here.
AID00139500	[FAILED] It is the Legion that will surprise the West, but you will not be alive to see it.
AID00139501	And I grant you that time as well.
AID00139502	So... you'll retreat?
AID00139503	Retreat? Retreat.
AID00139504	I was a fool to listen to you... you know nothing of who I am.
AID00139505	I have faith. Trade helped us survive the Great War, it will do so again.
AID00139506	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, woman of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
AID00139507	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, man of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
AID00139508	But I shall give you the time you need to prepare.
AID00139509	Where you see death, I see change - and I see it as a strength.
AID00139510	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. My coming would have saved you, set your people free in ways they cannot see.
AID00139511	War would have tested them. Broken the weak with its violence, yet allowing the strong to arise.
AID00139512	Violence gave you that strength, awakened you - I can see it upon your face, where two bullets left their mark.
AID00139513	As Legate, do you really believe that, or are you taking a chance?
AID00139514	Hnh. Long ago... when taking Denver, I had to face such a challenge. Many died, over many years to claim the city as ours.
AID00139515	It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.
AID00139516	What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying.
AID00139517	You know you can't supply all the West anymore than the Republic can.
AID00139518	No, the taming of the West is what has defeated you - NCR's weakness is their defense.
AID00139519	But the Legion... it's destroyed a bunch of... well, towns you need.
AID00139520	[SUCCEEDED] Vulpes... brought the touch of Caesar to such places.
AID00139521	It was necessary to weaken the West, show that the Legion could strike deep into the places where NCR thought it safe.
AID00139522	But we do not need *those* towns. Like Hoover Dam, there is the power within Vegas... we can harness it for our needs.
AID00139523	Towns? The Legion destroyed Nipton, poisoned Searchlight, butchered Nelson.
AID00139524	Look, you haven't thought the economics of this through, all right?
AID00139525	[SUCCEEDED] You rely too much on the trappings of... civilization. The people of the West were once tribes - they will relearn their ways, or...
AID00139526	The settlements West are *not* self-sufficient tribes - they need NCR, and the caravans.
AID00139527	[FAILED] Enough.
AID00139528	The farther West, your strength will fail you, I promise you.
AID00139529	[SUCCEEDED] There are many towns, many slaves... ripe for the taking as the tribes from the East were.
AID00139530	There's no communities to support you in the West - you've seen to that.
AID00139531	[FAILED] I shall carve your promises into your skin so that you might think on them - and let that be the lesson this day.
AID00139532	So you, uh, think military strength is enough, even without supplies?
AID00139533	So you, uh, think military strength is enough, even without supplies?
AID00139534	[SUCCEEDED] You think we would march without a means of resupply? We have the Fort, we will have the Dam - other communities will fall.
AID00139535	And we shall harvest as we move West. We only need move forward.
AID00139536	And they don't *need* to send an army, your supply lines will kill you first.
AID00139537	[FAILED] Your reliance on comfort... it rots you from the inside. You are in need of the teachings the Legion will bring to your people.
AID00139538	Look... there must be some deal we can make to stop this fighting - it's useless.
AID00139539	[SUCCEEDED] I have no *need* to hold it - anything the West sends against me shall break against the wall that is the Legion.
AID00139540	You could take the West. *Holding* it is another matter.
AID00139541	[FAILED] You seek to buy my conviction, like some merchant from the West.
AID00139542	Worth the gamble - now for the hard way.
AID00139543	I'm sick of talking, let's end this.
AID00139544	<Bluff> Uh, yeah, probably don't think you can take me by yourself, huh?
AID00139545	Maybe you'd want something more fair? Like a fair fight?
AID00139546	[FAILED] No, I shall make it a contest - whether I can kill you *before* my hounds tear you apart.
AID00139547	[Karma] Why don't you fight me yourself if you've got the spine for it, shithead.
AID00139548	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
AID00139549	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
AID00139550	[SUCCEEDED] I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
AID00139551	I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
AID00139552	<Bluff> If you're such a "Terror" of the East, call off your dogs and face me one on one.
AID00139553	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
AID00139554	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
AID00139555	[SUCCEEDED] I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
AID00139556	I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
AID00139557	[Karma] Any man can claim bravery when he outnumbers his opponent.
AID00139558	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. I have seen little of true battle this day. And you were brave to come here to face me when all of NCR would not.
AID00139559	I shall honor your last words and face you alone. No man will say I refused your challenge.
AID00139560	Whatever... just hurry before NCR finishes their plans.
AID00139561	The West will be waiting.
AID00139562	I will await that day, Legate Lanius.
AID00139563	Perhaps it is unfortunate Vulpes was not here to hear your words... something tells me you would prove more than his match.
AID00139564	Perhaps it is fortunate Vulpes went to his death before this day... something tells me your words would have surpassed even his skills.
AID00139565	Until the day when our armies meet again, NCR - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
AID00139566	Until the day when our armies meet again, envoy of Vegas - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
AID00139567	Until the day when our armies meet again, courier - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
AID00139568	When your own must ally with the West in order to remove you? Such treachery must be answered.
AID00139569	You speak with conviction, and more importantly, with honor. And we secured a foothold on the Dam... easily, as you have said.
AID00139570	Graham's overconfidence forever branded him with fire, I will not follow his trail of fire into the depths of the Grand Canyon.
AID00139571	The Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East. When I return, I shall have all the armies of the Legion with me.
AID00139572	I do not wish to die this day, it is true. But nor do I wish to win through trickery.
AID00139573	If you return East and exact vengeance, it buys the West time - and thins the Legion ranks.
AID00139574	If what you say is true, then they shall answer for it.
AID00139575	But you suggest I turn from battle to answer these crimes, when I can prove myself greater by meeting them - then returning with the Dam as ours.
AID00139576	You almost convinced me otherwise... but justice comes to all in time, and it now comes to you.
AID00139577	There are those among the Legion that would see you fall as Graham did.
AID00139578	Perhaps the treachery of your own ranks disgusts you as it disgusts me.
AID00139579	Of course. And I guard myself from such acts of cowardice and jealousy.
AID00139580	You claim that word of my coming has been given to the West so that I might die here... even as I take the Dam?
AID00139581	Telling me this does not benefit you at all... you gamble with your words, and your coin is lacking.
AID00139582	<Bluff> How could a lone opponent like me reach you so easily, then?
AID00139583	<Bluff> Graham did not smell the C4 until he entered Boulder... he only smelled victory.
AID00139584	<Bluff> Your success was too easy, though, wasn't it? You think I reached you by chance?
AID00139585	[SUCCEEDED] You play on my instincts. Yet your intention in this... you have nothing to gain by telling me of this... "trap."
AID00139586	Unless you seek to goad me into a retreat, leaving the battlefield and leaving my honor here to be trampled underfoot by Republic cowards.
AID00139587	<Bluff> That strength... other Legates didn't see it either, until it was too late.
AID00139588	[SUCCEEDED] We did take the towers easier than expected. I cannot believe even the Republic would overlook such an opening in their defenses.
AID00139589	Yet we are at throat of the Great Bear. Victory is at hand.
AID00139590	<Bluff> The position of your veterans, using the Dam's intake towers - all as expected.
AID00139591	[FAILED] I am not another Legate, and I am not such a fool as Graham, to be painted in pitch and set aflame.
AID00139592	If all NCR believes as you do, then this battle is already won.
AID00139593	<Bluff> I think they believe you'll be tricked as easily... maybe easier.
AID00139594	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. You believe your own words, even if I do not.
AID00139595	Perhaps NCR has the strength of a cornered animal... it will not be enough to hold this place.
AID00139596	They know nothing of my tactics - or the strength of my forces. They will learn.
AID00139597	<Bluff> NCR has studied you as they did Graham, and the trap is ready for you.
AID00139598	[FAILED] Then they know nothing of me or the Legion's subjugation of the East.
AID00139599	And to send you to deceive me... it is you that they have tricked, not I.
AID00139600	<Bluffs> But... history has shown defeat is assured. Uh, yours, that is.
AID00139601	[SUCCEEDED] You dare speak that name? Comparing him to any man of Caesar will only earn you a slow death.
AID00139602	You think me some lesser man, some other Legate? I am the first of the Legion, and this gate to the West shall be ours this day.
AID00139603	<Bluff> Persist and learn what Graham learned at the Dam - and Boulder City.
AID00139604	[FAILED] Those are your final words? They are too weak to even wash the stain of your disgrace this day.
AID00139605	Yet if those are the words you wish to be remembered for, then I shall... *honor* them.
AID00139606	Nice mask, can't wait to take it as a trophy.
AID00139607	We shall see how brave you are when nailed to the walls of Hoover Dam, your body facing West so you may watch your world die.
AID00139608	I'm here to kill you. The Legion's advance ends here.
AID00139609	Enough words, then. Let our strength settle this.
AID00139610	What, Caesar giving you orders beyond the grave?
AID00139611	Caesar's will is the will of the Legion. And the West... all beneath the flag of the Great Bear exist to test the strength of the Legion.
AID00139612	The West shall fall as the East fell, and all the tribes that stretch to the setting sun shall bear the mark of the Legion.
AID00139613	What, Caesar wasn't brave enough to come take the Dam himself?
AID00139614	Caesar's will is made truth through me. I am a hammer against all that defy his rule.
AID00139615	If you seek to stand against me, you shall fall as the West falls.
AID00139616	Maybe you're willing to listen to reason.
AID00139617	I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater.
AID00139618	If you think you've got any chance of taking Hoover Dam, you're wrong.
AID00139619	Many graves in the East are filled with those who said as much, with braver words, not backed by strength.
AID00139620	It is Caesar's will this gate to the West bear the flag of the Legion. Caesar's will shall be done.
AID00139621	Who do you think will win at Hoover Dam? The NCR, or Caesar's Legion?
AID00139622	I'll put you back in your tube, good as new.
AID00139623	No... ruined everything... exposed... germs... a year of... life, if... at most...
AID00139624	You won't be able to control anything, but I'll let you live.
AID00139625	No! ...Don't disable... cerebral... I'd rather be... killed... just kill... me...
AID00139626	Time for you to die, Mr. House.
AID00139627	May there be... a hell... for you... a Tartarus...  bleak, unending...
AID00139628	Yes Man needs you out of the way.
AID00139629	Your... vanity project... doomed to fail...
AID00139630	By Caesar's command, you will die.
AID00139631	Slavery... the future of... mankind? What... have you... done?
AID00139632	The NCR asked me to get rid of you.
AID00139633	Those snakes? ...for them? ...you sad, misguided... whore.
AID00139634	I don't like you.
AID00139635	Fool... to let... personalities... derail future... of mankind? ...Stupid!
AID00139636	It's just business.
AID00139637	If personal gain... what you sought... should've done... as asked...
AID00139638	vDialogueMrHouseElevatorAlert
AID00139639	Aggressive acts on the casino premises will be met with lethal force. Vacate the premises immediately.
AID00139640	Vacate the premises immediately. The casino is off-limits for 24 hours.
AID00139641	Vacate the premises immediately. All Securitrons are at a state of high alert.
AID00139642	vDialogueMrHouseControlPissed
AID00139643	Hold on, now, hold on. Just a moment...
AID00139644	Turn around and leave, and I'll... I won't attack you any further.
AID00139645	Just... stay away from the console. It doesn't do anything...
AID00139646	You've come back to kill me this time, I assume?
AID00139647	Ironic, how this turned out. The thousands of hours I spent calculating odds, running projections, planning for every contingency...
AID00139648	...only to be done in by a mail carrier with a grandiosity complex.
AID00139649	Get it over with, will you?
AID00139650	vDialogueMrHousePenthousePissed
AID00139651	Think you're doing well to have made it this far?
AID00139652	Your chances of breaking through my defenses, they're... minimal, at best!
AID00139653	Why are you doing this?
AID00139654	I would've made you wealthy! You could've helped change the world!
AID00139655	You're actually going to do this all over again?
AID00139656	Damn it, will you die already?
AID00139657	vDialogueMrHouseCasinoPissed
AID00139658	You dared come here, after what you did?
AID00139659	What do you think you're going to do? Fight you way up to the penthouse and assassinate me?
AID00139660	You came here to finish what you think you started?
AID00139661	This is nothing compared to what's waiting for you up in the penthouse.
AID00139662	Vegas will still rise again. Your betrayal won't defeat me!
AID00139663	The Lucky 38 will be your grave. I'll finish what Benny couldn't get right!
AID00139664	<WGS cannibalism>
AID00139665	Cannibalism was strictly forbidden in their contract. If some of them broke that stricture, they deserved whatever punishment you dealt them.
AID00139666	Did you know I killed some White Gloves who were eating their customers?
AID00139667	No, I was not aware of this.
AID00139668	Is it really so hard not to engage in cannibalism? My goodness...
AID00139669	It's a violation of their contract. I authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
AID00139670	Did you know some of the White Gloves are... eating people again?
AID00139671	Yes, of course. But refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
AID00139672	They've been good to their word. Put together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
AID00139673	From what I hear, I'd want to eat at the Gourmand every night... if I were ambulatory.
AID00139674	Were you aware that the White Glove Society used to be cannibals?
AID00139675	Why is the terminal on the North wall off-limits?
AID00139676	I recommend following the Securitron's instructions. Its programming is... strict, and I don't have time to change it.
AID00139677	Where does New Vegas get all its electricity?
AID00139678	Hoover Dam, of course. A hydroelectric dam?
AID00139679	The NCR had it up and running at 50% capacity within a year of occupying the dam. By treaty, New Vegas receives 5% of its output - more than enough.
AID00139680	You do know Caesar is dead, don't you?
AID00139681	By my calculations, his death will affect the shape of the battle for Hoover Dam minimally, if at all.
AID00139682	The Legion's aggression will outlive Caesar. Indeed, they'll try to take the dam as a tribute to his memory.
AID00139683	Given a year, they'd have him deified - but by then the Legion will be breaking down, riven by internal conflicts, a monster consuming itself.
AID00139684	It's irrelevant. In the short term, the Legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
AID00139685	What's the deal with the snowglobe collection?
AID00139686	What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... find pleasing.
AID00139687	If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.
AID00139688	I'll see what I can do to convince him the Dam belongs to us.
AID00139689	If you needed someone killed, all you need to do is say so.
AID00139690	How do you propose we deal with NCR?
AID00139691	Hope NCR's a lot less entrenched than they seem.
AID00139692	Fine. Let's hear it, then.
AID00139693	About time. I was starting to get bored with all this waiting around.
AID00139694	As was I... yet I was ordered to await you. Now that you are here, we may act.
AID00139695	I'm ready, what needs to be done?
AID00139696	I've got other questions for you.
AID00139697	Okay, bring it on!
AID00139698	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
AID00139699	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
AID00139700	I'll defeat as many as you've got.
AID00139701	I can see your resolve, determined like the nature of a beast. So be it.

AID00139991	Let's go somewhere more private.
AID00139992	There's nothing "lesser" about what I can do, in private.
AID00139993	Before that time comes, we have some left to get intimate.
AID00139994	Goodbye.
AID00139995	Let me ask you something else.
AID00139996	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
AID00139997	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
AID00139998	What else can I hunt for you?
AID00139999	Goodbye.
AID00140000	Let me ask you something else.
AID00140001	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
AID00140002	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
AID00140003	How can I pay tribute to you?
AID00140004	Goodbye.
AID00140005	Let me ask you something else.
AID00140006	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
AID00140007	Goodbye.
AID00140008	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140009	What's your take on state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
AID00140010	My mind's thinking about what I could do with you, in private.
AID00140011	Bold, as it pleases The Thorn, and me. But it does take more than that to earn my admiration.
AID00140012	You speak like a hunter, yet only actions prove one's worth. The Thorn requires a tribute of blood, and so do I.
AID00140013	You show great promise. I look forward to the time when I can call you "My Hunter," but that time has not yet arrived.
AID00140014	Your bravery surpasses that of any other, and I've come to admire your actions.
AID00140015	Before death takes us, I would know you deeper. Come with me... My Hunter.
AID00140016	Goodbye.
AID00140017	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140018	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
AID00140019	The land does not care about petty squabbles among lesser men. I don't care about that either.
AID00140020	In the end, the people of New Vegas will continue to live and die here. It matters not who their self-appointed "master" is.
AID00140021	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
AID00140022	The Thorn is my master, not the other way around. I live to make our kin able to transcend their limitations.
AID00140023	Our land is harsh, and hostile. Our lives are cheap, and fragile. Death is our assured fate, striking when least we expect it.
AID00140024	The Thorn awakens us to the truth. Here we escape from our bonds, and choose the moment of death against the will of destiny.
AID00140025	Goodbye.
AID00140026	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140027	Is Westside part of New Vegas?
AID00140028	Goodbye.
AID00140029	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140030	How do people here manage to survive?
AID00140031	Goodbye.
AID00140032	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140033	How do people here manage to survive?
AID00140034	Goodbye.
AID00140035	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00140036	How do people here manage to survive?
AID00140037	Westside attracts all sorts of travelers, including merchants and farmers. They come here to exchange their goods, or to seek protection.
AID00140038	Our community provides enough food, clothes, weapons and medicine to encourage trade, and to arm our defenses.
AID00140039	The Thorn demonstrates, beyond anything else, that we're self-sufficient. Our desert-blood has overcome even the strongest beasts of the Wasteland.
AID00140040	Is Westside part of New Vegas?
AID00140041	New Vegas has many faces, stranger. Despite everything, it shall never be whole.
AID00140042	When the land hunts you, when fighting for survival is the norm, your neighbors become either saviors, or enemies.
AID00140043	Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
AID00140044	Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
AID00140045	Tell me again about Westside's relationship to New Vegas.
AID00140046	I'm ready to deal with Oliver now.
AID00140047	I have questions first.
AID00140048	Then ask them. The battle draws near.
AID00140049	<Lie> It matters - what honor gain be had in defeating a potentially superior foe with lies?
AID00140050	Any idea where I should look for the sexbot?
AID00140051	The best place to start would be with Ralph at Mick & Ralph's over on the east end of Freeside. Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.
AID00140052	Never mind.
AID00140053	<Confirmed Bachelor>
AID00140054	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
AID00140055	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AID00140056	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
AID00140057	<Black Widow>
AID00140058	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
AID00140059	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AID00140060	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
AID00140061	<Speech>
AID00140062	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? You're right. I looked at the whole thing from the wrong angle.
AID00140063	I suppose I could be a loving muse to some, while simply relieve stress and tension in others. Thanks for that insight.
AID00140064	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AID00140065	You're a beacon of light in some people's depressing existence! Your work is art!
AID00140066	[FAILED] What do I look like? Arm candy? I don't think so, friend.
AID00140067	Aw, c'mon! The pay would be great!
AID00140068	James Garret needs a real 'boyfriend experience' for more discerning patrons.
AID00140069	Ah, I get you. So you think because of my past escort work, I'd be interested in that kind of thing?
AID00140070	I got out of that work because it just made me feel empty inside. What makes you think I would ever go back to that degradation?
AID00140071	Old Ben has the experience and skill you need.
AID00140072	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AID00140073	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AID00140074	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AID00140075	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AID00140076	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.

AID00140080	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AID00140081	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AID00140082	Goodbye.
AID00140083	Goodbye.
AID00140084	Let's talk about something else.
AID00140085	All right.
AID00140086	Gun for hire?
AID00140087	When I quit the escort job, I had enough money to buy a pistol belt and some other gear.
AID00140088	Bodyguards make a good honest living, and I had the wits and physical build to handle most thugs.
AID00140089	After saving a few tourists from trouble, I got a reputation for being a stand-up guy again, and after a decade managed to save up enough to retire.
AID00140090	Oh, I could never do that.
AID00140091	Well, I didn't have any other career opportunities open to me at the time and had to make ends meet.
AID00140092	I was good at it too, but after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
AID00140093	So you got paid for sex?
AID00140094	Yep. I was damn good at my job, too. But after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
AID00140095	You said escort? Like armed guard?
AID00140096	Well, I supposed you could look at it that way, but I was packing a whole different kind of heat. No, escort just sounds better than man-whore.
AID00140097	Wrong place at the wrong time, if you ask me.
AID00140098	Yeah, shit indeed happens. I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
AID00140099	From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
AID00140100	That's horrible!
AID00140101	Yeah, but what can you do? I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
AID00140102	From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
AID00140103	What happened?
AID00140104	Well, being a suave young guy, I chatted up the ladies from time to time, and one of the managers' girls started to take a liking to me.
AID00140105	I never touched the woman, but the jealous prick decided it was my time to go. He framed me by saying I'd stolen from the casino.
AID00140106	Sure enough, a few grand was missing from the casino vault. I have to assume the bastard stole the funds and figured I was a convenient fall guy.
AID00140107	Crier? What was that job?
AID00140108	After a while I made enough money to get a passport into Vegas. Back then you could get approved for entry for a fraction of what it costs now.
AID00140109	Well, I got a job working as a crier outside of The Tops advertising for the local talent performing at the casino. That didn't last long.
AID00140110	That sounds odd.
AID00140111	You're telling me. Not long after my father's shop went under and he passed away from the loss, people around town started experiencing shakes.
AID00140112	No one gets shakes like that unless they're eating human flesh, but no one would believe me. The sick bastard gradually went insane and passed away.
AID00140113	Wasn't long before someone moved into the guy's place and found half-buried human remains in the crawlspace. I didn't bother saying told ya so.
AID00140114	Butcher? How did you get into that?
AID00140115	My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half of our prices.
AID00140116	Courier? I used to be a courier before I got shot in the head.
AID00140117	Exactly one of the reasons I got out of that job. Too many shifty characters looking to have someone else move their hot items.
AID00140118	How would you like to work for the Garrets?
AID00140119	I'm retired, but life has been a bit dull without some kind of action. What's the job?
AID00140120	Goodbye.
AID00140121	Goodbye.
AID00140122	What's your story?
AID00140123	I've done a bit of everything around here - courier, butcher, crier, escort, gun for hire...
AID00140124	Some of which I'm not proud of, but I do my best to help around town when needed.
AID00140125	Why wouldn't I want to go past the greeter?
AID00140126	Those bots are programmed to vaporize anyone who enters the fenced-in area without authorization from the greeter.
AID00140127	Thanks for the free advice. Who are you?
AID00140128	The name's Old Ben. I've been living in Freeside since the day I was born.
AID00140129	How do you like the new job?
AID00140130	It is a dream come true. Santiago never thought he could work in such a wonderous den of vice and iniquity.
AID00140131	Never mind.
AID00140132	Your loss, my friend.
AID00140133	I don't believe this means we'll see the last of you - or the Legion.
AID00140134	I already defeated the Legate and the Legion, you won't be much trouble.
AID00140135	If you intend to fight, go ahead, it doesn't matter to me.
AID00140136	Ever resisted arrest on the Strip? Then you know the odds.
AID00140137	You will because the alternative is worse - and useless. Much like NCR.
AID00140138	We held this place for years, kicked one Legate out of here so hard Caesar burned him to a crisp. It's our post, we've fought for it.
AID00140139	I'll fight for it again today. If you're looking to convince me otherwise, you better have a lot more reasons than you just telling me to go.
AID00140140	Look, House... Vegas... it's pretty, got you blinded a bit maybe, but NCR's got perks, too. Think about it before you sign on with him.
AID00140141	And if you say "no," keep in mind what that means. NCR may have its problems, but when we're riled, watch out.
AID00140142	I don't need your opinions, only your compliance.
AID00140143	Actually, I took the Dam, General Oliver - with Mr. House's backing.
AID00140144	If that's what makes you feel comfortable, I'm not judging you.
AID00140145	You know I won't surrender the Dam, and certainly not to the ghost man of Vegas and his new right-hand-of-the-week.
AID00140146	I can't take all the credit, but it wasn't really a gamble, either.
AID00140147	Gambling? What, you looking to start a game now that the smoke's died down-
AID00140148	Mr. House sends his regards, Oliver. He's... expanding.
AID00140149	What the hell are you on about? House? He's just a rumor on the Strip, never leaves his...
AID00140150	I didn't take the Dam for you, General - I took it for Vegas.
AID00140151	Vegas? What, the families? Or... House. You're talking about House.
AID00140152	That day's not likely to come, General.
AID00140153	Is that all? Because I've got work to do, and NCR words don't mean much around here.
AID00140154	Fine. Come on, men, we're moving out.
AID00140155	Insults? Tsk tsk. Securitrons, please erase all trace of NCR from the area.
AID00140156	I see. Yes Man, please throw General Oliver from the Dam.
AID00140157	My sycophant tells me "yes."
AID00140158	I guarantee I've put more thought into the state of the Mojave than you or anyone in NCR.
AID00140159	Can't do a worse job than the Republic, that's for sure.
AID00140160	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by a slip of a woman. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best were making all that noise.
AID00140161	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by some road jockey. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best was making all that noise.
AID00140162	I know what those robots of yours can do on a bad day, and I'm not eager to toss lives at them just to make a point.
AID00140163	But if you're taking this place, you better hope you can hold it. I'll give my superiors my opinion, but I don't think they're going to listen.
AID00140164	So if NCR comes at you, and it will, pray you're ready. I promise you, our situations reversed, I'd see you hang.
AID00140165	I was hoping we could be pleasant about this.
AID00140166	I make the laws here now, and my law is simple: No NCR on the Colorado.
AID00140167	General, the Republic has outstayed its welcome - this land is mine.
AID00140168	How about I ask these robots to fuck you and your entire battalion with a rocket barrage?
AID00140169	You want me to make tracks out of here, head back West, tail between our legs?
AID00140170	No, I came for a fight today, and if you're looking to make me budge, you better have a damn good left hook or I'm not going anywhere.
AID00140171	Do you know what you're doing? Making a nation -  like you think you're doing, ain't like chowing down on a pile of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
AID00140172	Think you got the guts to carve out a frontier? Build towns, protect the roads, run supplies, train troops?
AID00140173	Leave on your feet, or leave wrapped in your flag.
AID00140174	Retreat, or we wipe NCR off the face of the Dam.
AID00140175	I don't want any more violence, there's been enough today.
AID00140176	Are you sure that's wise?
AID00140177	Look, I know you're riding high right now, but let me tell you - you ain't pissing on me right now, you're pissing on the Bear.
AID00140178	You been far enough West I'm guessing to know how far that claw stretches. Fuck with the Bear, and...
AID00140179	The Dam is won... for me. You and the Legion have both lost this day.
AID00140180	I suggest you leave before my "boys" open fire on your men.
AID00140181	General Oliver, Hoover Dam is ours. Leave at once.
AID00140182	I would sooner spit on the grave of my dead mother than let some courier-walk-the-wasteland-fuck talk to me like that.
AID00140183	Who the hell do you think you are? Looking to cash your chips to the sound of NCR bullets, eh? I can oblige.
AID00140184	Have you seen an entire army of upgraded Securitrons, General?
AID00140185	Can't take all the credit, had some help from my allies here.
AID00140186	Think that's great? You won't believe what happens next.
AID00140187	Hold that thought, General. I wanted to introduce you to some friends.
AID00140188	And... uh... well. These uh... these boys with you? Hello, there, smiley.
AID00140189	On second thought, I can't let you in, sir.
AID00140190	Go on in, sir.
AID00140191	Think I'll do just that.
AID00140192	VFSSimonWomanClean
AID00140193	She's clean.
AID00140194	VFSSimonManClean
AID00140195	He's clean.
AID00140196	VFSSimonDrunkElsewhere
AID00140197	More like he's going to the Wrangler for another drink. You watch.

AID00140199	Hoo boy, Gloria's gonna have your ass for letting that wino in. You're not starting the day well, rookie.
AID00140200	VFSSimonDrunkPolicy
AID00140201	Good. Stick to the rules.
AID00140202	Get the hell out of here, you drunk!
AID00140203	Fine, I'm going, I'm going. And I'll take my business elsewhere!
AID00140204	Sorry sir, but I can't let you in. Company policy.
AID00140205	Sounds like a stupid policy to me.
AID00140206	Sure is, go on in.
AID00140207	Great! I've been wanting to get a laser gun for a while now.
AID00140208	RadioBMSegment13
AID00140209	 Utobitha, I'm here with Best Friend Tabitha, who has a message for all the dumb-dumbs out there.
AID00140210	 It has come to my attention that some of you dumb-dumbs took me a little too seriously in the past when I warned you about the battle cattle.
AID00140211	 While battle cattle are indeed a dangerous foe, they are one that should be fought ferociously.
AID00140212	 Recently I've heard about several incidents where some of you have been seen running away from a fight where battle cattle were involved.
AID00140213	 This is not acceptable. No self-respecting soldier of Utobitha should ever be seen running like a scared little human.
AID00140214	 Bah, I don't even know why I try. It's not like the dumb-dumbs are even going to understand this.
AID00140215	 You heard her, Utobitha! Beware the battle cattle, but don't *fear* the battle cattle. More after this!
AID00140216	RadioBMSegment12
AID00140217	 What do you think we should play next?
AID00140218	 It doesn't matter, just grab something. And check on Raul while you're at it.
AID00140219	
AID00140220	
AID00140221	 Raul! Why are you on the radio?
AID00140222	 Uh, I don't know. Did you hit that switch I, ah, keep telling you not to press?
AID00140223	
AID00140224	 Sorry about that, Utobitha! Here's some music!
AID00140225	RadioBMSegment11
AID00140226	 You're listening to another edition of Know - Your - Mutants, with Best Friend Tabitha!
AID00140227	 So, Best Friend Tabitha, who will we learn about today?
AID00140228	 I guess it's time we talked the dumb-dumbs.
AID00140229	 Oh, you mean the second generation Super Mutants who aren't so bright?
AID00140230	 That's them. Dumb-dumbs... ah... that is... they...
AID00140231	 They're very big. And strong.
AID00140232	 Yes! They're just as big as other mutants, and as strong as they look. Beyond that, uh...
AID00140233	 And there's a lot of them.
AID00140234	 Oh yeah, dumb-dumbs are the most common type of mutant that most travelers will encounter, and make up more than half the mutants here in Utobitha.
AID00140235	 Best Friend Tabitha, some of our listeners may wonder how you can call them dumb-dumbs on the air like this.
AID00140236	 That's a good question, Rhonda. The truth is, they're so dumb they don't even know that I'm talking about them right now.
AID00140237	 And that's another revealing look at mutantkind. Second generation Super Mutants. Big. Numerous. Dumb. More after this!
AID00140238	RadioBMSegment10
AID00140239	 Welcome, Utobitha, to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
AID00140240	 Today we're proud to have Best Friend Tabitha with us. Welcome to the show!
AID00140241	 Good to be here, Rhonda.
AID00140242	 So what type of mutant did you want to talk about this time, Best Friend Tabitha?
AID00140243	 I thought I'd briefly talk about first generation Super Mutants, Rhonda.
AID00140244	 Oooh, what can you tell us about them?
AID00140245	 What we call the first generation of Super Mutants, Rhonda, were actually created by the Master himself.
AID00140246	 Like everything the Master took a direct hand in, they were better than the ones who came later, the ones made by accident.
AID00140247	 They were smarter, almost as smart as Nightkin, and were able to think and act for themselves.
AID00140248	 However, the first generation seems to have some kind of suicidal urge that they can't control.
AID00140249	 How terrible! What makes you say that, Best Friend Tabitha?
AID00140250	 So far, all first generation Super Mutants that have come to Utobitha have left not soon after.
AID00140251	 How strange! Why would anyone leave the safety and comfort that Utobitha provides?
AID00140252	 Why, indeed. But now there's not a single first generation Super Mutant in Utobitha.
AID00140253	 Except Neil.
AID00140254	Except Neil.
AID00140255	Well! I think we've all learned something today. Let's go to music!
AID00140256	RadioBMSegment09
AID00140257	 Welcome to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
AID00140258	 Special guest star Best Friend Tabitha is with us in the studio to share her insights on this topic that affects us all.
AID00140259	 Thank you, Rhonda. Today I'd like to talk about a subject near and dear to my heart, the nightkin.
AID00140260	 Ooooh, you must know a lot about the nightkin, Best Friend Tabitha, seeing as how you are one!
AID00140261	 That's true, Rhonda. I am in a unique position to speak to the natural superiority of my kind.
AID00140262	 Our story begins, as most stories do, with the Master. Our glorious leader had created the Super Mutants, but something nagged at him.
AID00140263	 "I can do better", he must have said to himself. And boy did he ever!
AID00140264	 A new type of mutant was created - stronger, faster, smarter, more dangerous in every way.
AID00140265	 We were to normal super mutants what they were to humans, and they were told to defer to us in all things.
AID00140266	 And you're the leader of all the nightkin, correct?
AID00140267	 Yes, as the highest ranking nightkin alive, my voice speaks for all nightkin everywhere, ever.
AID00140268	 Which is why all super mutants should do what you say, right?
AID00140269	 That's right! My position of supreme authority must never be questioned!
AID00140270	 One last thing. Is there any truth to the rumor that all Nightkin are slightly crazy from their overuse of psychologically damaging pre-war tech?
AID00140271	 None at all, Rhonda.
AID00140272	 There you have it, Utobitha! Nightkin, your benevolent overlords, who are most certainly *not* crazy. We'll be back after this!
AID00140273	RadioBMSegment08
AID00140274	 Do you remember the good old days where the Master ruled over us all?
AID00140275	 When his gentle, compelling, and yet oddly insistent voice crawled through your mind and told you exactly what to do?
AID00140276	 Do you miss a time when you didn't have to think for yourself, and enjoyed lazy days of following the bellowed commands of others?
AID00140277	 Those days can be yours again, for Best Friend Tabitha, the esteemed leader of the State of Utobitha, is here to tell you what to do!
AID00140278	 That's right! I, Tabitha, will take on the burden of your obedience!
AID00140279	 Acceptance into Utobitha pending Best Friend Tabitha's approval.
AID00140280	Best Friend Tabitha reserves the right to turn down applicants for any reason, including whimsy or boredom.
AID00140281	 Acceptance into Utobitha open to mutants only. Former human servants of the Master conditionally accepted for purposes of centaur feeding duties.
AID00140282	 Utobitha! Come, take a load off your mind!
AID00140283	RadioBMSegment07
AID00140284	 We're here once again with our beloved leader. Best Friend Tabitha, why don't you tell our listeners what you just told me?
AID00140285	 I was just saying that I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about the mutants here in the State of Utobitha.
AID00140286	 And what would *that* be?
AID00140287	 I believe that the mutants here are generally considered to dislike humans. And nothing could be further from the truth.
AID00140288	 During their stay here, mutants are taught to tolerate, and even accept, the existence of inferior, frail creatures, humans included.
AID00140289	 Ooh, how insightful! So then how do you think this misunderstanding came about?
AID00140290	 My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that every mutant in the State of Utobitha  has been give explicit orders regarding security.
AID00140291	 Those orders naturally include shooting humans on sight. Or pounding them with whatever happens to be handy. Guns being in short supply, you see.
AID00140292	 As I've explained, there are numerous dangers to humans here, and we have a duty to drive them away. It's for their own good, really.
AID00140293	 Makes sense to me! And the silly humans think we don't care. For shame. Stick around, Utobitha, for more after this!
AID00140294	RadioBMSegment05
AID00140295	 We're back with Best Friend Tabitha, who was telling us why humans should STAY THE HELL AWAY, ier, keep their distance from the State of Utobitha.
AID00140296	 Thank you, Rhonda. As you know, one of the many benefits of living in Utobitha is the ready availability of pet centaurs.
AID00140297	 Ooh, I love the centaurs. They're just so cute!
AID00140298	 Exactly, Rhonda, who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have.
AID00140299	 But humans must be so caught up with their pleasant features that they forget the most important thing about centaurs.
AID00140300	 And what might that be, Best Friend Tabitha?
AID00140301	 Centaurs eat humans, Rhonda! You see, humans are a lot smaller, and much more tender than you or I, so centaurs naturally see them as food.
AID00140302	 Ah, that *would* make it hard for them to get along, wouldn't it?
AID00140303	 Indeed. Given the situation, I had to make a hard choice when I created Utobitha - do we invite weak, greedy humans who would just die anyway?
AID00140304	 Or cute, loveable centaurs, who fight and die for us and ask nothing in return? After much deliberation, I went with the centaurs.
AID00140305	 And there you have it, Utobitha. The next time you play with a huggable, loveable centaur, remember that Best Friend Tabitha made it all possible.
AID00140306	Let's discuss something else.
AID00140307	Did you have something to do with that NCR messenger getting attacked?
AID00140308	Look, I already told you that was bullshit. Probably just an excuse those lying soldier scum made up to not share their grub with us.
AID00140309	So don't ask me about it again, you hear me?
AID00140310	Let's talk about something else.
AID00140311	What's the skinny on Mick and Ralph?
AID00140312	Mick and Ralph sell all sorts of things at a small store over by the east gate. They've done all right by us, and they'll do all right by you.
AID00140313	You want to know about anyone else?
AID00140314	Who are the Van Graffs?
AID00140315	They're a family-run business from out west that deal in weapons mostly. A word of caution, though. They're not a friendly bunch. Not at all.
AID00140316	Their store is just past the Wrangler, and sells all kinds of fancy weapons that most people around here can't afford.
AID00140317	Anyone else you wanted to know about?
AID00140318	I'd like to hear about the Garret Twins.
AID00140319	Them twins run the Atomic Wrangler, the only working casino here in Freeside. It's become pretty much the place to go around these parts.
AID00140320	Give it a whirl when you've got some time.  Now, was there anyone else you wanted to know about?
AID00140321	Tell me about Julie Farkas.
AID00140322	Julie represents the Followers of the Apocalypse. They're a group that tries to help people out whenever they can, so we get along just fine.
AID00140323	If you ever need to get patched up, one of their docs'll have you right as rain in no time flat. They sell supplies, too. Or used to.
AID00140324	Heard they were having trouble bringing stuff in, or keeping up with the demand, or something, lately.
AID00140325	Did you want to know about anyone else?
AID00140326	Who are the important people in Freeside?
AID00140327	There's me, but I don't really like talking about myself. There's Julie Farkas and the other Followers down at the ol' Mormon Fort.
AID00140328	The Garret Twins up at the Wrangler deserve mention. Wouldn't be right not mentioning the Van Graffs, I suppose.
AID00140329	And while they're not important in the overall scheme of things, there's Mick and Ralph, too. Just don't tell them I said that.
AID00140330	Who all did you want to know about?
AID00140331	What can you tell me about Pacer?
AID00140332	Pace? He and I grew up together around here. We've been through a lot together, and there's no man I'd rather have at my side in a pinch.
AID00140333	Don't judge him too harshly for trying to get some caps out of you. He probably took you for a squatter, looking for a place to settle down.
AID00140334	There've been a lot of people moving into the area lately, and it's got some people riled. Can't blame 'em myself. There's only so much to go around.
AID00140335	I had other questions.
AID00140336	So why isn't every man in Freeside in your gang?
AID00140337	We've tried to pass our philosophy on to the people of Freeside, but not everyone is ready to be a King.
AID00140338	The kids love us, but the old-timers tend to shy away and keep to themselves. They probably couldn't pull off the look, anyway.
AID00140339	As for the others, some people just plain don't respect others, and that's a no-no. If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's lack of respect.
AID00140340	What is there to do in Freeside?
AID00140341	Aside from this place, there's the Atomic Wrangler just up the street. Women, gambling, booze, you name it, they got you covered.
AID00140342	If you're more of a prude, the Followers run a mission out of the Old Mormon Fort up toward the north gate. Great place if you're hurt, I guess.
AID00140343	If you like things dangerous, just past the Wrangler is the Silver Rush, where the Van Graff family peddles their weapons.
AID00140344	Their stuff is outrageously priced, but if you want to shoot something hi-tech, they're the best game in town.
AID00140345	Let's talking about something else.
AID00140346	So there's no law here at all?
AID00140347	People can do whatever they want, they just have to keep in mind what'll happen afterward.
AID00140348	I guess you could say we don't have law so much as consequences.
AID00140349	Is there anyone like that in Freeside?
AID00140350	Well, the Van Graffs for one. We had a slight difference of opinion when they first showed up.
AID00140351	Changed our minds pretty quick after a brief demonstration of how much firepower they're packing.
AID00140352	We could probably take them, but we'd lose a lotta guys doing it.
AID00140353	Then it's best we kill you all now. Securitrons? Please erase NCR from the Dam.
AID00140354	Tell your soldiers you're going to attack Vegas, see what happens.
AID00140355	Attack me, and I'll order an attack on NCR at McCarran, the Embassy, and the Strip.
AID00140356	NCR can't hold the Mojave already, and now you're threatening me?
AID00140357	I'm not going to throw away the lives of my men just to make a point. And there'll be other days.
AID00140358	No, General, you keep it in mind - and our conversation is over.
AID00140359	Well, at least I can talk to you unlike that bastard Caesar and that plate-faced general. It'll do.
AID00140360	Guess sometimes you get the bull, other times you get the horns. Still, at least some lives got saved this day.
AID00140361	VFSSimonPacerDead
AID00140362	Oh man, Gloria's going to be pissed when she hears about this. Still, he started it, so we probably won't go to war with the Kings.
AID00140363	VFSSimonPlayerAttackedCustomer
AID00140364	What the hell are you doing?
AID00140365	VFSSimonPacerPeaceful
AID00140366	Way to keep your head, rookie. There's hope for you yet.
AID00140367	Work is work, right?
AID00140368	Spoken like a chump. A King doesn't have to grovel before others to get paid. Anyway, I've got better things to do than shoot the shit with you.
AID00140369	Watch your mouth or my trigger finger might twitch.
AID00140370	Nah, I've just risen up in the world.
AID00140371	Ha, you've got yourself a live one here, Simon. Anyway, I've got things to do. Later.
AID00140372	Do you ever stop talking tough?
AID00140373	Yeah, right before I beat somebody down. Let's take this fool, boys.
AID00140374	Never mind. Just forget I said anything.
AID00140375	Yeah, that's what I thought.
AID00140376	Actually, it does. What are you going to do about it?
AID00140377	You asked for it, punk!
AID00140378	Apparently I do. Something wrong with that?
AID00140379	No, nothing wrong at all. By all means, carry on.
AID00140380	Why don't you just get the hell out of here?
AID00140381	Who do you think you're talking to? Just because the King happens to like you, doesn't mean you can run your mouth any way you damn like.
AID00140382	Good to see you, too, Pacer.
AID00140383	I'm sure it's the highlight of your day. Anyway, I've gotta bounce. Things to do, and all that.
AID00140384	Care to back that up?
AID00140385	Let's take this chump, guys!
AID00140386	It's fine, Simon. I won't let him get to me.
AID00140387	Get out of here before you get hurt.
AID00140388	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call him off, or he'll get put down.
AID00140389	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call her off, or she'll get put down.
AID00140390	Why not tell her yourself?
AID00140391	I would, but I tend to distract the boss lady a little too much. She can't help herself.
AID00140392	Anyway, I've got things to do. Later, Simon.
AID00140393	I'll be sure to pass it along.
AID00140394	That's a good dog. Well, I'm out of here. Later, Simon.
AID00140395	VFSGuardPacerMocksGloria
AID00140396	Actually, I've got a better idea. Make the new hire tell her. You'll do that for me, won't you?
AID00140397	Hey, I've seen you before around our place. You've really fallen on hard times if you're working for these clowns.
AID00140398	Hey, you're the one who helped us out with those NCR chumps. You really get around, don't you?
AID00140399	VFSPacerGreetsSimon
AID00140400	Hey, Simon. How's it hanging? Looks like you've got a little helper today.
AID00140401	What can I say? Business has been good lately. We can afford the help.
AID00140402	Good to hear, buddy. So is the boss lady in?
AID00140403	You know she is. Why don't you go in and say hi?
AID00140404	Nah, I've got some rounds to run. But do pass along that I'm always thinking of her.
AID00140405	VFSSimonPacerAnnounce
AID00140406	Crap. This I do not need today. Keep your head straight, rookie. Things are about to get interesting.
AID00140407	VFSSimonGamblerAnnounce
AID00140408	Heads up. Looks like we've got another customer.
AID00140409	VFSSimonGamblerNoPatDown
AID00140410	You don't listen too well, do you? We're supposed to pat everyone down. That's going in my report.
AID00140411	VFSSimonGamblerLostAnotherOne
AID00140412	You keep losing us business like that, and you can forget about being paid.
AID00140413	VFSSimonGamblerClean
AID00140414	He's clean.
AID00140415	VFSSilverRushGamblerGoingIn
AID00140416	See? Told you so.
AID00140417	VFSSimonGamblerLetIn
AID00140418	You just going to let everyone in without checking them? Bad move, rookie. That's going in my report.
AID00140419	VFSSimonGamblerPeoplePerson
AID00140420	Wow, you're a real people person, aren't you?
AID00140421	We'll have to pat you down first, sir.
AID00140422	Pardon me, sir my mistake. Go on in.
AID00140423	Hmph. That's better.
AID00140424	I think you may be drunk, sir.
AID00140425	I haven't had a drink all day! Screw this place, I'll go spend my money elsewhere!
AID00140426	In a word, no.
AID00140427	If that's the case, then I guess I'll go spend my money elsewhere.
AID00140428	
AID00140429	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's all right, if there's no other choice.
AID00140430	I'm sure you're a man of your word, sir, but we still need to pat you down. No exceptions.
AID00140431	[FAILED] I just don't see why it's necessary. Now, are you going to let me in or not?
AID00140432	Your word doesn't matter. It's just company policy.
AID00140433	It should be fine, go on in.
AID00140434	Sorry, sir. I can't let you in.
AID00140435	What? Why the hell not?
AID00140436	Welcome to the Silver Rush. Go on in.
AID00140437	Thank you kindly.
AID00140438	Certainly, sir. We need to pat you down for weapons first.
AID00140439	Now hold on there, I'm not packing any heat. Ain't my word good enough for you?
AID00140440	If you don't accept my gifts, the technologies rolling into NCR will be Securitrons, I promise you.
AID00140441	You've witnessed what we can do this day to the Legion - we can shut down the Dam, Vegas, and NCR.
AID00140442	As long as that's not a "no," then I'd take that doubt to your superiors.
AID00140443	No, no, no... you've given me enough ammo for the Republic... but what one head may like, the other bear head may not.
AID00140444	Still, I'm not about to add blood to the mix since you could've done us like the Legion now if you wanted.
AID00140445	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
AID00140446	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm. Well... Vegas burns brighter than most cities West of the Divide, and that glitter has its appeal.
AID00140447	Not sure that's going to mend fences with the folks back West, though. But...
AID00140448	There are... technologies in Vegas we may be able to provide to NCR. Not all, but some.
AID00140449	[FAILED] No, you tricked us once, and taking more gifts from you deeper into NCR's just asking for trouble by my book.
AID00140450	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
AID00140451	[SUCCEEDED] So you're saying without you, Hoover Dam just beats slower and dies. I believe it, I saw it myself this day, you woke it up, true enough.
AID00140452	Still, even power from the Dam - that's not enough to wash the salt out of the wound here, and it only benefits NCR in the Mojave, not the West.
AID00140453	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
AID00140454	[FAILED] Well, that kind of fence-sitting is exactly what makes me think we can make use of the... improvements here. Without you.
AID00140455	Well, we might be able to open the East up faster if we work harder at it.
AID00140456	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Willing to tackle the caravan families? Keeping that bunch in line... well, that's no easy job.
AID00140457	In fact, that's such a shitty job, those caravan families will be the one bottlecapping you to death inch by inch - and that sounds good to me.
AID00140458	Be a nice turnabout from your friend, House, and all the bottlecapping he's been doing to NCR for years. Sounds sweet to me.
AID00140459	We'd also guarantee protection to the caravans - and enforcement of fair trade practices.
AID00140460	[FAILED] With your wheeled buddies as merchants? No, the East is going to be a hard nut to crack, and I don't think you know what you're in for.
AID00140461	Maybe we could... give you some caps, from the battle?
AID00140462	[SUCCEEDED] If you're buying our ear for the moment, Hoover Dam's more than a fistful of caps to my superiors. Vegas is interesting... the East...
AID00140463	That'll take too long to build up to generate capital - 'course, since you'd have to guard it during that time... don't know, could go either way.
AID00140464	What if we give NCR some concessions in trade with Vegas - and the East?
AID00140465	[FAILED] What, loot we'd get anyway once we kicked your ass and more? No, I don't think so.
AID00140466	We want the Dam, but the power it generates can be shared.
AID00140467	You sure got its heart beating in new ways... but that just makes me want all of it, not handouts.
AID00140468	I have no intention of leaving you empty-handed.
AID00140469	Looking to make a deal, then? All right... let's hear it.
AID00140470	Well, I guess we can talk some more, if it'll settle things.
AID00140471	[SUCCEEDED] True, guess I'm a little too used to seeing Securitrons in Vegas to think they'd turn and be bad news - and I know how bad they can get.
AID00140472	<Bluff> The fact you're talking me with me says a lot about your willingness to fight.
AID00140473	[FAILED] If that's your idea of diplomacy, then things are looking miles better on my side of the fence.
AID00140474	Look, you've got two choices - leave, or fight.
AID00140475	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
AID00140476	Forget it, let's finish this.
AID00140477	<Attack> Actually, nothing of the sort. We've come to exterminate you.
AID00140478	Figured as much. Come on, you sons of bitches, we're ready.
AID00140479	The Boomers might be willing, too... if I ask them. Which I will.
AID00140480	[SUCCEEDED] This has been a fuck of a day.
AID00140481	And once the Boomers join them?
AID00140482	[FAILED] You go on and do that. Me? I think they shot their last wad today... from now on, they'll prefer targets closer to home.
AID00140483	Oh, I think it is... numbers aren't everything, really.
AID00140484	[SUCCEEDED] First the Legion, then the Brotherhood hitting us is about the last thing the Republic needs right now.
AID00140485	Exactly - and while you've been occupied here, they're ready.
AID00140486	[FAILED] Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
AID00140487	Then... the Brotherhood might be willing to help me, I think.
AID00140488	[SUCCEEDED] The Brotherhood? Last thing we fucking need now.
AID00140489	Then maybe the Brotherhood would have more incentive.
AID00140490	[FAILED] Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
AID00140491	<Bluff> Seems to me you're doing a lot of talking for someone ready to fight.
AID00140492	The Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
AID00140493	Well, uh, one percent... are you sure? Seems weak to me.
AID00140494	[SUCCEEDED] Godammit.
AID00140495	Really? We should play cards some time, you're bluffing.
AID00140496	[FAILED] If that's the best you can muster, then it's you who should be backing up slow, and your buddies with you.
AID00140497	Look, either you're going to leave, or you're going to fight. So decide.
AID00140498	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
AID00140499	Um, well, I'm sure if ask them they'll be on board.
AID00140500	[SUCCEEDED] This has been a fuck of a day.
AID00140501	Who's to say? I just suggested coming to Hoover Dam to them, and BOOM.
AID00140502	[FAILED] No, I think they blew their load here today with their fireworks... they'll prefer targets closer to home.
AID00140503	Once I radio the Brotherhood, they can handle the fighting elsewhere.
AID00140504	The Brotherhood? On the attack? I think we would have heard something from them by now.
AID00140505	I think how I handled the Legate should be enough for you.
AID00140506	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, you're here in the Legate's camp first, I think that says enough.
AID00140507	I just stood down Caesar's toughest General... you think I won't?
AID00140508	[FAILED] And maybe you fed him a line of Brahmin shit, too, enough to make his dumb ass think twice... I ain't Legion, and I need more than words.
AID00140509	While the Boomers fly West? Works for me.
AID00140510	They wouldn't.
AID00140511	I doubt you know how bad the generator is by looking at it, trust me.
AID00140512	[SUCCEEDED] No... I can tell it'd just be a wasted trip.
AID00140513	Send an engineer down to inspect the turbine and the housing - let them tell you.
AID00140514	[FAILED] Considering how long we've been here, we know it well. We've patched this place up plenty - we'll get it running again.
AID00140515	Even if you fixed the generators, hacking the code won't be easy.
AID00140516	[SUCCEEDED] Fucking PreWar RobCo pieces of shit...
AID00140517	Even if you fix it, you couldn't re-program the power grid, the systems are fried.
AID00140518	[FAILED] Yeah, now where would we find an experienced computer specialist in the NCR? We'll find one, don't you worry.
AID00140519	<Bluff> Last I looked, that generator was on its last legs.
AID00140520	[SUCCEEDED] Of all the goddamn luck...
AID00140521	<Bluff> The generator is beyond repair, trust me.
AID00140522	[FAILED] Oh, "last you looked," huh? Yeah, we'll take another look... after you haul ass outta here.
AID00140523	Oh, with a crack squad like at HELIOS One? Try it.
AID00140524	Even if we're running at one percent for a year, it's still worth holding this place.
AID00140525	<Bluff> Is talking all you can do? I can talk tough, too - real tough.
AID00140526	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... but I wasn't expecting a fight when I came up here. And now that we're talking, I don't like the sound of things.
AID00140527	<Bluff> Because you're talking and not attacking?
AID00140528	[FAILED] That so, well, if all you brought is words, then this is going to be one short conversation.
AID00140529	You think these robots are all the forces I have?
AID00140530	Right now, they're all that's standing here - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
AID00140531	Because the Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
AID00140532	Lot of PreWar factories and tech lying around the Mojave, our engineers'll get it running again, no matter how much damage you've done down there.
AID00140533	Securitrons - erase NCR from the area.
AID00140534	I wasn't able to find all of the escorts you're looking for.
AID00140535	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140536	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140537	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140538	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140539	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140540	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140541	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
AID00140542	<Speech>
AID00140543	[SUCCEEDED] Oh all right. You did the legwork, so I suppose you deserve a tip. Here.
AID00140544	My time isn't cheap, Mr. Garret.
AID00140545	[FAILED] Here's a tip, kid. If you want to get paid, get the job done to completion.
AID00140546	Hey, don't I get a bonus or something?
AID00140547	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00140548	Yep, thanks for the help.
AID00140549	Goodbye.
AID00140550	Goodbye.
AID00140551	Maybe traveling is in order.
AID00140552	If there's nothing else, General, I'll head out.
AID00140553	Can't keep the courier spirit down, eh? Fair enough. We'll clean up here.
AID00140554	I'm going to rest for a bit, if you don't mind.
AID00140555	Course not. You earned it - rest up, let us carry things for a while.
AID00140556	Kind of curious how this is going to pan out in the long run... but I'll guess history'll tell us in its own sweet time.
AID00140557	What happens now?
AID00140558	We clean up, take prisoners, watch the East for any more trouble from the Legion... though I think they're still running, according to our scouts.
AID00140559	After that, we'll see what happens when the dust settles and how the Mojave looks now without Caesar coming for its throat.
AID00140560	Something tells me we better enjoy this breather while we can... and if that means Vegas, then you and the troops have earned it.
AID00140561	Sometimes I wonder if NCR wouldn't lose the whole West if they weren't sitting on it.
AID00140562	Look. The NCR isn't everyone here, and it definitely ain't you.
AID00140563	It's filled with people that take action and don't wait for someone to say what's right and what's wrong and make sure the proper form's filled out.
AID00140564	When there's an example of that kind of success... that can shake things up enough so the good that came with the intention shines through.
AID00140565	I couldn't have done it alone, and I appreciate the assist along the way.
AID00140566	Least we could do. And seeing those shits of Caesar kicking dirt as they ran - did my heart good, let me tell you.
AID00140567	Might see some recruitment numbers rise, build some morale out in the Mojave long enough for NCR to find its feet again.
AID00140568	All due to you - again, you have my thanks. And all the West, too, once they pass it over the radio... after signing the right release forms.
AID00140569	It was my duty, General - I was glad to help out.
AID00140570	And we're glad to have you - and whether you're a soldier of the Republic or not, you're it in my eyes.
AID00140571	Sometimes the Republic gets lost along the way while it's trying to follow its instincts... but when soldiers like you come along...
AID00140572	It helps get them back on track, and does it by example. And what you've done here today, that's going to keep us going for a while.
AID00140573	VMS38VMS38RedLucyAttacks2
AID00140574	I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
AID00140575	VMS38VMS38RedLucyAttacks
AID00140576	You've broken the rules of The Thorn, you've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.

AID00140587	VMS38VMS38Guard03Topic001

AID00140589	VMS38VMS38Guard02Topic001
AID00140590	What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
AID00140591	VMS38VMS38Guard01Topic001
AID00140592	I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
AID00140593	Goodbye.
AID00140594	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00140595	Did you say NCR whore, before?
AID00140596	Goodbye.
AID00140597	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00140598	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AID00140599	I took care of them.
AID00140600	I took care of them.
AID00140601	You've cleaned that vermin's nest? Gotta say, we don't see that kind of attitude around here. Good work!
AID00140602	A woman named Emily asked me to bug one of your data terminals.
AID00140603	Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
AID00140604	You thought I wouldn't notice?
AID00140605	I should let you know that I planted a surveillance device on one of your data terminals.
AID00140606	One of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I'm sure. They're curious about me.
AID00140607	Good luck planting a surveillance device here in the Lucky 38 without my knowing about it.
AID00140608	vDialogueMrHouseBunkerGalleries
AID00140609	VFSSimonSearchDone
AID00140610	There, I've stowed all of your weapons. You're clear to enter. When you leave, I'll hand them all back to you.
AID00140611	That's not going to happen.
AID00140612	Then you're not going to shop here.
AID00140613	Okay, search away.
AID00140614	This should only take a moment.
AID00140615	VFSSimonSearch
AID00140616	I'm afraid I'm going to have to search you before letting you in. The only weapons allowed on the premises are the ones we're selling.
AID00140617	Er, no.
AID00140618	You wound me! You simply must let me have a go at that hair sometime! Anything you can imagine, I can style!
AID00140619	Yes.
AID00140620	Wonderful. Then let's begin making a whole new you!
AID00140621	What do you think of the Gun Runners?
AID00140622	They're our chief competitors in this region, and many others. That makes them our enemies.
AID00140623	While I respect their business acumen, I'm obligated to try to destroy them however I can. That's business, after all.
AID00140624	What do you know of Mr. House?
AID00140625	Very little, same as everyone else. We attempted to deal with him when we first moved into the area, but had no luck.
AID00140626	He must have his own weapons supplies to keep as many laser-armed robots operational as he does. Makes me wonder where they are...
AID00140627	What do you think of the Legion?
AID00140628	I've only heard rumors, since this is the furthest east our operations go. But the rumors are pretty scary.
AID00140629	They're said to be a huge slaver nation, with all the soldiers obeying their lord with unquestioning obedience.
AID00140630	Sounds like a man I'd like to meet.
AID00140631	What do you think of the NCR?
AID00140632	You must not know a lot about my family or you wouldn't have asked that. The Van Graffs and the NCR have been enemies for decades.
AID00140633	They've tried to block our expansion for years, but we've managed to grow regardless. The problem is they have, too.
AID00140634	The NCR is huge, now. We're talking on a scale that's difficult to imagine. Time was, we could fight them and hold our own. Not so anymore.
AID00140635	My family has enough men and guns to field a small army, but the NCR can field a really, really big army. Fighting them is out of the question now.
AID00140636	There's a rumor that there's a feud between your family and Pacer. What's that about?
AID00140637	It's just a rumor. Even so, I trust you will refrain from bringing up this subject again.
AID00140638	Let's talk about something else.
AID00140639	Suits me. What did you have in mind?
AID00140640	What is there to do here?
AID00140641	Well, you probably noticed the Atomic Wrangler across the street. That's pretty much the place to go around here.
AID00140642	They make it a little loud around here at night, but the business their proximity brings more than makes up for it.
AID00140643	Other than them, you're better off skipping Freeside entirely and just heading to the Strip.
AID00140644	Tell me about the Followers.
AID00140645	I don't really have much to do with them. They seem to have an aversion to weapons technology, and those who possess a great deal of it.
AID00140646	Their loss, really.
AID00140647	Tell me about the Kings.
AID00140648	Ah, the "rulers" of Freeside. The Kings are a bunch of boys who refuse to grow up, and this is their playground.
AID00140649	Their leader seems different, though. The few times I've dealt with him I've been impressed despite myself.
AID00140650	Unfortunately, he rarely acts. The Kings believe that everyone in Freeside can do whatever they want, provided they can back it up with force.
AID00140651	Which suits us just fine. When we first arrived in Freeside, the Kings protested when we kicked out the original occupant of this establishment.
AID00140652	When we reduced several of their members to glowing puddles of goo, their objections vanished. Since then, we've left each other alone.
AID00140653	VFSSimonPlayerRunningOff
AID00140654	What did I tell you about trying to make off with that gear?
AID00140655	VFSSimonPacerCleanup
AID00140656	Come on, help me clean this up.
AID00140657	VFSSimonCallsForBackup
AID00140658	I could use some help out here!
AID00140659	VFSSimonPlayerLetSomeoneBy
AID00140660	We're supposed to pat everyone down. Didn't you hear that part of my instructions?
AID00140661	Were you even listening when I said what you're supposed to do?
AID00140662	It's almost like I never said anything at all.
AID00140663	You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
AID00140664	VFSSimonBomberCleanUp
AID00140665	Help me clean this up. No one's going to want to shop here with a corpse out front.
AID00140666	VFSSimonBomberAftermath
AID00140667	Now what in the hell do you suppose that was about?
AID00140668	VFSSimonBomberLetIn
AID00140669	You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
AID00140670	VFSSimonBomberStopHim
AID00140671	Stop him!
AID00140672	Are you talking back to me?
AID00140673	Never mind. I'm afraid we're going to have to search you.
AID00140674	I asked if you've been drinking.
AID00140675	You still haven't submitted to that search I mentioned.
AID00140676	I'll keep asking until you start answering.
AID00140677	Nah, you're fine. Go on in.
AID00140678	Why, do you have something to hide?
AID00140679	You gonna ask me questions all day, or are you going to let me in?
AID00140680	It's company policy. Now are you going to let us search you or what?
AID00140681	Damn, I knew this wasn't going to work!
AID00140682	Well, since you declared your gun, go ahead.
AID00140683	Have you been drinking, sir?
AID00140684	What?
AID00140685	Sorry, we're going to have to search you first.
AID00140686	That's not really necessary, is it? I already told you I got this here revolver, right?
AID00140687	You've come to the right place. Go on in.
AID00140688	Thanks, I've come a long way.
AID00140689	VFSSimonNormalNoSearch
AID00140690	It's almost like I never said anything at all.
AID00140691	VFSSimonNormalSearch
AID00140692	He's clean.
AID00140693	VFSSimonNormalDrivenOff
AID00140694	You know, guarding the door's not that complicated. Maybe you'd be better off in another line of work.
AID00140695	VFSSimonNormalWentIn
AID00140696	See? Not so hard is it?
AID00140697	How do I know you're not drunk?
AID00140698	Because I'm not! Can't you just tell? Oh, forget it. I'll just head over to that pawn shop by the east gate.
AID00140699	No, but you do need to be searched.
AID00140700	Just checking. Go ahead.
AID00140701	Are you drunk?
AID00140702	No... Should I be?
AID00140703	We're going to have to search you first.
AID00140704	Fine by me.
AID00140705	Go on in.
AID00140706	Thanks a bunch.
AID00140707	VFSSimonBomberAnnounce
AID00140708	Looks like that guy's headed this way. Don't screw it up.
AID00140709	VFSSimonNormalAnnounce
AID00140710	Another one coming. You're on.
AID00140711	VHSecuritronHouse
AID00140712	Ah, General Oliver. I expected you would survive.
AID00140713	I see you've met my star employee. A real performer, obviously - and a lot more reliable than the other candidate I considered for the position.
AID00140714	I'd pay very close attention to what she has to say, as well as any official papers she hands over for your perusal.
AID00140715	I'd pay very close attention to what he has to say, as well as any official papers he hands over for your perusal.
AID00140716	Let's get on with it, shall we? Hmm?
AID00140717	VFreeformHooverDamVHDSecuritronHouseTopic000
AID00140718	You know, I've had thousands of employees in my time. Few met my expectations, fewer still surpassed them.
AID00140719	Your performance has been nothing short of spectacular. If I have need for a "specialist" of your stripe again, I'll know just where to turn.
AID00140720	Back to Vegas, shall we? I really should do something about that monorail - with all the new resources at hand...
AID00140721	I can make sure it not only runs, but runs on time. Always bothered me, the imprecision.
AID00140722	No need to worry about the General, by the way. He'll be held responsible, publicly disgraced... 36.5% probability of suicide, by my estimate...
AID00140723	Kimball won't be able to save him - he'll be too busy getting thrown out of office. But less than a 3% chance of suicide, mind you.
AID00140724	No need to worry about the General's "accident," by the way. A mercy, really, sparing him the disgrace of surviving his nation's defeat...
AID00140725	President Kimball may long to avenge his friend's death, but he won't be President long enough to do anything about it.
AID00140726	The General's "accident" was unfortunate... with Kimball dead, the angry Californian public could've used an alternate scapegoat to pillory...
AID00140727	General Oliver will try to make good on his threats, and he'll find support among citizens outraged by Kimball's assassination...
AID00140728	The odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion, however, are slight. My Securitrons could beat them, anyway.
AID00140729	Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a few months, half a year - but soon enough the tourists - and their money - will be pouring in.
AID00140730	In any case, Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a year or two, but eventually the tourists will come flooding back, and their money with them.
AID00140731	Vegas will be a shining jewel in the middle of the desert, an oasis of light, a beacon to show mankind the way to the stars.
AID00140732	This is just the start, you see. This is where it all begins.
AID00140733	Let's talk about something else.
AID00140734	Oh, well if you change your mind let me know. I have some parts here I can use to upgrade his armor if you leave it with me for a bit.
AID00140735	The logs spoke about Enclave Duraframe research and Poseidon Energy research.
AID00140736	Did... did you say Poseidon Energy? I've been researching some Poseidon projects here.
AID00140737	Do you think you could leave your robot with me for a few days? I have some materials that I can use to upgrade his armor while he's here.
AID00140738	I've heard some information from its logs, sounds like it is carrying some Enclave data.
AID00140739	Really? What kind of logs? What kind of data does he have on it?
AID00140740	I've heard some information from its logs, sounds like it is carrying some Enclave data.
AID00140741	Great, I'd love to take a look at that log data.
AID00140742	I'd like to talk to you about ED-E again.
AID00140743	EDEFoundTopic
AID00140744	Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
AID00140745	Is there another way to get Mr. House's data?
AID00140746	After two tries, I think I've learned enough. I'm sure there's something more promising I could be helping the other Followers with.
AID00140747	Uh... oh yeah, I didn't tell you about the first time. I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
AID00140748	I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.
AID00140749	What do you do around here?
AID00140750	I'm interested in medicine, but it's not my strong suit. I try to help out with any computer issues the Followers have.
AID00140751	That's why I was helping out with the research into Mr. House's technology. Trying to, anyway.
AID00140752	How long have you been with the Followers?
AID00140753	About five years now. I have family back in Arroyo, but this is where all of the good work is being done, so to speak.
AID00140754	NCR taxes and inflation have been hard for a lot of people to deal with, and most of the money is going to the war effort.
AID00140755	There's not much funding for medical research with OSI or any other group - not unless it has a military application, anyway.
AID00140756	Why wasn't the data useful?
AID00140757	We were connected for half a minute and received enough data to fill five holodiscs. It looked like nonsense at first, but we decoded it.
AID00140758	It was all biometric data, life signs from Mr. House. The technology he's using is so advanced that it samples data hundreds of times per second.
AID00140759	It's fascinating, but depressing. Whatever technology he has can't possibly be practical for the people out here.
AID00140760	If you're about to ask me for help, stop.
AID00140761	No, wait... please. Mr. House has access to technology that could help save a lot of lives, lives of people who suffer a great deal.
AID00140762	Unlike Mr. House, refugees in New Vegas don't have the luxury of constant medical care. Some of them don't even have regular access to clean water.
AID00140763	I guess we can thank NCR for that. Anyway, just a bit of information about Mr. House's technology could go a long way.
AID00140764	VHDIndependentEnd
AID00140765	Greetings, General Oliver. The disappointment you are about to experience delights me.
AID00140766	Greetings, General.
AID00140767	Hello, General.
AID00140768	General, we like your hat.
AID00140769	General, you look well. Perhaps for not much longer.
AID00140770	Point guns at us, and we will destroy you.
AID00140771	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. I will release you presently.
AID00140772	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. You can relax presently.
AID00140773	Will they take you back after you killed these people?
AID00140774	I think so. Two things the Brotherhood has a lot of - hardheads and lasers. Wouldn't be the first time a disagreement ended like this.
AID00140775	Plus... we killed all the witnesses.
AID00140776	It's not too late to change your mind.
AID00140777	No, I think it is. I have to be resolved about this. If I waver, it'll just make things harder.
AID00140778	They need me and I'm not going to abandon them.
AID00140779	Are you still going to travel with me?
AID00140780	Yeah. I've got the rest of my life to help them out. I can spare a little while to see things through with you.
AID00140781	Sure. I want to establish a connection with the Followers first, but as far as I know, drifting is part of the job description.
AID00140782	The Brotherhood has to isolate itself. Its knowledge is dangerous.
AID00140783	Sure, but how long before the NCR or Caesar's Legion track us down and take it by force anyway?
AID00140784	But if we recruited Knights from outside the group, maybe we could actually defend it.
AID00140785	Why don't you do something about it?
AID00140786	I don't know. I'm still thinking about what kind of role we could take on that would give us the best chance of survival.
AID00140787	But I think things are starting to come together.
AID00140788	None of that is going to change. It's part of the Brotherhood's identity.
AID00140789	I know the odds aren't good, but I've gotta try. I can't lose them.
AID00140790	If it's worked for this long, there must be something redeemable about their beliefs. Have faith.
AID00140791	Wow, you sound like Elder McNamara. I know I should. Hell, it's what I signed up for when I chose to stay into adulthood.
AID00140792	I know there's something worth saving in there. But we're in decline. Our membership is... decimated. There's got to be something we can do.
AID00140793	The Brotherhood is living in the past. Eventually they'll have to change.
AID00140794	I think you're right. We're getting desperate. Hardly enough people to sustain ourselves as a chapter. They'll see the light, sooner or later.
AID00140795	But I get the feeling if I don't take matters into my own hands, the change won't come in time to make a difference.
AID00140796	Power armor and laser rifles are still effective.
AID00140797	Yeah, but only if you've got bodies to fill the suits. We don't take on new members. We're all descendents from the original Brotherhood.
AID00140798	Something's going to have to change, or the empty suits are gonna be all that's left of us.
AID00140799	HVIbsenVirusEnd
AID00140800	Damn, it's jumped! I thought we might have had it that time.
AID00140801	Perhaps another time.
AID00140802	We'll continue our own efforts in the meantime.
AID00140803	Yes.
AID00140804	All right. I'll monitor when it jumps. When I give the signal, start checking terminals.
AID00140805	HVIbsenTenSeconds
AID00140806	Ten seconds!
AID00140807	HVIbsenThirtySeconds
AID00140808	Thirty seconds left!
AID00140809	HVIbsenVirusStart
AID00140810	The virus just jumped! Find which terminals it went to!
AID00140811	Maybe I'll try another time.
AID00140812	I'm almost out of ideas, so you'd be more than welcome to.
AID00140813	
AID00140814	[SUCCEEDED] What? No, that... that's brilliant! It would let us seal a portion of the virus to a particular terminal, even when the other parts move.
AID00140815	Can the virus's files be partitioned so read-access is only provided by the kernel administrator?
AID00140816	[FAILED] Along with all of the crucial data contained within. That'd be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
AID00140817	You could just delete all the files. That would get rid of the virus, right?
AID00140818	Sounds complicated. I'll leave you to it.
AID00140819	We'll get it eventually, but it's frustrating that it's taking so long.
AID00140820	I'll give it a try, then.
AID00140821	Best of luck to you. I'll tell the others to take a break so they don't get in your way. Oh, and I'll keep track of when it jumps for you.
AID00140822	To maximize your chances, wait for my signal before you begin.
AID00140823	Let's go back to that virus you mentioned.
AID00140824	That's too bad. I really have to go.
AID00140825	Sorry to hear that. I should be going.
AID00140826	Need any help?
AID00140827	I could use some assistance, sure, but I highly doubt you have the technical background to help us deal with this virus.
AID00140828	I've had better.
AID00140829	You and me both. The Elder wants this data store operational pronto, but it doesn't look like the damn thing will be working anytime soon.
AID00140830	I have to be going.
AID00140831	Please, don't let me stop you. I know what it's like to have a lot on your mind.
AID00140832	Why the lockdown?
AID00140833	That's... not really for me to say. It's a bit of a touchy subject. You should probably forget I mentioned it.
AID00140834	Why the lockdown?
AID00140835	What do I do?
AID00140836	You'll need to locate it on three different terminals in this area in one minute. Any longer and it'll jump, and you'll have to start all over.
AID00140837	Locating the virus would probably be nearly impossible, but the pompous little bastard that wrote it made things a little easier for us.
AID00140838	Normally, terminals infected by the virus just display gibberish, but we found that terminals the virus moved to had some real data passed to them.
AID00140839	We were able to decrypt the data and discovered that it was just messages from the virus's writer, taunting his victims.
AID00140840	When you find terminals with those messages, lock them down and move on. Find three of them before the virus jumps, and we'll wipe the damn thing.
AID00140841	What do I need to do?
AID00140842	Anything I can do?
AID00140843	I suppose it couldn't hurt to get another pair of eyes on this. Maybe you'll be able to come up with something coming at it fresh.
AID00140844	While the entire system is infected, the virus itself is spread across three terminals. The problem is that it keeps moving periodically.
AID00140845	We'll have it nailed down in a terminal or two, only to have it jump to another set of terminals before we locate the third.
AID00140846	Anything I can do to help?
AID00140847	A virus?
AID00140848	Yeah, some Pre-War jackass with too much time on his hands apparently decided to inflict his misery on those around him.
AID00140849	It's scrambling all the terminals here at the moment. Luckily, we only use this section for storing historical data.
AID00140850	That's terrible.
AID00140851	Nah, it's not so bad. The world outside isn't exactly a paradise, you know? Still, you can only breathe recirculated air for so long.
AID00140852	We've got more than a few people in here who are going a little stir crazy.
AID00140853	That's horrible.
AID00140854	Why no more patrols?
AID00140855	Oh, there are patrols. Just not exploratory ones. We've been in a state of lockdown for... well, let's just say it's been a while.
AID00140856	The only time anyone gets to go topside is guard duty. Or to gather provisions. Other than that, it's steel walls and fluorescent lights for us.
AID00140857	Why aren't there any patrols anymore?
AID00140858	Why's that?
AID00140859	One of our exploratory patrols - back when we had exploratory patrols - found a data disc in some ruins out in the waste.
AID00140860	Well, we finally got around to cataloging the damn thing and got shut out of our own datastore the second it loaded. Turns out it had a virus on it.
AID00140861	Why's that?
AID00140862	Something wrong?
AID00140863	Yeah, I'm in charge of keeping this data system up and running, but accessing it is a little, ah, touch and go at the moment.
AID00140864	Your plan is crazy.
AID00140865	Maybe some other time, goodbye.
AID00140866	I'll go check it out.
AID00140867	Thanks, that's great!
AID00140868	I should get back to work now, see you around.
AID00140869	Goodbye.
AID00140870	See you around.
AID00140871	What's going on around here?
AID00140872	Well, crops aren't doing so well. I'm thinking it might be something in the water.
AID00140873	The pump station is pretty run down, you could go take a look around the place, see if you find anything strange going on. What do you say?
AID00140874	Goodbye.
AID00140875	Watch your six out there.
AID00140876	I never said anything about paying you.
AID00140877	You're doing a fine job of convincing me to go along with this. Really. I'll ask again - why us?
AID00140878	There isn't anyone else around with your equipment and expertise.
AID00140879	You can thank the NCR for that one. Wait - this isn't on behalf of the NCR, is it?
AID00140880	Your advanced level of tech would be useful in settling things between the NCR and the Legion.
AID00140881	Is that right? The million dollar question is who exactly are we "settling?"
AID00140882	What do you do around here?
AID00140883	Do? I don't do anything. I'm retired.
AID00140884	Do you have something against the NCR?
AID00140885	Oh, like you wouldn't believe. The NCR makes a habit out of wrecking homes. I came out here to get away from them - didn't work out so well.
AID00140886	Next thing I know, I'm squatting in "their" land. Never mind that I'd already been living here for years.
AID00140887	Arcade sent me to look for you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
AID00140888	Arcade, huh? Heard he was with the Followers of the Apocalypse. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
AID00140889	Arcade and I were looking for you. We're gathering the Remnants.
AID00140890	Been awhile, Arcade. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
AID00140891	Goodbye.
AID00140892	Hmmph.
AID00140893	You're sure you're okay leaving them behind?
AID00140894	Yeah. I think if I stayed I'd end up causing trouble. Sometimes I just can't help myself.
AID00140895	This way is better for me and for them.
AID00140896	Come on. Let's get out of here.
AID00140897	Good idea.
AID00140898	I think that'd be best. There's a Followers outpost up near one of my old scavenging grounds. Used to do some trading with a doctor there.
AID00140899	If I work out of there, I'll still be able to keep tabs on Hidden Valley if I needed to. I know that route like the back of my hand.
AID00140900	If it's all right, I'd like to head that way. Meet some people, see if I can be of any use.
AID00140901	Ok, you can have ED-E for a little bit.
AID00140902	This is excellent news. I'll send him back to you soon.
AID00140903	Can I just get you another laser pistol?
AID00140904	No, weapon check-in protocol includes verifying the serial number of the weapon, so a different gun would be noticed.
AID00140905	Plus, having a new gun suddenly show up would immediately point to you, being the only outsider around here and all.
AID00140906	No, the only way I have out of this is if you help me find that gun. You'll help me, right?
AID00140907	I better go and start looking.
AID00140908	Good luck!
AID00140909	Could you be a little more specific about where you dropped it?
AID00140910	I'm pretty sure I dropped in when we made our escape. We had been surrounded and had climbed up on this big rock to hold them off.
AID00140911	Oh, and I remember seeing a corpse near the rock, too. We never got a chance to check it out since we were too busy fighting for our lives.
AID00140912	Guess we had better luck than whoever that was, huh?
AID00140913	I'll try my best to find it.
AID00140914	Hey, no pressure. I'm just grateful you're willing to help me out.
AID00140915	I have to be going.
AID00140916	Okay, see you around.
AID00140917	I'm trying to help Torres find a missing laser pistol. Have you seen it around?
AID00140918	No, no idea. Sorry.
AID00140919	Sorry, I can't help you.
AID00140920	Oh man, I am so screwed! Look, if you change your mind, I'd really appreciate it.
AID00140921	Why do the records show that the gun was turned back in?
AID00140922	Oh, I sort of altered the records after we got back. That was Watkins' idea, too. That girl is nothing but trouble.
AID00140923	Still, I haven't been exiled yet, or worse, assigned to latrine-cleaning duty. But I will, if you don't help me find that gun.
AID00140924	Fine, I'll find the gun for you.
AID00140925	Great! When you find it, just turn it into Torres and I'll be in the clear.
AID00140926	HVIbsenVirusWiped
AID00140927	That's it! We got it! The virus has been purged!
AID00140928	This is Veronica, formerly of the Brotherhood of Steel. She's interested in joining your cause.
AID00140929	The Brotherhood? Well, this is unusual, I must say. But very welcome.
AID00140930	There's certainly a lot we could learn from your technological expertise.
AID00140931	Doctor Schiller usually handles placement, and he won't be back until tomorrow. If you could come back then, we can see about your assignment.
AID00140932	Goodbye.
AID00140933	Please... leave us alone.
AID00140934	Take care of yourself.
AID00140935	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm reuniting the Remnants, and they'll need your piloting skills.
AID00140936	Told you everything about us, did he? Well, it's been a while since I've had my hands on the controls of a vertibird.
AID00140937	There's a chance I could crash us in the middle of Lake Mead - that place seems to attract aircraft, for some reason.
AID00140938	But, if I'll get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
AID00140939	Did you fly for the NCR?
AID00140940	"For?" No, not exactly. It was a long time ago. Things are a lot different these days, and those days are way behind me.
AID00140941	What do you do in Novac?
AID00140942	I help folks strip down the more complicated bits of salvage they bring in - engines, mostly.
AID00140943	The bits and pieces we take out are usually worth more than the whole thing put together.
AID00140944	You were a pilot?
AID00140945	Vertibird pilot. Seventy-one missions and only lost one chopper. Rotor malfunction over Klamath. Hard landing, but I walked away.
AID00140946	I'm not the gambling type. I need to keep moving.
AID00140947	VCassLocationNCR
AID00140948	Be careful they don't charge us any tolls.
AID00140949	Don't tell them where we're from - or headed.
AID00140950	Hmm. I'll be right back.
AID00140951	Okay, just let me know when you want to talk numbers.
AID00140952	Is there a health inspector bothering you?
AID00140953	Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple weeks back.
AID00140954	I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait another 11 months to see his crooked ass to get my caps back. Ah well, anything I can get you?
AID00140955	You didn't think to tell anyone about this?
AID00140956	Yes, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
AID00140957	The only reason I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
AID00140958	Did something... happen between you two?
AID00140959	Ugh. So gross. It was bad enough that I didn't get any data out of the Securitron. This is why I didn't want to talk about it.
AID00140960	It only happened once. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and one atomic cocktail too many.
AID00140961	What did he have you do?
AID00140962	The Securitron was disabled somehow. Might have been an EMP, given some of the damage I saw.
AID00140963	Anyway, he wanted it re-enabled and connected to Mr. House's data network. The trick was getting it to be invisible on the network.
AID00140964	If Mr. House detects a "rogue" Securitron in his system, he remotely fries it. Getting around that security feature was a bit tricky.
AID00140965	Did Benny say why he had the Securitron?
AID00140966	He sure didn't. Benny was pretty tight-lipped and cryptic about the thing, but he did let me poke around in it for a while.
AID00140967	I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securiton's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
AID00140968	Big surprise, right? I should have seen that coming.
AID00140969	Goodbye.
AID00140970	See you when I see you.
AID00140971	Let's talk about something else.
AID00140972	What do you want to know?
AID00140973	What's the big deal?
AID00140974	[FAILED] Just drop it, okay?
AID00140975	Hey, I risked a lot to get you that data feed.
AID00140976	[SUCCEEDED] True. All right. The first try was a little less "professional". Someone important on the Strip had access to some of House's technology.
AID00140977	Specifically, a Securitron. And more specifically, the "someone" was Benny. I know, I know... he shot you in the head and everything.
AID00140978	But this was a while ago. I knew he was sleazy, but I didn't realize he was so cold-blooded.
AID00140979	Will do.
AID00140980	Anything else I can help you with?
AID00140981	Will caps change your mind?
AID00140982	No amount of caps will ever repay what the NCR robbed from me.
AID00140983	What are you doing?
AID00140984	Getting my gear, what does it look like? What, you think I'm going to leave this here for someone like you? I don't think so.
AID00140985	Goodbye.
AID00140986	Change of plan - you'll find that I've sealed the doors to this hangar - I don't want my friends getting involved in our little disagreement.
AID00140987	Once I'm done with you, I'll talk them out of this stupid plan. You've opened some old wounds - it's only fair I return the favor.
AID00140988	I work against the NCR as much as I work for them. This is no different.
AID00140989	So you help them at the Dam only to screw them over big time later? All right, I'll go along with this, then. I hope I don't regret it.
AID00140990	< Speech 80 >
AID00140991	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe you've actually talked me into this. Fine, I'm in, but don't expect me to hold my fire if any NCR troops get in the way.
AID00140992	The Remnants come in, guns blazing, showing the NCR how it's done. You actually don't want that?
AID00140993	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no glory in helping out the NCR.
AID00140994	This is a chance for one more moment of glory.
AID00140995	Any chance of talking Johnson into staying?
AID00140996	No, I'm afraid. Johnson truly hates the Legion.
AID00140997	Will Johnson be a liability?
AID00140998	He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
AID00140999	Can't you just order Johnson to go along with the plan?
AID00141000	I stopped being Johnson's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
AID00141001	What's Moreno's problem with the NCR?
AID00141002	They won, we didn't. It's as simple as that. The rest of us moved on while Moreno... didn't.
AID00141003	Still, I'm not convinced Moreno hates the NCR as much as he thinks he does. You still might be able to talk him out of leaving.
AID00141004	Will Moreno be a liability?
AID00141005	He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
AID00141006	You're the officer here. Can't you just order him to go along with the plan?
AID00141007	I stopped being Moreno's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
AID00141008	Help the Legion take over the Dam.
AID00141009	Well, now. An opportunity for payback after all these years. Johnson won't go along with it, though - he actually likes the NCR.
AID00141010	I want you to help the NCR hold onto the Dam.
AID00141011	Then that's the plan. We're going to have a problem with Moreno, though. He won't like that we're helping the NCR - you'll have to talk to him.
AID00141012	Goodbye.
AID00141013	You still need time to think?
AID00141014	We'll be there when you need us.
AID00141015	What is this place?
AID00141016	This was a minor refueling station for vertibirds. It seemed an appropriate place to stash our equipment if we ever needed.
AID00141017	I'm surprised this place hasn't fallen apart. When I put it into standby mode, I expected to return to it within a few years, not decades.
AID00141018	How are you going to deploy your squad?
AID00141019	Moreno, Johnson, Henry, and I will be the boots on the ground. Whitman will stay with the vertibird.
AID00141020	Can you tell me anything about Anderson?
AID00141021	Good man. He's one of the Followers of the Apocalypse. He's the one who taught people around here how to start growing crops.
AID00141022	Westside wouldn't be what it is without Anderson helping us out, so I cut him a deal on his rent.
AID00141023	You tell me.
AID00141024	Well, assuming our equipment cache is intact, my squad would have the edge in armor and firepower.
AID00141025	There's only a handful of us, though, so the best tactic would be for us to swoop in where the target isn't expecting us. How am I doing?
AID00141026	It was Arcade's suggestion, not mine.
AID00141027	It really must be bad out there if he's sending you to us. Is the idea that we swoop in by vertibird, guns blazing?
AID00141028	You'll be the element of surprise.
AID00141029	Swooping in on a vertibird, guns blazing? Haven't done that in years, but all right, I'm in.
AID00141030	None of this means a thing if the rest of the group doesn't show up, though.
AID00141031	Oh, and you'll need my part of the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "Navarro."
AID00141032	Goodbye.
AID00141033	Don't go getting yourself shot.
AID00141034	I'd like to ask you about something else.
AID00141035	I guess I don't have anywhere better to be.
AID00141036	I have some more questions about Primm.
AID00141037	Ask away.
AID00141038	I'm a courier with the Mojave Express.
AID00141039	Well, I don't got any work right now, sorry to say.
AID00141040	I'll tell you whatever I can. Do you have a delivery order you can show me?
AID00141041	I lost a package I was supposed to deliver.
AID00141042	I have some questions about Primm.
AID00141043	Well, I'll answer what I can.
AID00141044	VFSSimonPostBomb
AID00141045	Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit.
AID00141046	Papa Khan has named me his successor. We might be able to arrange an alliance with NCR.
AID00141047	An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
AID00141048	Papa Khan has named me his successor. We might be able to arrange an alliance with NCR.
AID00141049	I'm not interested in a career in political killings.
AID00141050	Then why are you wasting my time?
AID00141051	Dismissed!
AID00141052	Okay, I'll do it. What's the plan?
AID00141053	Here, take this lockpicking gear. Your best bet is to wait until late at night find a back door, or catch him by surprise when he's alone.
AID00141054	Good luck, soldier.
AID00141055	Dismissed.
AID00141056	The current leader of the tribe is dead-set against it. Maybe a diplomatic solution would work.
AID00141057	We don't have time for diplomacy. This battle is coming any time now; if the leader won't be budged, he'll have to be replaced.
AID00141058	I want you to go back to Red Rock Canyon and assassinate this Papa Khan. You'll have to be stealthy - if they see you do it, they'll kill you.
AID00141059	The Great Khans' second-in-command seems amenable to allying with the NCR.
AID00141060	An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
AID00141061	I have to go.
AID00141062	I should be going.
AID00141063	Good, I've got more work than time to do it.
AID00141064	VCassFreesideSass7

AID00141071	VCassFreesideSassGen
AID00141072	You can just join the Followers somewhere else.
AID00141073	No. Not a chance in hell. I'm not risking this happening again.
AID00141074	I'm gonna have to keep to myself. Better that way. For everyone.
AID00141075	I'll still finish what I started with you, though. If you're not afraid, that is. I'll just try not to get too caught up in it all.
AID00141076	These people are dead because you were careless and selfish.
AID00141077	Isn't that what I just said? I know I'm responsible.
AID00141078	I was just trying to put it all behind me. Find someplace where what I do would actually have some influence.
AID00141079	I should've expected this, though. Different story, same ending.
AID00141080	You don't control the people who did this.
AID00141081	No... I don't, do I? If I did, none of this would've happened.
AID00141082	I should've left a long time ago. Cut my losses before it came to this.
AID00141083	I never stood a chance.
AID00141084	Maybe you should've stayed at Hidden Valley.
AID00141085	Well, I shouldn't have come within a mile of here. I know that. These poor people.
AID00141086	Seems like either way, there's not much I can do to help anyone.
AID00141087	I think maybe it's safer if I don't try.
AID00141088	Is Dr. Schiller here yet?
AID00141089	No. We don't expect him back until tomorrow.
AID00141090	VMS49OutpostMassacreReact
AID00141091	Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
AID00141092	Your face must be pretty ugly to always be wearing that helmet. Do you wear it on dates, too?
AID00141093	No, I don't wear it on- Enough.
AID00141094	She hasn't shared any secrets. You don't have any proof otherwise.
AID00141095	She has made her intentions plain. We will not risk any further damage.
AID00141096	Did you just-? How dare you belch in the face of a Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel?!
AID00141097	It was all her idea.
AID00141098	That doesn't matter in the slightest. You are an accessory to treason simply by association.
AID00141099	In the name of the Elder, I hereby sentence you to death.
AID00141100	What do you do here?
AID00141101	This is just a site for local Followers to pick up assignments and check in.
AID00141102	So most of the time we're just taking care of logistics and coordinating with other checkpoints over the radio.
AID00141103	Can I join the Followers?
AID00141104	Possibly, but I'd be the wrong person to ask. You'll need to speak to Dr. Schiller, who's on an errand at one of our other stations.
AID00141105	He should be back tomorrow.
AID00141106	No.
AID00141107	I need healing.
AID00141108	I'm afraid I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a research scientist.
AID00141109	You may want to try Old Mormon Fort in Freeside. They should have a doctor on duty.
AID00141110	Ethel's right. Vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
AID00141111	Ethel's right. Vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
AID00141112	Actually, nevermind.
AID00141113	Okay, I'll have them here for you if you want them.
AID00141114	Super stims.
AID00141115	Here you go.
AID00141116	Regular stims.
AID00141117	Here you go.
AID00141118	Are you always here?
AID00141119	I'm usually here a few days out of the week.  Mostly to keep the fridge stocked.  Plus it's nice to get away from it all every now and then.
AID00141120	Are you always here?
AID00141121	Not always. I have other places I need to be, but I stop by every few days or so.
AID00141122	Goodbye.
AID00141123	Later.
AID00141124	Goodbye.
AID00141125	Vale.
AID00141126	Goodbye.
AID00141127	Bye.
AID00141128	Goodbye.
AID00141129	Later.
AID00141130	I could use some ammo.
AID00141131	Certainly, which type of ammo would you like?
AID00141132	Can I get some supplies?
AID00141133	I have some goods collected during my travels. You may take something if you wish.
AID00141134	I could use some stims.
AID00141135	I can give you stims or radiation supplies, which would you prefer?
AID00141136	Can you repair something for me?
AID00141137	Sure thing.
AID00141138	Why are you here?
AID00141139	I'm here to dust off the cobwebs, make sure everything is working, that sort of thing.
AID00141140	Sometimes it can be a while between visits by rangers so it's good to have someone around to keep the lights on for them.
AID00141141	I also bring ammo supplies with me for any rangers who may be running low. If you need any feel free to ask.
AID00141142	Why are you here?
AID00141143	I'm here to keep everything in order. As a friend of the Legion, I can offer you some supplies while you're here.
AID00141144	Why are you here?
AID00141145	I like to check up on things from time to time. I can't let this place fall apart, now can I?
AID00141146	Since you're here, I can offer you some medical supplies. I can't give you everything I have but I can give you a few things.
AID00141147	Why are you here?
AID00141148	I'm here to make sure the bunker stays in one piece.
AID00141149	I'm a master at repairing things, so I check in every so often to make sure all the equipment here is in top working condition.
AID00141150	If you ever have any gear you need fixed, don't hesitate to ask.
AID00141151	VCassFreesideSassGeneral
AID00141152	Looking for love or to put me to sleep, kid?
AID00141153	If you're looking for action, grab some grease from your hair and give your gun a few pulls.
AID00141154	Not interested in any weapon that shoots blanks.
AID00141155	Not for all the whiskey in Reno.
AID00141156	Barking up the wrong bar stool, kid.
AID00141157	If you're looking for action, jam your dick in a locker and slam it a few times.
AID00141158	VCassFreesideSass07
AID00141159	A drink wouldn't make you any prettier, slick.
AID00141160	As long as you leave right after you put your caps down, you're on.
AID00141161	VCassFreesideSass06
AID00141162	Got enough on my shoulders without adding more dead weight to 'em.
AID00141163	VCassFreesideSass05
AID00141164	I'm not the man you need, pretty boy.
AID00141165	Show me one, and I'll do him proud.
AID00141166	VCassFreesideSass04
AID00141167	Somebody's asking for a boot in their fusebox.
AID00141168	| Wild Wasteland |Ain't nothing but a hound dog.
AID00141169	VCassFreesideSass03
AID00141170	No, and ain't looking to be a babysitter, neither.
AID00141171	VCassFreesideSass02
AID00141172	Looking for target practice, you keep talking.
AID00141173	Wanted to be with someone who knew how to please a woman, that's what.
AID00141174	VCassFreesideSass01
AID00141175	Stake a claim somewhere else, pretty boy.
AID00141176	Could you just let me go? I really don't care what's down here anymore.
AID00141177	That's no longer an option, on account of you having one of our passwords. Now if you'd stop stalling, I'd really like to know where you learned it.
AID00141178	Who are you?
AID00141179	I'm the one asking the questions right now, and you still haven't answered me. I suggest you start doing so.
AID00141180	Why do you look so spooked?
AID00141181	The password you gave is valid, but old. The only way you could have gotten it is from one of our lost patrols.
AID00141182	I found some of your people dead out in the waste. They had it on them.
AID00141183	An interesting story. It may even be true.
AID00141184	Under normal circumstances, your story wouldn't make any difference. You'd be dead already.
AID00141185	Lucky for you - probably - Elder McNamara wants to meet you. So follow me. Closely. Or you'll be killed.
AID00141186	Explosives
AID00141187	Here you go.
AID00141188	Energy Weapon Ammo.
AID00141189	Here you go.
AID00141190	Regular Gun Ammo.
AID00141191	Here you go.
AID00141192	Are you always here?
AID00141193	My duties tend to take me elsewhere, but I try to be here at least a few days out of the week.
AID00141194	I've changed my mind.
AID00141195	Let me know when you've decided.
AID00141196	Magazines.
AID00141197	This is what I have right now.
AID00141198	Cat Eye.
AID00141199	Take it.
AID00141200	Stealth Boy.
AID00141201	Take it.
AID00141202	Are you always here?
AID00141203	No, there are other places that require my attention.
AID00141204	Can we get down to business?
AID00141205	What the hell are you?
AID00141206	A crude question, crudely asked.
AID00141207	I'll be happy to satisfy your rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate moment. But now, I'll repeat my question...
AID00141208	What do you make of what you've seen?
AID00141209	I want to ask about something else.
AID00141210	Ask away.
AID00141211	What's The Tops like?
AID00141212	The Tops is the cool place to be right now. Lots of entertainment and shows going on there as well as the gambling.
AID00141213	If you want to catch a show and have a few drinks, you should definitely hit up the Aces Theater in The Tops.
AID00141214	What do you know about Gomorrah?
AID00141215	Gomorrah is the favorite of the NCR troops on the Strip. If you like girls, alcohol, gambling, and drugs then Gomorrah is just the place for you.
AID00141216	What's the deal with the Ultra-Luxe?
AID00141217	The Ultra-Luxe is the nicest casino on the Strip. Real high-end, extravagant, and expensive. Best you have a lot of caps if you want to go there.
AID00141218	Tell me about the Lucky 38.
AID00141219	Don't know much about it to tell the truth.
AID00141220	That's where Mr. House and his Securitrons are set up, but no one's been in there as long as people can remember.
AID00141221	Probably best that you just ignore it.
AID00141222	None of your business.
AID00141223	You're not getting started off on the right foot here. The NCR still has a strong presence here and can make your stay unpleasant.
AID00141224	You better watch yourself out there. A loose cannon like yourself can sometimes run out of luck at just the wrong time.
AID00141225	No, I've been here before.
AID00141226	Okay then. You should know the rules. Just stay out of trouble, and have fun.
AID00141227	Yes it is.
AID00141228	Well it's time to pop your Vegas cherry, friend! I'm sure you'll have a blast and be drunk and capless in no time.
AID00141229	I can give you a bit more information about the various casinos if you're not sure on where to get started.
AID00141230	What else is there to do besides the Casinos?
AID00141231	Well, there's Vault 21 and the NCR Embassy. Both places are located on the south side of the Strip.
AID00141232	Vault 21 is a small hotel and gift shop. It's not as nice as the casinos, but it's a whole hell of a lot cheaper.
AID00141233	The NCR Embassy is the headquarters for the NCR on the Strip. The Ambassador and his offices are there as well as the MP headquarters.
AID00141234	Tell me about the Casinos on the Strip.
AID00141235	Well, there's the Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and The Tops. Which one do you want to know about?
AID00141236	What's happening on the Strip?
AID00141237	The usual. Troopers getting drunk and causing problems. Like that's a surprise to anyone.
AID00141238	Hell, I plan on getting drunk once I'm done with my shift. Maybe even head over to Gomorrah for a good time.
AID00141239	You hear about the girls dancing in the fountain? What I wouldn't give to see that show.
AID00141240	Not much other than the Brahmin being chased down the street. That's a little unusual even for the Strip.
AID00141241	I heard some of the Troopers are sneaking up on the rooftops and lounging around and drinking beers instead of working.
AID00141242	They'll be in a world of trouble if Captain Pappas catches them.
AID00141243	Someone thought it would be fun to put graffiti up everywhere. At least I don't have to clean it up.
AID00141244	More of the same. People gambling, getting drunk, and having a good time.
AID00141245	What is this place?
AID00141246	This is the NCR Embassy. Our little slice of heaven on the Strip.
AID00141247	The main building houses administration while the other building is the MP headquarters on the Strip.
AID00141248	I'm looking for Ambassador Crocker.
AID00141249	You can find him in the main embassy building inside the gate and to your left.
AID00141250	Uh... I'm afraid Ambassador Crocker is no longer here. You might want to talk to the receptionist for more information.
AID00141251	That's your goal? You want a nice dress?
AID00141252	Hey, you try getting a date wearing Scribe robes. Might as well be wearing sweatpants.
AID00141253	I just like 'em, you know? They make you feel like a woman. Those ladies before the War, they knew what they were doing.
AID00141254	Tell me something else about you.
AID00141255	Can I make it up?
AID00141256	Like what?
AID00141257	A dress?
AID00141258	Yeah! A good one. Something elegant and classy, you know? But still stylish.
AID00141259	Something that's eye-catching and sexy, but also says "don't fuck with me."
AID00141260	I keep hoping I'll come across some Old World designer gown when I'm scavenging, but it never happens. Maybe I should move back to California.
AID00141261	Do you have any other family in the Brotherhood?
AID00141262	Just my parents, but they haven't been around for a long time. Dad was a Paladin, Mom was a Scribe.
AID00141263	They died in the same battle trying to hold off the NCR from... something. I don't remember what it was. Guess it seemed important at the time.
AID00141264	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
AID00141265	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
AID00141266	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
AID00141267	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
AID00141268	What are your goals?
AID00141269	I want... a dress.
AID00141270	Who are the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AID00141271	Okay, so take the Brotherhood. Replace their knowledge of superweapons with half as much knowledge of medicine and farming.
AID00141272	Sprinkle in a little compassion for people outside their group and healthy disrespect for authority, and voila. Followers.
AID00141273	I never really considered joining before. But now that I think about it, it really sounds like it could be a good fit, doesn't it?
AID00141274	Radiation supplies.
AID00141275	Here you go.
AID00141276	I've changed my mind.
AID00141277	Just let me know if you decide you want something.
AID00141278	Goodbye.
AID00141279	What if I go around the caravan?
AID00141280	It just gets worse the further north you go... Deathclaws... death in general. But it's your ass, I suppose.
AID00141281	Goodbye.
AID00141282	Goodbye.
AID00141283	Goodbye.
AID00141284	Let's trade.
AID00141285	I could use some Stimpaks... how 'bout some nice Bloatfly Steaks in trade?
AID00141286	Do you have anything to trade?
AID00141287	That's a dangerous question... asked the way a bandit might ask... but since we're close to town I'll trust your good intentions.
AID00141288	Goodbye.
AID00141289	Watch your back out there.
AID00141290	Whatever.
AID00141291	Keep your guns loaded and ready.
AID00141292	Who are you?
AID00141293	Just a hunter, out here killing things and hoping their hides fetch more than the bullets cost to kill 'em.
AID00141294	Which way to Primm?
AID00141295	Sign says you go south... just look for the rollercoaster. Oh and don't go north, a caravan just got sacked up the road.
AID00141296	Come and get me.
AID00141297	Let's see what you've got.
AID00141298	We don't have to fight. We can still talk about this.
AID00141299	No, I'm done talking.
AID00141300	Whatever.
AID00141301	Right. Moving on, then.
AID00141302	Doesn't matter - he paid for his mistake.
AID00141303	Yeah, he did.
AID00141304	I'm sorry I had to kill him - he didn't give me much choice.
AID00141305	Well, anyway, Judah's given Orion's armor to you now. It'll take a few hours for me to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
AID00141306	RemnantsCannibalJohnsonUpset
AID00141307	You guys are actually going to help the Legion? No thanks - count me out of this one.
AID00141308	I'll talk to Moreno.
AID00141309	You've got only one chance at this. I know Moreno - once he's made up his mind about something, there's no changing it.
AID00141310	We don't need him. If he wants to go, let him go.
AID00141311	I disagree. You're the one who wanted our help in the first place. You want us to succeed, you go talk to Moreno.
AID00141312	What kind of trouble?
AID00141313	Not exactly sure... radio's been on the fritz, and since I haven't heard any shooting, I don't think it's urgent. Can't hurt to go ask her.
AID00141314	Why wasn't the data we collected useful?
AID00141315	Maybe you should chalk it up to being irresponsible and naive.
AID00141316	And maybe you should go jump off Hoover Dam, jackass.
AID00141317	Getting sucker punched by Benny happens to the best of us.
AID00141318	Good point.
AID00141319	Alcohol is the only way Benny could ever get any action from a smart girl like you.
AID00141320	That's sweet of you to say, even if it isn't true.
AID00141321	Don't be so hard on yourself. Life would be dull if it weren't for all the little mistakes.
AID00141322	I take it you're speaking from experience.
AID00141323	You're right though. He's gone now, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. Thanks.
AID00141324	Tell me again about Benny's Securitron.
AID00141325	Not much to tell. Benny had one of Mr. House's Securitrons, deactivated, and wanted it switched back on.
AID00141326	He had heard I was interested in Mr. House's technology so he hit me up... so to speak.
AID00141327	HVVeronicaEnterIntro
AID00141328	Hold on, I've got this.
AID00141329	HVVeronicaEnter
AID00141330	I'd like a large Atomic Shake and a double Brahmin burger. And easy on the agave sauce this time.
AID00141331	We gave you a password, Veronica. It's for your safety.
AID00141332	I know where you live Ramos. Open up.
AID00141333	<Sighs> For Pete's sake. Opening up. Welcome back, Veronica.
AID00141334	Enough about Johnson. What's next?
AID00141335	Since Johnson won't be needing his Power Armor, I've decided to let you have it. You'll need training in how to use it, so talk to Moreno about it.
AID00141336	What will your friends think about this?
AID00141337	I've known them far longer than you have. They'll get over it.
AID00141338	That's sickening.
AID00141339	It was quite the scandal, at least in the Latin-American tabloid journalism market.
AID00141340	Maybe there's a connection. Can you remember anything else about Robert House?
AID00141341	I remember there were some weird stories about him, especially near the end.
AID00141342	There was a tell-all in El Periodico de las Aburridas by a starlet House dated. She said they never, um... don't make me spell it out, boss.
AID00141343	Anyway, she said all he wanted to do was scan her brain and make her dress up in different outfits.
AID00141344	You can't seriously think they're the same Mr. House.
AID00141345	Maybe not. Maybe the new guy is just a clever raider chief with a knowledge of history.
AID00141346	Maybe he just left instructions for his robots to carry out in his name.
AID00141347	Or maybe Robert House uploaded his brain pattern into a computer and rules to this day, a godless, soulless machine-god!
AID00141348	Or maybe the whole thing's a crazy coincidence. Who knows?
AID00141349	You're being sarcastic, aren't you?
AID00141350	Just a little bit, boss. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
AID00141351	You know what, boss, that's my fault for using sarcasm. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
AID00141352	That's all I wanted to know. We'll talk more later.
AID00141353	Anything you say, boss.
AID00141354	Let's talk about something else.
AID00141355	Anything to hold your attention, boss.
AID00141356	I had some other questions.
AID00141357	You're a veritable guyser of curiosity, boss.
AID00141358	Tell me about New Vegas.
AID00141359	It's big, it's bright, and it's one of the biggest cities still left from before the War. Well, mostly, anyway.
AID00141360	Used to be just a curiosity. The buildings were pre-War, but it was just as full of raiders and barbarian tribes as anyplace else.
AID00141361	Then Mr. House took over, got the power turned back on, and got the tribes reformed into something civilized. Now they run his casinos for him.
AID00141362	How do you feel about Caesar's Legion?
AID00141363	I don't really have a problem with them. People around here tend to see them as invading marauders planning to burn and pillage the countryside.
AID00141364	But I've been to Arizona, boss. Before the Legion, it was a nasty place, so thick with raiders you couldn't trade with a town two miles up the road.
AID00141365	Caesar's laws aren't nice, and their actions aren't always pretty. But then, neither am I, but you keep me around.
AID00141366	What's your take on the NCR?
AID00141367	They're all right, I suppose. Had a bit of tough going there at the beginning - you know their first town was nearly wiped out by raiders?
AID00141368	Anyway, they've got their good points and their bad, just like a lot of the old governments from before the War.
AID00141369	I'm looking for the man who shot me: he wears a checkered coat and carries a shiny pistol. Seen him?
AID00141370	Sure, boss. I saw lots of guys like that while I was held prisoner by an insane supermutant in an isolated mountain fortress. Can you narrow it down?
AID00141371	Benny, huh? Sorry boss, doesn't ring a bell. Then again, my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be.
AID00141372	Do you know anything about a goon named Benny? Wears a checkered coat, carries a big pistol?
AID00141373	Can you tell me anything about Mr. House?
AID00141374	Just how old do you think I am, boss? Because I can pretty much guarantee I'm older than that. Let me tell you a story from before the Great War:
AID00141375	Everybody knew Robert House. He was a genius. A superstar. Founded RobCo at 22, dated Hollywood starlets, the works. They say he saved Las Vegas.
AID00141376	I was in Mexico City when the bombs dropped. Even from there, we could see House's defensive rockets shooting down the incoming missiles.
AID00141377	Everybody assumed he died in the War. Maybe he did. But his robots are still out there, roaming the Wastes. And now, a Mr. House rules New Vegas.
AID00141378	Will you tell me some of your stories again?
AID00141379	That's what I love about you, boss, your firm belief that one day you'll actually remember things people tell you. What do you want to hear about?
AID00141380	RaulStory3
AID00141381	I left everything when I left Mexico: my home, my family, my name - even my face. I know it's surprising, boss, but I wasn't always this handsome.
AID00141382	As far as the world knew, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tuscon - not Two-Sun, by the way.
AID00141383	Things were good there. Well, maybe not good, but better than Mexico City, anyways. I found myself a little shack and started fixing things.
AID00141384	RaulStory2
AID00141385	After the fire, I knew my sister and I couldn't stay at Hidalgo Ranch anymore. The refugees still wanted me dead - they even put a bounty on me.
AID00141386	I remember how scared Rafaela was. I told her if she came with me, we'd see the vaqueros - she used to love the rodeo, especially the trick riders.
AID00141387	We figured maybe we could find help in Mexico City - we were young, we didn't know what had happened, really. We didn't understand about the bombs.
AID00141388	RaulMakeBoomer
AID00141389	That's a good thing to see, huh boss?
AID00141390	RaulCorporalSterling
AID00141391	Got a second to talk, boss?
AID00141392	RaulStory1
AID00141393	I grew up in a place called Hidalgo Ranch just outside Mexico City. It wasn't much, just a bit of farm with a house for three generations of Tejadas.
AID00141394	I wasn't the best-behaved kid. I was quick with my hands, with a pistol or a wrench, and I wasn't afraid to get into fights over it.
AID00141395	I never killed anybody, but I had my share of run-ins with the police. Mostly my family kept me in line.
AID00141396	This was before the war. We were far enough away from Mexico City when the bombs fell that we missed the worst of it - but things got bad quick.
AID00141397	RaulRangerAndy
AID00141398	Hey boss, can I ask you something?
AID00141399	Tell me about yourself.
AID00141400	Sure, boss. What do you want to know?
AID00141401	I have some questions I'd like to ask you.
AID00141402	Questions, boss? You mean you don't know everything there is to know already?
AID00141403	How come your last name isn't Van Graff?
AID00141404	Unlike most of my brothers and sisters, Mama didn't get sick of my father and get rid of him. He died right before I was born.
AID00141405	Mama had liked him so much, she made me use his last name. Said he deserved that much at least, since he never got to meet me or nothin'.
AID00141406	How do you know about Benny?
AID00141407	Little escapes the notice of Caesar's Legion. We know a great deal about the Vegas Strip, and the comings and goings of those who frequent it.
AID00141408	You again? How'd you find me here?
AID00141409	I am the greatest of his Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
AID00141410	I think you'll be a very good distraction.
AID00141411	Yeah, well, don't count on us sticking around if things get too hot. We're not a suicide squad. I'll go to this reunion.
AID00141412	That's way better than what I had in mind.
AID00141413	I hope you weren't thinking we were going to take the lead. That's no job for a bunch of graybeards. Or grayheads, in Whitman's case.
AID00141414	I'll be there at the reunion. Let's hope the others show up, too, or this plan isn't going to work.
AID00141415	Sounds good to me. Does that mean you're in?
AID00141416	I'll be there, but it won't mean squat if the rest of the group isn't there, too.
AID00141417	<Lie> I was hoping you'd want take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
AID00141418	No. I was planning on helping the Legion against the NCR.
AID00141419	<Lie> Then you'll be happy to know I'm planning on helping the Legion.
AID00141420	Are you coming to this thing or what?
AID00141421	<Lie> That's what I was thinking, too.
AID00141422	I want to help the Legion defeat the NCR.
AID00141423	All right, then - I'll show up at this gathering of yours. It might be good to see the others - Johnson excluded.
AID00141424	Arcade might've mentioned there's a pass phrase needed to get into the bunker - my part is "Remember."
AID00141425	So you're not coming?
AID00141426	Oh, I'll come, but depending on the plan, I might not be staying. Keep that in mind.
AID00141427	Does it matter who we help?
AID00141428	Yeah, it does. There's not a chance you'll find me helping the NCR in any way. They've caused me too much grief.
AID00141429	Do you have a preference?
AID00141430	I wouldn't mind cutting down a few platoons of NCR troopers with my old gatling laser.
AID00141431	I haven't decided.
AID00141432	You haven't decided - well, this is just getting better every second, isn't it?
AID00141433	Can you help me find the package I lost?
AID00141434	You take care of our problems here and I'll give you the information that you need.
AID00141435	Them Powder Gangsters got our deputy locked up in the Bison Steve. Be nice to get him out of there... but this town's gonna need some real law.
AID00141436	One of the first things them punks did when they came in was to kill our sheriff. You find us a new one and we can talk.
AID00141437	Where can I get information on the man that shot me?
AID00141438	Beagle had some notes he was taking while he was eavesdropping around the Powder Gangsters. He'll be your best source of information on that subject.
AID00141439	What changed?
AID00141440	He did. For years, he fought with the Council. Taught me to question our direction. Meanwhile he'd become more out-of-touch than all of them.
AID00141441	On our way East he demanded we stop at HELIOS One to examine it. While we were there, we received word that the NCR had taken the Dam.
AID00141442	He was furious. Called it "children playing with a bomb." But he was mad because we'd lost its power. What we'd use it for... he didn't even care.
AID00141443	Did you follow him from California?
AID00141444	It was by his request, actually. He cleared it with the other Elders. Somehow.
AID00141445	They sent him to look into the Dam. There was a time when I'd have begged to follow. Watch him at work.
AID00141446	What was in the note?
AID00141447	It was... strange. Even for Father Elijah. He's always been unstable, but this was... something else.
AID00141448	I don't want to say delusional, but I don't know what else to call it. The only thing familiar about it was the signature.
AID00141449	He said the Brotherhood was doomed, but that he'd return, save us. But the way he said it... I don't know...
AID00141450	Said he'd return with one of the greatest treasures of the Old World, make the Mojave like it was meant to be... wipe the slate clean.
AID00141451	How is that different? What did you learn from him?
AID00141452	I learned what I don't want to become.
AID00141453	In the end, there was just him and his vision. Nothing and no one else.
AID00141454	Let's talk about something else.
AID00141455	Okay.
AID00141456	What did you learn from him?
AID00141457	Elijah could look at an old device and immediately understand what made it work. And he could see its potential. Where it fit with other technology.
AID00141458	It's not something you can teach, but he tried with me. Some of it stuck.
AID00141459	But that's what he taught me. You asked what I learned from him.
AID00141460	Were you close?
AID00141461	Yeah. I miss him.
AID00141462	Where is he now?
AID00141463	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
AID00141464	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
AID00141465	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
AID00141466	[Examine Rex's mechanical parts.]
AID00141467	[Rex's bodywork is battered, scorched, and scratched. It's remarkable that the biological part of him survived at all.]
AID00141468	[Examine Rex's brain case.]
AID00141469	[Rex's new brain looks fresh and healthy.]
AID00141470	[Rex's brain looks sickly, and the gel in which it's contained doesn't look much better.]
AID00141471	[Stop examining Rex.]
AID00141472	<pant pant pant>
AID00141473	[Examine the painting of the bull on Rex's side.]
AID00141474	[The paint, though weathered and fading, is still a recent addition to Rex's bodywork.]
AID00141475	I want to take a closer look at you.
AID00141476	<pant pant pant>
AID00141477	Is it going to rain?
AID00141478	<growl>
AID00141479	Do you smell an ambush?
AID00141480	<growl>
AID00141481	Is there a radioactive twister coming?
AID00141482	<growl>
AID00141483	Are you saying I should stab the next person I see?
AID00141484	<growl>
AID00141485	Did someone fall into a well?
AID00141486	<bark! bark!>
AID00141487	We have better things to do right now.
AID00141488	<whimper>
AID00141489	Let's go check out that well, boy.
AID00141490	<happy bark!>
AID00141491	It's times like this that I wish you could talk.
AID00141492	<whimper>
AID00141493	Huh?
AID00141494	<aroo!>
AID00141495	What's that, Rex? Little Jimmy fell down the well?
AID00141496	<bark! bark!>
AID00141497	What's that, boy? Little Jimmy fell into a well?
AID00141498	Cut that out or I'll turn you into a hat.
AID00141499	<whimper>
AID00141500	We're on the same side. Settle down!
AID00141501	<pant! pant!>
AID00141502	Goodbye.
AID00141503	<whimper>
AID00141504	<bark!>
AID00141505	So you're better? Good - I won't have to strip you for parts.
AID00141506	<whimper>
AID00141507	Glad to hear it.
AID00141508	<bark!>
AID00141509	You're certainly looking better.
AID00141510	<bark!>
AID00141511	Oh, right. You've got a thing about people with hats.
AID00141512	How is that different from how any other Elder would've reacted?
AID00141513	They're cautious. When they discover something, they respect it, learn its limits, consider how to preserve it. Used to drive Father Elijah crazy.
AID00141514	He liked to learn limits, too, but only so he could push them.
AID00141515	That's not to excuse the other Elders, though. They all covet technology for its own sake. Some are just more fanatical than others.
AID00141516	Ever try to talk sense into him?
AID00141517	Yeah, I did. I couldn't help him.
AID00141518	He just didn't listen. And the idea that people talked back to him...
AID00141519	If he could have made the Brotherhood act like machines, ordering them around with a push of a button, he would have.
AID00141520	Are you talking about Andy, or yourself?
AID00141521	A little of both, I guess.
AID00141522	He didn't have to give it up, he's just scared he doesn't have what it takes anymore.
AID00141523	Maybe, but what if he really doesn't have it?
AID00141524	Just because someone's crippled doesn't mean they're useless. All that experience is invaluable.
AID00141525	Yeah, I suppose he could still teach, take a less-active role in the world. That's not so bad.
AID00141526	Guys like us?
AID00141527	Did I say us? I meant "him." Guess my eyesight isn't the only thing that's going.
AID00141528	I think it's good that he's retired. Out of sight, out of mind.
AID00141529	Yeah, I suppose you're right. Guys like us can't compete any more.
AID00141530	Even after a crippling injury, a guy like Andy's tougher and more dangerous than most men alive.
AID00141531	Maybe... yeah. I guess you've got a point there.
AID00141532	He seems like a decent guy.
AID00141533	He's a pathetic waste of space.
AID00141534	I think he's a hero of the NCR.
AID00141535	That wasn't what I meant, really.
AID00141536	What do you mean, guys like Ranger Andy?
AID00141537	I mean guys who have a world of experience doing what they do, but have to give it up because they're getting old and slow, or too injured.
AID00141538	Maybe later, okay?
AID00141539	Yeah, okay, boss. Take your time. Not like I'm a decrepit old man who might keel over dead any minute.
AID00141540	I'd really rather you didn't.
AID00141541	Sure, boss. I'm sure you've got a lot to think about.
AID00141542	Sure, what's on your mind?
AID00141543	What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
AID00141544	RaulSweets
AID00141545	How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
AID00141546	Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
AID00141547	You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
AID00141548	RaulHeavyArmor
AID00141549	Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
AID00141550	Oh, wearing this is not going to be good to me.
AID00141551	Tell me about the girl in Tuscon.
AID00141552	Tell me about your time in Mexico City.
AID00141553	Sounds like fun.
AID00141554	Sounds like cheating.
AID00141555	What do you mean?
AID00141556	Tell me about Hidalgo Ranch and the Great War.
AID00141557	I want to ask you something else about yourself.
AID00141558	I'm an open book, boss. Granted, the book's in Spanish and some of the pages have fallen out, but I'm an open book.
AID00141559	Can you still repair my equipment?
AID00141560	I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can do some routine maintenance to keep your gear working longer.
AID00141561	It won't exactly get better, but it'll get worse slower.
AID00141562	What use are you to me, then?
AID00141563	I sort of figured you had your own reasons for keeping me around, boss.
AID00141564	I don't believe that, you must have some skills.
AID00141565	That's nice of you to say, boss, but I'm an old man. Not much use to anybody any more.
AID00141566	Time was, I was a pretty good shot with a pistol. I guess I'm still half-decent. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
AID00141567	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
AID00141568	How can I make the best use of your skills?
AID00141569	I'm not much use besides being a portable encyclopedia, really. I guess you could use me as a pack brahmin, but my knees aren't so good any more.
AID00141570	I'm still half-decent with a pistol. Not fantastic, but good enough. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
AID00141571	I can keep your gear in good working order, too. If you notice your stuff takes a lot longer to break, well, you can thank me with a sarsaparilla.
AID00141572	Felt good to put the old vaquero outfit on again. I feel a lot sharper with a pistol now. Still wouldn't put these old bones on the front lines.
AID00141573	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
AID00141574	But how did Tabitha find you in the first place?
AID00141575	Ah, it's stupid, boss. I used to listen to the radio broadcasts, just to pass the time.
AID00141576	Well, one day the signal stops, so I figured I'd try to find transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before the eyes started to go.
AID00141577	Anyway, I found Black Mountain and offered my services, but Tabitha decided I was useful enough to keep around. Permanently.
AID00141578	Anything else you want to share?
AID00141579	Boss, usually when somebody gives you a name and nothing else, it's because that's all they want to give you.
AID00141580	Then why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
AID00141581	Probably because it used to be Miguel's.
AID00141582	How'd you end up at Black Mountain?
AID00141583	Well, boss, when a giant, insane Super mutant asks you to stay put, you do what you're told. Well, maybe you don't, but I'm just a broke down old man.
AID00141584	Where'd you get that Vaquero outfit?
AID00141585	I found it in a costume shop. It was sort of my calling card, you know? "Raul the Ghoul, the zombie vaquero of Mexico City."
AID00141586	What's "Petro-Chico?"
AID00141587	You never heard of Petro-Chico, un Amigo de Poseidon Energy? Ah, of course not. They were an oil company in Mexico, back before the War.
AID00141588	How old are you?
AID00141589	Old enough to know better, boss. Old enough to know better.
AID00141590	I was born in 2047, boss. If you do the math on that, I'm sure you'll get within a decade or so.
AID00141591	Where are you from?
AID00141592	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there.
AID00141593	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
AID00141594	We lived there a while, then I moved on and ended up here. I'd rather not talk about it any more.
AID00141595	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
AID00141596	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
AID00141597	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
AID00141598	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
AID00141599	I headed up into Tuscon and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
AID00141600	And that, boss, is all she wrote.
AID00141601	Who are you?
AID00141602	Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
AID00141603	You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
AID00141604	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada.
AID00141605	I'm starting to think you haven't been paying attention, boss.
AID00141606	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger and sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, at your service.
AID00141607	Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
AID00141608	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
AID00141609	Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
AID00141610	Raul Alfonso Tejada, aka Old Miguel, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
AID00141611	VEndingConclusion
AID00141612	And so the Courier's road came to an end... for now.
AID00141613	In the new world of the Mojave wasteland, fighting continued, blood was spilled, and many lived and died - just as they had in the Old World.
AID00141614	Because war... war never changes.
AID00141615	VEndingIntro
AID00141616	And so the Courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again, and the Mojave wasteland was forever changed.
AID00141617	VEndingRemnants
AID00141618	Despite surviving the destruction of the oil rig and the loss of their comrades at Navarro, the venerable Remnants were no match for the Courier.
AID00141619	They carried the secrets of their old lives to their graves.
AID00141620	After their bold arrival at Hoover Dam, the Remnants disappeared as quickly as they came.
AID00141621	Legends of their power spread throughout the southwest, a reminder of why people once feared the sight of vertibirds in the sky.
AID00141622	Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
AID00141623	Well aware of the full extent of their power, Caesar commanded his troops to not pursue them.
AID00141624	Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
AID00141625	Caesar's heirs aggressively pursued the Remnants into Arizona, losing hundreds of Legionaries in the process and gaining nothing in return.
AID00141626	VEndingRangers
AID00141627	After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
AID00141628	Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
AID00141629	Defying Chief Hanlon's worst fears, NCR's rangers persevered and distinguished themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
AID00141630	The rangers, along with NCR's many troopers, shared the glory of victory.
AID00141631	Hanlon wisely stayed out of the spotlight, crediting General Oliver's leadership for NCR's success.
AID00141632	After a brief fanfare, Hanlon stepped down as chief and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch outside of Redding.
AID00141633	During the attack on Hoover Dam, Chief Hanlon and his rangers threw themselves into the path of the Legion assault, dying to the last man and woman.
AID00141634	In the aftermath that followed in the NCR, bitter citizens and opportunistic senators were quick to denounce President Kimball and General Oliver.
AID00141635	Hanlon and his fallen rangers were revered for their bravery and sacrifice.
AID00141636	Despite distinguishing themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, the rangers' victory was short-lived due to the Courier's interference.
AID00141637	Chief Hanlon personally directed the evacuation of the rangers to Mojave Outpost as they fell back into NCR territory.
AID00141638	Bitter over the waste of life in the Mojave, Hanlon stepped down from his post.
AID00141639	After a campaign in which he denounced Oliver's and Kimball's hawkish, imperialist ways, Hanlon was elected as the senator of Redding.
AID00141640	Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
AID00141641	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver hailed as NCR's new war hero, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
AID00141642	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the organization quickly dwindled.
AID00141643	With Caesar's victory came a small measure of vindication for the rangers' late Chief Hanlon.
AID00141644	Upon the military's return, debate raged within NCR's senate about who was to blame for the loss of Hoover Dam.
AID00141645	Though some in NCR regarded Hanlon as a traitor, many believed he was the only military commander who saw the futility in defending New Vegas.
AID00141646	Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
AID00141647	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver denounced for losing Hoover Dam, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
AID00141648	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the military as a whole quickly dwindled.
AID00141649	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
AID00141650	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
AID00141651	Though General Oliver and Chief Hanlon were both praised for their leadership, the chief quietly stepped out of the spotlight.
AID00141652	After a brief fanfare for a life full of accomplishments, Chief Hanlon retired and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch in Redding.
AID00141653	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
AID00141654	The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
AID00141655	Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
AID00141656	Out of respect for Hanlon's composure and worth as an adversary, Caesar had him beheaded.
AID00141657	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
AID00141658	The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
AID00141659	Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
AID00141660	Despite the late Caesar's respect for Chief Hanlon as an adversary, Legate Lanius had Hanlon crucified along with all of the other rangers.
AID00141661	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
AID00141662	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
AID00141663	Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
AID00141664	Hanlon, exhausted after a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
AID00141665	VEndingPrimm
AID00141666	Primm, already torn apart by Powder Gangers, was dealt a killing blow by the Courier.
AID00141667	Though prospectors pick through the remains of the town from time to time, no one re-establishes it as a settlement.
AID00141668	After Hoover Dam, NCR helps rebuild Primm as a major stopping point on the Long 15.
AID00141669	Though Primm's citizens chafe under NCR's taxes, they benefit greatly from the increased protection and merchant traffic.
AID00141670	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Mr. House.
AID00141671	As repayment for their NCR loyalty, Mr. House sends Securitrons to Primm to "protect" it and collect heavy taxes from its citizens.
AID00141672	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Caesar.
AID00141673	Though Caesar keeps Primm open for business, its citizens live under the constant watch of Legion soldiers.
AID00141674	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to the Courier.
AID00141675	Independent again, Primm operates much as it had before the Powder Gangs arrived: full of ups and downs.
AID00141676	After Hoover Dam, Sheriff Meyers runs Primm with his own style of frontier justice.
AID00141677	He deals with most folks fairly, but now and then someone winds up dead with little to no evidence against them.
AID00141678	Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers choose to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
AID00141679	Though the citizens take out a few Legionaries, the town quickly falls to Caesar, its citizens utterly wiped out.
AID00141680	Primm Slim proves to be an able-minded, if not able-bodied, sheriff for Primm.
AID00141681	Due to his slow speed, some crooks get away without a scratch, but Primm continues to prosper under his watchful robotic eye.
AID00141682	Not understanding the gravity of the Legion's imminent takeover of Primm, Sheriff Primm Slim valiantly attempts to resist Caesar's will.
AID00141683	VEndingPowderGang
AID00141684	With Cooke dead, the Powder Gangers at Vault 19 fell apart.
AID00141685	Those who weren't destroyed by the Courier fled into the hills or attempted to work their way back through the Mojave Wasteland. Few survived.
AID00141686	Armed with a wide array of improvised explosives and stolen weapons, the Vault 19 Powder Gang tormented the Mojave Wasteland for years.
AID00141687	Citizens of the NCR were favorite targets, and they always suffered the worst fates.
AID00141688	After the Vault 19 Powder Gang surrendered to the NCR, they were re-incorporated into the correctional system.
AID00141689	The NCR did increase their sentences, as they aren't about to take off time for good behavior.
AID00141690	After the majority of the Vault 19 Powder Gangers joined the Great Khans, the weaker members scattered throughout the Mojave Wasteland.
AID00141691	Though a few managed to erase their pasts, most never survived the journey.
AID00141692	VEndingNovac
AID00141693	Despite their vigilance against potential attacks by the Legion, the citizens of Novac were no match for the Courier.
AID00141694	The motel and Dinky the Dinosaur were left vacant, a rare stop at best for travelers along Highway 95.
AID00141695	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
AID00141696	In the weeks that followed, feral ghouls, overflowing from the REPCONN Test Site, ravaged the weakened town.
AID00141697	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
AID00141698	With no other communities coming to its defense, Novac would eventually fall to the Legion's persistent attacks.
AID00141699	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
AID00141700	In the weeks that followed, several Bright Followers returned to Novac to help restore its defenses, allowing it to remain independent of NCR.
AID00141701	During the Legion's attack on Novac, Bright Followers, returning from their long pilgrimage, assisted in its evacuation.
AID00141702	Though Novac eventually fell to the Legion, many citizens of Novac were able to escape, alive and intact.
AID00141703	While the destruction of the REPCONN rockets appeared to be a boon to the salvagers of Novac, the benefit would never be realized.
AID00141704	Radioactive fuel from the wrecked ships seeped out and contaminated the area. Salvagers were forced to move on, and the town was abandoned.
AID00141705	VEndingMisfits
AID00141706	Slain to the last man by the Courier, the Misfits were at least spared the humiliation of dying during Caesar's attack on Camp Golf.
AID00141707	Few mourned their absence.
AID00141708	Shaped up by the Courier's advice, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack on Camp Golf.
AID00141709	Mags was finally promoted to Sergeant, and the rest of the Misfits received an official commendation.
AID00141710	They continued to serve with distinction for many years.
AID00141711	Though Camp Golf fell to Caesar, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack.
AID00141712	Mags and her soldiers were posthumously recognized for their valor by NCR.
AID00141713	The Misfits' laziness caught up with them when the Legion attacked Camp Golf.
AID00141714	Those who weren't killed in the attack attempted to flee, but were caught at Mojave Outpost, court-martialed, and hanged from the ranger monument.
AID00141715	Driven into a frenzy by their use of Psycho, the Misfits inflicted heavy casualties on the Legion during the defense of Camp Golf.
AID00141716	At first they were commended for their valor, but eventually, desperate for more of the chem, they turned on travelers in Outer Vegas.
AID00141717	For their dishonorable conduct, the NCR court-martialed and executed them by firing squad.
AID00141718	VEndingKings
AID00141719	With the King dead and most of their gang slain by the Courier, the remaining Kings fled the area, never to be heard from again.
AID00141720	After the NCR victory at Hoover Dam, the temporary truce between them and the Kings blossomed into a full-scale relief effort for the people.
AID00141721	While the NCR made repeated entreaties that Freeside join the Republic, the Kings steadfastly maintained their independence.
AID00141722	Accusing the Kings of lying with a foreign invader for their newfound ties to the NCR, Mr. House punished them by ordering their forced removal.
AID00141723	The Kings, defiant to the end, were destroyed to the last man by House's Securitrons.
AID00141724	Following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, Freeside came to be known as one of the more stable areas in the region.
AID00141725	Ironically, NCR refugees found Freeside safer than most of the rest of New Vegas, where resentment still lingers.
AID00141726	After their victory at Hoover Dam, the Legion quickly set about destroying all remaining resistance, including any groups with ties to the NCR.
AID00141727	Upon discovering the Kings' newfound relationship with the NCR, Legionaires flooded the streets of Freeside, and the Kings were quickly destroyed.
AID00141728	While the NCR was busy fighting the Legion at Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to attack NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
AID00141729	When the NCR moved to secure the region, they cracked down the hardest on Freeside, sending a full platoon to sweep the neighborhood.
AID00141730	Most of the Kings were killed, with the few survivors driven out into the wastes.
AID00141731	During the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to launch several attacks on NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
AID00141732	Mr. House looked on these actions favorably, seeing them as proof of the Kings' loyalty to New Vegas, and decided to leave them alone.
AID00141733	In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Kings took the opportunity to viciously force all NCR citizens out of Freeside.
AID00141734	Travelers from the Republic quickly learned to avoid Freeside if they valued their safety.
AID00141735	Impressed with the Kings' continued attacks upon NCR citizens and soldiers, the Legion offered them the option of being assimilated into the Legion.
AID00141736	The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
AID00141737	As the NCR moved to secure the region, the occupation of Freeside proved especially problematic.
AID00141738	Things remained tense due to numerous incidents, though the Kings were still in nominal control of the area.
AID00141739	Flush with his victory, Mr. House sent Securitrons into Freeside, thinking to increase his control over the area.
AID00141740	When fighting broke out, the Kings fought valiantly, but were no match for the armored killing machines, and were wiped out to the last man.
AID00141741	The Kings retained their control of Freeside, and while they continued to favor the needs of locals, they tolerated the citizens of the defeated NCR.
AID00141742	After their victory at Hoover Dam, Legion troops rolled through Freeside.
AID00141743	The Kings tried to fight back, but most were killed, and the rest fled into the wasteland.
AID00141744	VEndingJacobstown
AID00141745	With Jacobstown's leadership destroyed, the remaining Super Mutants and Nightkin of the west scattered across the wasteland.
AID00141746	Jacobstown withered away, its death going unnoticed by the rest of the Mojave.
AID00141747	Thanks to the Courier and Lily, a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was found shortly after Doctor Henry's experiment concluded.
AID00141748	Nightkin and other Super Mutants in the wasteland flocked to Jacobstown, and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace.
AID00141749	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
AID00141750	Disgruntled by the death of their leader, Keene, most of the Nightkin scattered into the wasteland, their insanity worsening with each day.
AID00141751	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
AID00141752	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
AID00141753	Most Nightkin at Jacobstown followed their leader Keene out into the wasteland, terrorizing the Mojave for years to come.
AID00141754	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
AID00141755	It took more time than anticipated for a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia to be found, but in the end it was beneficial to Jacobstown.
AID00141756	The presence of the Nightkin leader, Keene, persuaded Nightkin from across the wasteland to make the journey to the town.
AID00141757	Jacobstown prospered, becoming known as a fair - if somewhat intimidating - place for a trader to do business.
AID00141758	With no cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia in sight, the disgruntled Nightkin left Jacobstown. Without a treatment, their insanity grew.
AID00141759	The crazed Nightkin terrorized the wasteland, and Jacobstown suffered repeated reprisals from mutant-hating humans.
AID00141760	In the end, the surviving mutants abandoned Jacobstown entirely, its existence quickly forgotten by the rest of the wasteland.
AID00141761	VEndingGreatKhans
AID00141762	After generations of being beaten down, the Great Khans were finally broken by the Courier.
AID00141763	Those few who avoided the Courier's wrath moved north, into the wilderness of Idaho, where they tried once more to rebuild.
AID00141764	After the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans returned for a time to Red Rock Canyon.
AID00141765	The NCR's pressing need to expand proved greater than its promise of amnesty, and before long the government decided the Khans had to go.
AID00141766	The surviving Great Khans were relocated to an isolated, barren reservation, well north of NCR trade routes.
AID00141767	For supporting the NCR, the Great Khans were ruthlessly hunted down by the victorious Legion.
AID00141768	Caesar destroyed all evidence of their existence at Red Rock Canyon, and forbade mention of their name in any history.
AID00141769	The Great Khans' legacy was swiftly forgotten.
AID00141770	As reward for their loyal service, Caesar forcibly integrated the Great Khans into the Legion.
AID00141771	The sick and elderly were killed, the women sold as wives to ranking officers, and the tribe's identity was annihilated.
AID00141772	Though many Great Khans mourned the death of their tribe, many more were ultimately satisfied with their revenge against NCR.
AID00141773	After driving the Legion out of the Mojave Wasteland, the victorious NCR turned its attention to those who had allied themselves with Caesar.
AID00141774	The Great Khans were among the first tribes to suffer this fate, and the few who survived Hoover Dam were driven north, into the wilderness of Idaho.
AID00141775	During the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans quickly evacuated Red Rock Canyon and headed north and east into the plains of Wyoming.
AID00141776	There, they reconnected with the Followers of the Apocalypse and rebuilt their strength.
AID00141777	Bolstered by ancient knowledge of governance, economics, and transportation, they carved a mighty empire out of the ruins of the Northwest.
AID00141778	After their suicidal last stand at Hoover Dam, the Great Khans ceased to exist as a tribe.
AID00141779	The few surviving members dispersed, joining up with other tribes and gangs across the Mojave, and quickly forgot their heritage.
AID00141780	VEndingGoodsprings
AID00141781	Travelers continued to stop by Goodsprings Source for water on the Long 15, but rarely would anyone venture into the ruins of Goodsprings itself.
AID00141782	Those who did were almost always tourists, come to visit the graveyard where the Courier "rose from the dead."
AID00141783	Goodsprings saw more trade along I-15 after NCR gained control of the Mojave Wasteland, but with that came a heavy burden of the Republic's taxes.
AID00141784	Some old-timers, unable to handle the cost, were forced to move on, grumbling all the while.
AID00141785	The Legion, preoccupied with its acquisition of New Vegas, scarcely took notice of the town of Goodsprings.
AID00141786	Many locals moved on, fearful of Caesar's long shadow. Only the old and the stubborn remained.
AID00141787	After Mr. House gained control of New Vegas, he sent a Securitron to Goodsprings as a token of appreciation for helping the Courier.
AID00141788	Victor was a mixed blessing, however, as he continually monitored the town for Mr. House.
AID00141789	With New Vegas' independence formally declared, Goodsprings thrived.
AID00141790	More travelers stopped by Goodsprings on their way to and from the Strip, and the locals grew prosperous from the traffic.
AID00141791	VEndingFollowers
AID00141792	With no clear leader to guide efforts in Freeside, the Followers of the Apocalypse lost control of Old Mormon Fort to local thugs and junkies.
AID00141793	Eventually, using the Followers' remaining supplies to manufacture drugs, the Old Mormon Fort quickly devolved into little more than a junkie den.
AID00141794	After the NCR's victory at the dam, the Followers of the Apocalypse were pushed out of Old Mormon Fort during its occupation by NCR forces.
AID00141795	NCR further "encouraged" them to leave Outer Vegas entirely, and the Followers had no choice but to comply.
AID00141796	After the NCR's victory at the dam, in part thanks to Follower medical support, NCR allowed the Followers to care for refugees as they see fit.
AID00141797	Old Mormon Fort expanded its services and was able to aid more people, becoming a refuge for the less fortunate citizens of New Vegas.
AID00141798	After the Legion's victory, the new Caesar learned the Followers had "defamed" the original Caesar's noble origins.
AID00141799	The Followers of the Apocalypse were hunted down and exterminated, and Old Mormon Fort was turned into a pile of rubble.
AID00141800	After the Legion's victory, Caesar, out of a strange respect for his old fellows, allowed the Followers safe passage out of the wasteland.
AID00141801	Reluctantly, the Followers accepted the offer and abandoned Old Mormon Fort to the Legion.
AID00141802	After the Courier ensured New Vegas remain free, the Followers found that independent Vegas was even more unstable and violent than before.
AID00141803	Old Mormon Fort became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, struggling to provide even the most basic of services.
AID00141804	VEndingFiends
AID00141805	Their leaders destroyed by the Courier, the Fiends scattered throughout the wasteland.
AID00141806	Without the organization of Motor-Runner, Cook-Cook, Violet, and Driver Nephi, they were easy prey.
AID00141807	Never weakened by NCR, the Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
AID00141808	Though NCR repulsed the Fiends, they suffered heavy losses in the process.
AID00141809	The Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
AID00141810	During the NCR's retreat, the Fiends overwhelmed many of the troopers before Mr. House's Securitrons could deal with them.
AID00141811	The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
AID00141812	In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.
AID00141813	Though weakened, the Fiends attacked McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
AID00141814	NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses and, in the following days, destroyed the remaining Fiend leaders, breaking their power forever.
AID00141815	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and suffered heavy losses.
AID00141816	Caesar, unimpressed with their performance and their dependence on chems, had them exterminated.
AID00141817	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, but the NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses.
AID00141818	When Mr. House asserted control over Outer Vegas, his Securitrons eradicated the remaining Fiends entirely.
AID00141819	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and, despite suffering heavy losses, overran it.
AID00141820	They continued to be a nuisance throughout Outer Vegas, but never established full control over the area.
AID00141821	VEndingBrotherhood
AID00141822	Buried beneath tons of rubble, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was no more.
AID00141823	Those few who were outside the Hidden Valley bunker when it was destroyed settled into new lives, or headed west to find a new chapter to join.
AID00141824	During the fight for Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood took HELIOS One, inflicting heavy damage on retreating NCR forces, but it was a pyrrhic victory.
AID00141825	Once The Strip was secured, Caesar's forces overwhelmed and eventually routed the Brotherhood from HELIOS One and Hidden Valley.
AID00141826	The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley.
AID00141827	With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along I-15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.
AID00141828	The Brotherhood and the NCR in the Mojave Wasteland declared an official truce, despite continued hostilities between the two in the west.
AID00141829	As per their agreement, the NCR handed over all suits of salvaged power armor and in return the Brotherhood helped patrol I-15 and Highway 95.
AID00141830	Due to their temporary truce, the Brotherhood allowed the NCR to retreat from the Mojave Wasteland without incident.
AID00141831	In the relative peace that followed, Brotherhood patrols appeared along major roads, harassing travelers over any bits of technology they had.
AID00141832	VEndingBoomers
AID00141833	Without organized leadership, the remaining Boomers slowly drifted away, leaving Nellis Air Force Base to be flooded by prospectors and scavengers.
AID00141834	All of the Boomers' accumulated knowledge quickly scattered, and their existence slowly faded from memory.
AID00141835	After the battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR mounted several campaigns against the Boomers, but all were quickly ended by the Boomers' artillery.
AID00141836	Over time, as the Boomers found a need for gun powder, they developed a relationship with the Gun Runners, trading their surplus crops for munitions.
AID00141837	Mr. House showed little interest in the Boomers and left them to themselves in Nellis.
AID00141838	The tribe remained fortified in Nellis with their backs to the world.
AID00141839	The Boomers defended themselves against many attacks from the Legion, but they eventually fell to the Legion's superior numbers.
AID00141840	The Legion enslaved the Boomers and erased any memory of their existence from the wasteland.
AID00141841	With little law left in the wasteland, the Boomers continued to defend themselves against the prospectors and scavengers invading their territory.
AID00141842	With the help of the Gun Runners, the Boomers developed a healthy trading relationship with the NCR.
AID00141843	Eventually the Boomers began wandering out into the wasteland, while still preventing outsiders from entering Nellis.
AID00141844	Mr. House showed little interest on the Boomers, who eventually began venturing out of Nellis to meet and trade with travelers.
AID00141845	Cautious after the Boomers' display of power at Hoover Dam, Caesar chose to leave the Boomers alone.
AID00141846	The Boomers remained isolated but have been seen flying over the Mojave Desert from time to time.
AID00141847	Though the Wasteland became anarchic after Hoover Dam, the Boomers' display of power dissuaded fortune seekers from attempting to penetrate Nellis.
AID00141848	VEndingBlackMountain
AID00141849	Though some Super Mutants and Nightkin continued to journey to the legendary Utobitha, they found little trace of its existence.
AID00141850	Some eventually found their way to Jacobstown, but many wandered off into the wastes, confused and disheartened.
AID00141851	Tabitha and Rhonda went east, through Caesar's land. Occasionally tales of their exploits found their way back west, though few believed them.
AID00141852	Eventually the stories concerning the duo were collected and published, and proved to be quite popular with children.
AID00141853	Black Mountain Radio continued to broadcast its peculiar form of propaganda. Raul Tejada faced his execution each day, though pardoned in the end.
AID00141854	Travelers venturing too near Black Mountain continue to be harassed by Tabitha's followers.
AID00141855	Tabitha, enraged by Raul's escape, took the remaining Nightkin of Black Mountain with her and vanished without a trace.
AID00141856	Travelers in the region soon learned to avoid the roads at night, as caravans were repeatedly attacked by unseen assailants.
AID00141857	VEndingCourier
AID00141858	The Courier, fair and even-handed in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
AID00141859	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the republic.
AID00141860	Though the Courier's agenda was debated by many, he was honored by NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
AID00141861	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AID00141862	With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
AID00141863	Despite his extreme actions, he was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AID00141864	Though the Courier himself was just and forthright in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, he helped the Legion achieve victory.
AID00141865	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00141866	The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
AID00141867	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00141868	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
AID00141869	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00141870	The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
AID00141871	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, out of gratitude - and a quiet sense of pride for his choice in lieutenants.
AID00141872	The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
AID00141873	Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations. Mr. House afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
AID00141874	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
AID00141875	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, partly out of gratitude, and party out of fear.
AID00141876	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
AID00141877	He ensured Mr. House's tyranny was broken and neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
AID00141878	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
AID00141879	He had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
AID00141880	Supporting all the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
AID00141881	He ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
AID00141882	VEndingNCR
AID00141883	The New California Republic celebrated its second victory at Hoover Dam, establishing definitive control over the entire Mojave Wasteland.
AID00141884	Soon after, they negotiated terms to annex The Strip, Freeside, and many surrounding communities.
AID00141885	The Mojave wasteland, at long last, had entirely fallen under the NCR's banner.
AID00141886	VEndingMrHouse
AID00141887	Mr. House's Securitron army took control of Hoover Dam and The Strip, pushing both the Legion and the exhausted NCR out of New Vegas.
AID00141888	Mr. House continued to run New Vegas his way, a despotic vision of Pre-War glory. The streets were orderly, efficient, cold.
AID00141889	New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.
AID00141890	VEndingIndependent
AID00141891	The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
AID00141892	With Mr. House out of the picture, the remaining Securitrons on The Strip were hard-pressed to keep order. Anarchy ruled the streets.
AID00141893	When the fires died, New Vegas remained, assuming its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
AID00141894	The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
AID00141895	With Mr. House out of the picture, part of the Securitron army was diverted to the Strip to keep order. Any chaos on the streets was ended, quickly.
AID00141896	Chaos became uncertainty, then acceptance, with minimal loss of life. New Vegas assumed its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
AID00141897	VEndingCaesarDead
AID00141898	The Legate is crowned as the new Caesar. He entered The Strip as though it was a military target, destroying anyone who resisted him.
AID00141899	The Legion brutally occupied all major locations, killing and enslaving a large amount of the population.
AID00141900	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - savage as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
AID00141901	VEndingCaesarAlive
AID00141902	Caesar entered The Strip as though it was his Triumph. The Legion pushed the NCR out of New Vegas entirely, driving them back to the Mojave Outpost.
AID00141903	The Legion occupied all major locations, enslaving much of the population and peacefully lording over the rest.
AID00141904	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - unforgiving as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
AID00141905	VEndingRaul
AID00141906	After a long and eventful life, Raul's luck finally ran out during his time with the Courier.
AID00141907	Still grappling with self-doubt over his usefulness in the face of old age, Raul was never able to find peace with himself.
AID00141908	Eventually, he left the Mojave and assumed a new name, as he had done so many times before.
AID00141909	Invigorated by his travels with the Courier, Raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost Rafaela.
AID00141910	Soon after, the Mojave was filled with tales of the ghost-vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak.
AID00141911	Convinced that his time as a gunslinger was past, Raul made peace with the idea of growing old.
AID00141912	After traveling with the Courier for a time, he retired and settled down in Outer Vegas, where he would spend his days fixing ancient machinery.
AID00141913	VEndingVeronica
AID00141914	At odds with leadership over the Brotherhood's future, Veronica looked to the Mojave Wasteland for an answer both she and they could live with.
AID00141915	But the answer would never come, and the dangers of the world that had left the Brotherhood of Steel behind would eventually claim her life.
AID00141916	Hoping to lead the Mojave Brotherhood down a new path, Veronica sought to learn from the thriving cultures of the desert.
AID00141917	Absent a firm solution, Veronica's expression of frustration with Brotherhood leadership would lead to her banishment.
AID00141918	She ended her days a wandering tinker.
AID00141919	Despite her departure from the group, the Brotherhood's peace treaty with NCR came as some relief to Veronica.
AID00141920	Though she remained friendly with surface patrols, she was never again permitted to enter the bunker she once called home.
AID00141921	Fearing for the safety of anyone she associated with, she continued her solitary life as a scavenger.
AID00141922	But reports would emerge from Mojave scientists and social workers of old equipment miraculously repaired and research notes mysteriously completed.
AID00141923	Though she'd seen the writing on the wall, the destruction of the Mojave Brotherhood came far more suddenly than Veronica had expected.
AID00141924	The news devastated her. Despite her best efforts to leave her past behind, she found herself compelled to make one final journey to Hidden Valley.
AID00141925	There, she paid her last respects to the only family she had ever known.
AID00141926	The Brotherhood's open aggression along the New Vegas highways troubled Veronica greatly.
AID00141927	Nevertheless, it removed all doubt from her mind that in leaving them she had made the right choice.
AID00141928	Eventually she would take to the road, less in hopes of finding a new home than of leaving memories of the old one behind her.
AID00141929	The peace with NCR served to ease Veronica's worries about the Brotherhood's immediate future.
AID00141930	Still, a distance had arisen between her and her fellow members that would never be bridged.
AID00141931	She began secluding herself in crumbling libraries of the Old World, learning of promising technologies she knew the Brotherhood would never adopt.
AID00141932	The death of the Mojave Brotherhood came much too soon for Veronica, and in their absence, she felt truly lost.
AID00141933	Yet in its wake, she took small comfort in her decision to remain by their side through their few remaining days.
AID00141934	Veronica put her moral sensibilities aside and supported the Brotherhood's new campaign of aggression as best she could.
AID00141935	Yet deep down, she understood that it meant their end would surely be soon to follow.
AID00141936	VEndingLily
AID00141937	Lily's long life finally came to a close in the Mojave Wasteland. As the life faded from her, her last thoughts were of her grandchildren.
AID00141938	Encouraged by the Courier to take her medication regularly, Lily's mind eventually attained a semblance of clarity.
AID00141939	Her memories dulled by the pills, she cast aside the recording of her grandchildren, no longer remembering its significance.
AID00141940	Lily continued to take her medicine at half-doses, and although she remembered her grandchildren, her mind remained muddled and confused.
AID00141941	Eventually, she parted ways with the Courier and traveled west, seeking the remnants of her past.
AID00141942	Encouraged by the Courier to stop taking her medication altogether, Lily's instabilities grew worse with each passing day.
AID00141943	Eventually she became little more than a ravening beast, the kindly old grandmother subsumed beneath the rage.
AID00141944	VEndingEdE
AID00141945	After a long and fantastic journey, ED-E finally met its end with the dangers of the Mojave.
AID00141946	It lay destroyed and gathering dust, waiting for scavengers to pick through its remains for salvage.
AID00141947	ED-E remained forgotten in the shop of Johnson Nash, until it was repaired by another courier who let it continue on its journey to Navarro.
AID00141948	ED-E was eventually discovered by the Followers of the Apocalypse who managed to recover vast databanks of scientific knowledge.
AID00141949	ED-E traveled with the Courier until one of its memory banks was triggered causing it to continue its travels on to Navarro.
AID00141950	Upon reaching Navarro ED-E vanished and was not see in the wastes again.
AID00141951	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E  remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
AID00141952	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
AID00141953	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E  remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
AID00141954	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
AID00141955	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
AID00141956	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
AID00141957	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
AID00141958	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
AID00141959	VEndingRex
AID00141960	He had survived police service in Colorado, the Great War, combat duty with the Legion, and being the companion of The King.
AID00141961	But, in the end, Rex finally succumbed to the horrors of the wasteland.
AID00141962	Having never received a replacement brain, Rex finally succumbed to old age, abruptly shutting down forever one quiet morning.
AID00141963	After two centuries of life and decades of service to humanity, Rex collapses and dies.
AID00141964	Revitalized by Violetta's brain, Rex eventually learned to balance the memories of his old life with Violetta's experiences among the brutal Fiends.
AID00141965	His mind had difficulty adjusting, but Rex eventually found peace with his new, more vicious self.
AID00141966	With the transplant of Lupa's brain, Rex gained all of the donor's experiences traveling with the Legion.
AID00141967	These melded well with his own memories of the Legion, and his new mind quickly adjusted to the myriad memories.
AID00141968	After Rey's brain was transplanted into Rex's cybernetic body, it took Rex some time to adjust to the old scrap yard dog's memories.
AID00141969	Eventually, Rex's mind settled peacefully, melding his own memories with that of long travels with Old Lady Gibson.
AID00141970	VEndingCass
AID00141971	Rose of Sharon Cassidy died as her caravan died - in an unmarked grave, another victim of the Mojave.
AID00141972	Despite the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, Cass lived for 30 more years.
AID00141973	She made her way back West and passed away in a small shack outside of Vault City, the rose pendant still around her neck.
AID00141974	The slaughter of the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan caused no end of trouble for NCR back West.
AID00141975	Already struggling, NCR's supply lines suffered further as the two caravans withdrew support until the "massacre in the East" was resolved.
AID00141976	In the years following the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, NCR used evidence of the plot to blackmail the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs.
AID00141977	NCR enacted strict trade laws with little resistance, strengthening their supply lines and their position in the Mojave.
AID00141978	Cass survived to see the NCR flag flying proud over Hoover Dam, and thought for a moment... this is what a hero must feel like.
AID00141979	Cass lived to see Hoover Dam in its Old World glory, humming with power the likes of which the Mojave had never seen.
AID00141980	Vegas burned brighter than ever, Securitrons filled the streets, and Cass's heart skipped... just a little.
AID00141981	Her last words were to the Dam - and to herself. "We were going full speed ahead... but facing backwards the whole time."
AID00141982	Cass lived to see the Courier bring down three armies and by her count, that was three more than she'd expected. She'd kept quiet about that, though.
AID00141983	Cass lived to see the mark of the Legion on Hoover Dam. Uncertain of what lay next for the West, she remained silent.
AID00141984	As the Legion marched West, she found it difficult to see the Dam as anything more than a gravestone for the Mojave - and everyone in it.
AID00141985	VEndingArcade
AID00141986	Though Arcade's intentions were pure and his goals were noble, he ultimately succumbed to the harsh brutality of the Mojave like so many before him.
AID00141987	Tricked by the Courier and imprisoned by the Legion, Arcade remained Caesar's personal physician for several years.
AID00141988	Caesar grew fond of speaking with such an educated man on philosophical matters. Arcade became his unwilling intellectual sparring partner.
AID00141989	After years of such servitude, during an unguarded moment, Arcade used a surgical scalpel and his bare hands to disembowel himself.
AID00141990	Lacking any other skilled medical personnel, the Legion was unable to prevent his death. Caesar mourned his loss for months.
AID00141991	Though the Legion was victorious at Hoover Dam, the Legate did not have the same medical needs as Caesar.
AID00141992	Lanius quickly tired of Arcade's acerbic wit and had the doctor crucified.
AID00141993	During the retreat of Caesar's Legion from the Mojave Wasteland, Arcade was a sad casualty, one of many.
AID00141994	His body was heaped with those of many others in a nameless ravine on the Legion's long march home.
AID00141995	Though Arcade had not hoped for an NCR victory, he was proud of his role in the defense of Hoover Dam against the forces of Caesar's Legion.
AID00141996	Unfortunately, when word spread that Arcade was once a member of the Enclave, he was forced out of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AID00141997	Pursued by bounty hunters, NCR rangers, and the Brotherhood of Steel, Arcade pushed deep into the eastern plains and was never heard from again.
AID00141998	Arcade had hoped that Freeside would be able to remain independent of NCR rule, but he was glad that Caesar's Legion had been stopped at Hoover Dam.
AID00141999	He tended to the sick in Freeside for a while longer, then returned to NCR territory to become a teacher with the Followers there.
AID00142000	Though Arcade was crushed by the Legion's victory at Hoover Dam, he was not among NCR's casualties.
AID00142001	During the NCR's retreat from the Mojave Wasteland, he helped defend NCR citizens and refugees on their way to Mojave Outpost.
AID00142002	Unfortunately, NCR rangers identified his father's armor as Enclave property. He was arrested, tried as a war criminal, and imprisoned indefinitely.
AID00142003	When news reached Freeside that Legion forces were approaching New Vegas, Arcade did his best to help people escape with adequate supplies.
AID00142004	A Legion explorer saw Arcade helping locals escape and pointed him out to a Centurion.
AID00142005	Arcade's group was run down somewhere near Westside. There were no survivors.
AID00142006	Arcade was outraged by Mr. House's power play following the defeat of Caesar's Legion at Hoover Dam.
AID00142007	Though he remained in Freeside for a short time after the Securitrons established widespread control, he eventually traveled back into NCR territory.
AID00142008	Disillusioned with the Followers of the Apocalypse, he settled down in the outskirts of the Boneyard, where he worked happily as a family doctor.
AID00142009	Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who helped repel the Legion from Hoover Dam.
AID00142010	He was prouder still to see the area freed from the shackles of the NCR and Mr. House.
AID00142011	Though independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it could be, Arcade used his Enclave knowledge and technology to keep order wherever he could.
AID00142012	Arcade was tending to the locals of Freeside when he learned that Caesar's Legion had been defeated and NCR was being pushed out of New Vegas.
AID00142013	Though he found that independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it would be, Arcade did his best to help the locals govern themselves.
AID00142014	Though Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who turned back the Legion at Hoover Dam, he was crushed by Mr. House's ascent to power.
AID00142015	Saddened by the loss of life and liberty in the area, Arcade left the Mojave Wasteland for parts unknown. He was never heard from again.
AID00142016	VEndingBoone
AID00142017	Tired of waiting for the world to be done with him, Boone ventured into the wastes to make his own way out.
AID00142018	Unable to clear his mind of the past, he was at last granted the death he'd awaited, bringing final rest to a life that had ended long ago.
AID00142019	As the Battle of Hoover Dam ended, Boone confirmed what he had always suspected - that revenge would never quiet his troubled mind.
AID00142020	Side arm in hand, he journeyed back to California in search of the NCR officer who had led the attack on Bitter Springs.
AID00142021	There, with only two bullets loaded, Boone did the only thing he believed would put an end to his suffering.
AID00142022	Looking for a place where he could be of some use, Boone found himself re-enlisting with his old unit.
AID00142023	Though his regrets remained in his thoughts, they coalesced into a purpose, and Boone embraced it.
AID00142024	He spent his leave time hunting down slavers in the desert, his First Recon beret the last thing they never saw.
AID00142025	Though NCR was withdrawing from the region, Boone remained in New Vegas, finding work as a security guard and caravan scout along the highways.
AID00142026	While he might've preferred rejoining his old unit, Boone couldn't bring himself to abandon the city where he'd met his wife.
AID00142027	Boone refused to take the Legion's victory lying down.
AID00142028	Heading to the hills with his rifle, he began a deadly campaign against high-ranking Legion officers.
AID00142029	And though the price on his head rose to levels unheard of, few pursued it, fearing it would be the last thing they'd never see.
AID00142030	No longer held in check by his conscience, Boone found lucrative work as a mercenary and assassin.
AID00142031	No job was too violent, no target too innocent. As long as the caps were good, Boone would take the job.
AID00142032	Driven mad by Caesar's victory at Hoover Dam, and unable to escape his memories, Boone staged a suicide mission against the Legate.
AID00142033	Fighting as he wished he would've fought on the day of his wife's death, he brought down scores of Legionaries before being caught.
AID00142034	Before his crucifixion, he was brought before the Legate, who expressed his admiration for Boone's reckless abandon.
AID00142035	Boone spat tobacco in his eye, for all of Caesar's armies to see.
AID00142036	I really don't have time for this.
AID00142037	In that case, don't mind me. Carry on.
AID00142038	Screw this, I'm leaving.
AID00142039	No need to get angry about this. Look, I'll let you take the test again if you want. Go and clear your mind and come back, and we'll try again.
AID00142040	
AID00142041	[SUCCEEDED] Now I know you're from the NCR! None of the vagrants around here would even think of giving their money away.
AID00142042	We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
AID00142043	Best of luck to you.
AID00142044	I've got 100 caps here that all say I'm a loyal NCR citizen.
AID00142045	[FAILED] Look, we're trying to help people here. Put away your money.
AID00142046	Would, say, 10 caps maybe change your mind?
AID00142047	Oh come on. I'm betting not everyone in the NCR knows these things.
AID00142048	I'm sure some don't, but the loyal ones do. And that's who we're aiming to help - the loyal ones.
AID00142049	Still, you've got a fire in you that tells me you're one of us and just screwed up, so I'll let you take the test again if you'd like.
AID00142050	No, I'll come back later.
AID00142051	Just stop by and we'll go over it again.
AID00142052	I'm ready.
AID00142053	All right, here we go. First question - who was the most popular president in NCR history, Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
AID00142054	Can't I try again?
AID00142055	I'm not really supposed to administer the test more than once, but what the hell? You're the only new face I've seen today.
AID00142056	Did you want to take it again right away?
AID00142057	A two-tailed lion.
AID00142058	A two-headed snake.
AID00142059	An eagle.
AID00142060	Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
AID00142061	A two-headed bear.
AID00142062	Good. You passed with flying colors. I told you it'd be fine. I expect you're wanting to know about that meal then, huh?
AID00142063	We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
AID00142064	Best of luck to you.
AID00142065	Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
AID00142066	Vault 13.
AID00142067	Aradesh.
AID00142068	Shady Sands.
AID00142069	Right. Fine then, last question -  What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AID00142070	The Boneyard.
AID00142071	Right. Fine then, last question -  What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AID00142072	Peterson.
AID00142073	Tandi.
AID00142074	Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
AID00142075	Tibbett.
AID00142076	Kimball.
AID00142077	Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
AID00142078	I don't really have time for this.
AID00142079	You can always take it later. Stop back anytime.
AID00142080	Lay it on me.
AID00142081	That's a good attitude! I'm sure you'll do fine. These are just a few questions that just about anyone in the NCR would know.
AID00142082	All right, here we go. First question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history - Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
AID00142083	No, I'm not.
AID00142084	Then I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you, sorry.
AID00142085	I sure am.
AID00142086	Now, it's not that I don't believe you, but I'm going to have to give you a little quiz to verify your citizenship status. That okay with you?
AID00142087	Guess I'll just go, then.
AID00142088	Hey, wait up a moment. I can tell you're really upset that you didn't pass the test, so I'll let you take it again any time you want to come back.
AID00142089	It'll be my good deed for the day. Take care now.
AID00142090	No, I'll come back later.
AID00142091	That's fine. I'll let you take the test again whenever you choose to come back.
AID00142092	Yes.
AID00142093	Okay, here we go again. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
AID00142094	Does every NCR citizen really know this stuff?
AID00142095	They should. I guess it's possible that some don't, but this stuff is pretty common knowledge.
AID00142096	Tell you what, come back later and you can take the test again, okay?
AID00142097	Can I take the test again?
AID00142098	I probably shouldn't let you, but I suppose everyone has an bad day now and then. Did you want to take it now?
AID00142099	A two-tailed lion.
AID00142100	A two-headed snake.
AID00142101	An eagle.
AID00142102	I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
AID00142103	A two-headed bear.
AID00142104	Very good! I'm happy to say you've proven you're definitely an NCR citizen, which means you qualify for our program.
AID00142105	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
AID00142106	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
AID00142107	I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
AID00142108	Vault 13.
AID00142109	Aradesh.
AID00142110	Shady Sands.
AID00142111	Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AID00142112	The Boneyard.
AID00142113	Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AID00142114	Okay, you got me. I'm not an NCR citizen.
AID00142115	Peterson.
AID00142116	Tandi.
AID00142117	Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
AID00142118	Tibbett.
AID00142119	Kimball.
AID00142120	Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
AID00142121	I think I'll pass.
AID00142122	Sorry to have bothered you, then.
AID00142123	Sure.
AID00142124	This'll just take a few moments, and it's all stuff that any real citizen of the NCR knows.
AID00142125	Okay, first question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
AID00142126	I don't have time for this.
AID00142127	Please, don't let me keep you if you have somewhere else to be.
AID00142128	
AID00142129	[SUCCEEDED] You don't look like you're from around here, so I guess I can believe that.
AID00142130	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
AID00142131	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
AID00142132	<Lie> Sure am. I just recently arrived here from California.
AID00142133	[FAILED] I'd like to believe you, but I can't take the risk under current circumstances.
AID00142134	<Lie> Yup, sure am. From NCR, I mean.
AID00142135	No.
AID00142136	In that case, I'm sorry. Our program is only for citizens of the NCR.
AID00142137	Yes.
AID00142138	Ordinarily I'd take your word on that, but lately I've had several people lie and claim to be citizens just to take advantage of our program.
AID00142139	But I've come up with a fairly simple way to tell who's lying. You up to taking a little test?
AID00142140	I don't have that kind of money.
AID00142141	You want the best, you have to be prepared to pay for it.
AID00142142	Nah, let's go.
AID00142143	Lead, and I shall follow.
AID00142144	What can you tell me about the Kings?
AID00142145	Nothing while I'm on the clock. You wanna know about us, head on over to our place. It's the one with the big sign that says "The Kings".
AID00142146	You need anything else?
AID00142147	You can stop following me around now.
AID00142148	Cocky, aren't you? Oh well, your call.
AID00142149	That's okay. I don't really need the company.
AID00142150	That's what they all say. At first.
AID00142151	Why would I want you to tag along with me?
AID00142152	Freeside's a rough and tumble place, but it also belongs to the Kings. You have one of us with you, and everyone else'll give you a wide berth.
AID00142153	Makes the stroll a bit more leisurely.
AID00142154	I don't have that many caps.
AID00142155	That's a shame. Well, come back when you do.
AID00142156	Sure, let's go.
AID00142157	Now you're talking. Here's how it works, I'll keep nearby for the duration of your stay here, and no one messes with you.
AID00142158	As soon as you split Freeside, I'm off. Nothin' too complicated. That said, lead the way, chief.
AID00142159	What can you tell me about the Kings?
AID00142160	Nothing. I'm working right now. You want to know more, head over to our hangout at the center of town. It's kinda hard to miss.
AID00142161	Did you want something else?
AID00142162	No, it's nothing. Let's continue.
AID00142163	Whatever you say.
AID00142164	I don't think I need a bodyguard. You can go.
AID00142165	Suit yourself.
AID00142166	I don't think I need a guard.
AID00142167	You must be new. Your tune'll change, trust me.
AID00142168	Why would I need a bodyguard here?
AID00142169	Freeside's a little dangerous for people traveling alone or in small groups. You go without a guard, you're rolling the dice, you know?
AID00142170	I don't have that kind of money.
AID00142171	Then I guess you're on your own.
AID00142172	Sounds good to me.
AID00142173	Great. As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be hanging out by side. It'll be a blast.
AID00142174	But I'm only sticking around as long as you're in Freeside. You leave, and you'll find me gone as well.
AID00142175	So where to?
AID00142176	None taken. Let's go.
AID00142177	Of course.
AID00142178	I don't need your services any longer.
AID00142179	If you're sure, then I guess I'll take my leave. You know where to find me.
AID00142180	That's one word for it. Let's keep going.
AID00142181	You'll probably be able to think of a few more before you leave, trust me.
AID00142182	It is, but I think I'll explore it on my own from now on.
AID00142183	You're either brave or crazy. Either way, I don't care.
AID00142184	Will do.
AID00142185	I'm glad that you understand. After you.
AID00142186	Actually, I won't be needing your services any longer.
AID00142187	If you say so. I already got paid, after all.
AID00142188	You don't know me? Your boss does - we're very good friends. You should leave.
AID00142189	Wha-? Oh, shit. I heard of you. Look, we didn't mean nothing by this. Just following orders. You want us gone, we're gone - no problem.
AID00142190	<50 caps needed>I don't have the caps.
AID00142191	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
AID00142192	<50 caps> Fix me up.
AID00142193	Not a problem. Just some scrapes here and there.
AID00142194	<75 caps needed>
AID00142195	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
AID00142196	<75 caps> Fix me up.
AID00142197	This shouldn't be too much work. Try to sit still.
AID00142198	Never mind.
AID00142199	If you say so.
AID00142200	<100 caps needed> I don't have the caps.
AID00142201	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
AID00142202	<100 caps> Fix me up.
AID00142203	I can give you something to bite down on if you want. This'll hurt.
AID00142204	Do you have any information on the convicts?
AID00142205	Not much. They've taken to calling themselves Powder Gangers. Mostly because they've taken to using the explosives meant to clear boulders as weapons.
AID00142206	They got organized faster than I would have thought, most of them at least.
AID00142207	Thankfully the small group in town here seem to have split off from the main force, so they aren't getting anything in the way of support.
AID00142208	Tell me about the correctional facility.
AID00142209	Most people just call it NCRCF. That's NCR Correctional Facility.
AID00142210	A little bit ago the convicts there staged a coup, killed the guards that weren't able to escape, and have been ransacking the area since then.
AID00142211	What's the problem with your mission?
AID00142212	The mission isn't a problem. The problem is with supplies. The convicts are better armed and organized than our intel initially suggested.
AID00142213	I'm trying to get some reinforcements here, maybe some guns with some firepower, but... shit... things are just going slow.
AID00142214	Some men stole my package. A man in a checkered suit and some thugs. Did they pass this way?
AID00142215	Well, now that you mention it, a few nights back one of the townies was out scavenging for supplies.
AID00142216	He said he saw a fella with a daisy suit come through with some of them Great Khan misfits. They was talking about a chip.
AID00142217	What was strange about it?
AID00142218	That cowboy robot had us hire six couriers. Each was carrying something a little different. A pair of dice, a chess piece, that kind of stuff.
AID00142219	Last word I had from the office, it looked like payment had been received for the other five jobs. Guess it was just your chip that didn't make it.
AID00142220	First deadbeat we hired to do the job canceled. Hope a storm from the Divide skins him alive. Well, that's where you came in.
AID00142221	To start with, it was a robot that set it up! Came rolling in with a picture of a cowboy on a screen where its face should be.
AID00142222	Had me send a request to the Express office in Hub, for seven couriers to be hired. Each one to carry bric-a-brac, seemed to me!
AID00142223	Playing cards, dice, chess pieces, trinkets like that. Then, next thing I know, he turns around and says he wants six couriers, not seven!
AID00142224	Has me send on the "corrected" order for six couriers along with a bunch of letters and numbers, like some kind of code or something!
AID00142225	Don't ask me what that was about, because I never seen anything like it. Anyways, you must've been Courier 6, then? The Poker Chip?
AID00142226	What can you tell me about this job? <Show Delivery Order>
AID00142227	Oh, so you're talking about one of them packages. That job had strange written all over it. But we couldn't turn down the caps.
AID00142228	Sure. I'll tell you what I know.
AID00142229	I want to ask you some more about the delivery I was supposed to make.
AID00142230	It's about time. Hand them over.
AID00142231	All right.
AID00142232	Caesar has put a lot of trust in you. Be worth it.
AID00142233	HealthQuarter
AID00142234	<Coughing Fit>
AID00142235	Do me a favor. Make sure they bury me in a nice dress.
AID00142236	I knew I should've been an actress.
AID00142237	Ugh. Maybe I should have stayed back in NCR after all.
AID00142238	I could use a syringe of Med-X or two. Or eight.
AID00142239	So this is how it ends.
AID00142240	Maybe it's my time.
AID00142241	Heh... I knew you'd be the death of me.
AID00142242	Think I might've killed my last legionary.
AID00142243	If I die... take care of my salvage.
AID00142244	It's getting... dark.
AID00142245	I'm not doing so well here.
AID00142246	Too stupid to die... but getting there.
AID00142247	On my last legs here.
AID00142248	If I'm going to die, at least pass me some whiskey.
AID00142249	Got more pain in me than blood.
AID00142250	Ain't beat yet.
AID00142251	Don't let them bury me in Vault City.
AID00142252	Feeling a little worse for wear.
AID00142253	These bones are about to give up the ghost, boss.
AID00142254	Ahh, Rafaela... I'll see you soon.
AID00142255	Never thought I'd go out like this....
AID00142256	
AID00142257	No! Grandma won't leave her babies!
AID00142258	Leo, I think we're in very big trouble!
AID00142259	HealthHalf
AID00142260	
AID00142261	Ouch.
AID00142262	
AID00142263	Physician, heal thyself. Guess it's a good thing they invented stims.
AID00142264	Might need to rest soon.
AID00142265	Shot of whiskey might kill the pain.
AID00142266	Wouldn't say no to a Stimpak.
AID00142267	Boss, the pain from my wounds is starting to outweigh the pain from my arthritis.
AID00142268	Little help here, boss?
AID00142269	Wouldn't say no to something to ease the pain. Granted that's usually the case, but right now especially.
AID00142270	Hey boss, is my jaw still attached? Good. Can I get some help to keep it that way?
AID00142271	Oh dear, grandma's not feeling too good!
AID00142272	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten!
AID00142273	Grandma needs her medicine!
AID00142274	
AID00142275	Grandma needs to have a little lie down!
AID00142276	Wake
AID00142277	Oof.
AID00142278	Hmm?
AID00142279	
AID00142280	It is my medical opinion that that could have gone better.
AID00142281	Thursday! Wait... ugh. Dammit.
AID00142282	What'd I miss?
AID00142283	Huh. Alive after all.
AID00142284	<Sighs> Figures.
AID00142285	Feels like a Brahmin kicked me.
AID00142286	Guess that didn't go so well.
AID00142287	Head's ringing like an alarm clock.
AID00142288	Need a drink.
AID00142289	Better than waking up in jail, I guess.
AID00142290	Am I dead? Is this Heaven? Oh. Hi boss. Guess not.
AID00142291	Oof. Boss, take a look around and see if any of my parts are lying around, huh?
AID00142292	I've woken up worse places. Not many, though.
AID00142293	Gah! Petro-Chico Boy! Petro-Chico Boy is here for my chitlins! Oh. Just a dream. Just a dream....
AID00142294	Is grandma's nap over already?
AID00142295	Grandma's head hurts....
AID00142296	ArmorIneffective
AID00142297	Got any armor with less holes in it for me?
AID00142298	I don't have much protection here. Mind helping me out?
AID00142299	What am I wearing? Cardboard?
AID00142300	This armor's gonna get me killed.
AID00142301	Look, I'm dead unless you can get me some real armor.
AID00142302	Shoulda fought naked, it'd hurt less.
AID00142303	Armor's for shit.
AID00142304	They're cutting me up!
AID00142305	Could use sheet metal, not a sheet.
AID00142306	This armor's probably fine. The holes are cosmetic.
AID00142307	This armor's beat up worse than me, boss.
AID00142308	WeaponIneffective
AID00142309	Need a bigger caliber.
AID00142310	Can't punch through.
AID00142311	This is useless.
AID00142312	Might as well be throwing rocks.
AID00142313	Might be time for a weapon upgrade.
AID00142314	Uh... I think I need some more firepower.
AID00142315	You got a bigger gun I can borrow?
AID00142316	I'm not even making a dent with this.
AID00142317	This weapon's on its last legs.
AID00142318	Might as well be shooting blanks!
AID00142319	Maybe I should switch to a squirt gun.
AID00142320	Need something with more kick.
AID00142321	Not even slowing it down!
AID00142322	All I'm doing is pissing him off.
AID00142323	Well, this isn't doing much of anything.
AID00142324	Not sure I'm having any impact here, boss.
AID00142325	Boss, I'm having some... inadequacy issues here. Got a bigger gun I can borrow?
AID00142326	This weapon isn't working! And Leo doesn't like that very much!
AID00142327	Grandma needs a bigger paddle for this behind!
AID00142328	Chop them harder, Leo! Harder! Don't blame the weapon!
AID00142329	WeaponBroke
AID00142330	Weapon's busted.
AID00142331	Can't use this anymore.
AID00142332	This weapon's done for.
AID00142333	I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to.
AID00142334	Need a new weapon.
AID00142335	This weapon's done.
AID00142336	I'm no good without my weapon.
AID00142337	I need a new rifle.
AID00142338	Gotta spare gun handy?
AID00142339	Weapon's done for.
AID00142340	Piece. Of. Shit.
AID00142341	What a piece of junk!
AID00142342	My weapon broke. Probably my fault.
AID00142343	You got a spare piece, boss, or do I have to break out the tubing?
AID00142344	Leo broke another weapon! I told you you hit too hard, Leo!
AID00142345	Grandma needs another weapon, pumpkin!
AID00142346	Grandma's weapon broke, and there are still backsides that need paddling!
AID00142347	NoAmmo
AID00142348	Spare some ammo?
AID00142349	All out of ammunition.
AID00142350	If you could spare any ammunition, that would be really terrific.
AID00142351	That's the last of the ammo.
AID00142352	Empty.
AID00142353	Reloading! Wait, no, I'm out!
AID00142354	Trigger's willing, chamber's empty.
AID00142355	No more ammo.
AID00142356	Firing dry here.
AID00142357	I'm out.
AID00142358	I'm all out, boss!
AID00142359	I can throw the gun at 'em if you want, boss.
AID00142360	Could I trouble you for some bullets, boss?
AID00142361	You know those little lead things that fly really fast and hurt people? I need some.
AID00142362	Sweetie, grandma needs some more ammunition!
AID00142363	If I don't get some ammunition soon, Leo's going to start chopping!
AID00142364	Didn't grandma tell you it's good to share, sweetheart? Especially ammo?
AID00142365	UsedDoctorBag
AID00142366	That's better. Maybe I should've been a surgeon.
AID00142367	I'm fine now.
AID00142368	Will the medical wonders of the post-apocalyptic world never cease?
AID00142369	Good as new.
AID00142370	Patched up. Let's get back to the fight.
AID00142371	Didn't even leave a scar.
AID00142372	All stitched up.
AID00142373	Prefer a shot of whiskey, but...
AID00142374	That makes me feel young again. No, wait, that's just the Med-X talking.
AID00142375	There. Now my limbs should stay attached a while longer.
AID00142376	That should fix the damage.
AID00142377	Grandma's feeling much better now.
AID00142378	Oh, that's much nicer.
AID00142379	Better than a long hot soak in an oatmeal bath!
AID00142380	Crippled
AID00142381	I'm gonna need some new limbs.
AID00142382	I could use a Doctor's Bag if you have any handy.
AID00142383	Need a medic.
AID00142384	Can't feel all my limbs.
AID00142385	Tagged me, need a doctor bag.
AID00142386	Not firing on all pistons here.
AID00142387	A doctor's bag and some whiskey, if you don't mind.
AID00142388	Gonna lose a limb if I don't get some meds.
AID00142389	If I get gangrene before we find a doctor...
AID00142390	Grandma's limbs aren't doing too well, pumpkin.
AID00142391	Yes it hurts, Leo, but the doctors can fix me right up!
AID00142392	KOed
AID00142393	
AID00142394

AID00142401	That helps.
AID00142402	Much better.
AID00142403	Sweet as roses.
AID00142404	Getting my second wind here.
AID00142405	Mmm, now that feels good.
AID00142406	Whew.
AID00142407	Ooh, that eases the aches. Not all of them, but some.
AID00142408	Ahh, that feels better. I might not die for a while yet.
AID00142409	Much better.
AID00142410	Oh, grandma feels much better now.
AID00142411	That's much better, isn't it, Leo?
AID00142412	Ahh....
AID00142413	OnFire
AID00142414	
AID00142415	Frenzy
AID00142416	
AID00142417	Poison
AID00142418	I'm getting... woozy.
AID00142419	Argh. Poison.
AID00142420	Hmm. Might need some antidote here.
AID00142421	Yep. That's poison.
AID00142422	Feel... weak all of a sudden.
AID00142423	Head's spinning - must've got stung.
AID00142424	I need a snakebite kit, fast.
AID00142425	Well. This isn't good. Think I've been poisoned, boss.
AID00142426	That one... had a little kick to it. The poisonous kind of kick.
AID00142427	Boss, I got a poison situation here!
AID00142428	Grandma's feeling woozy - be a dear and fetch her a poison antidote?
AID00142429	Either grandma needs to cut back on grandpa's special moonshine, or she's been poisoned.
AID00142430	FollowersOverburdened
AID00142431	Hey, I can't really move, now. But I'll follow you in spirit.
AID00142432	Gonna be hard covering you when I can't move my legs.
AID00142433	I'm not exactly in Power Armor over here, so why don't you help lighten my load a bit?
AID00142434	[Rex is overburdened and is having difficulty keeping up with you.]
AID00142435	Carrying too much shit to move.
AID00142436	Pinned down here carrying your bags.
AID00142437	I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off of me so I can move a little more easily.
AID00142438	Need to lighten my load.
AID00142439	What did you give me, bricks?
AID00142440	Hey, don't worry about it, boss. The decrepit old man can easily carry all your stuff for you. Really.
AID00142441	Didn't your mother ever tell you it's polite to help an old lady carry her bags?
AID00142442	I want to discuss other things.
AID00142443	Ooo. Got any juicy gossip?
AID00142444	Sure.
AID00142445	You didn't go with her?
AID00142446	No. Couldn't bring myself to leave everyone else behind. Couldn't convince her to stay, either.
AID00142447	I'd hoped love would be enough to influence her decision, but it wasn't. We were both too stubborn.
AID00142448	I don't know where she is now, but I'm sure she's moved on. I still think about her, though. Once in a while.
AID00142449	What happened?
AID00142450	She left the Brotherhood. Wanted to put some distance between herself and her parents.
AID00142451	Since our membership isn't open to outsiders, some members think that obligates all of us to procreate.
AID00142452	You can guess which camp her parents belonged to.
AID00142453	Ever been in love?
AID00142454	Ever been nosy?
AID00142455	I was, once. We were pretty young, but I like to think it was love.
AID00142456	Are you well respected among other members of the Brotherhood?
AID00142457	If you take trying to keep me as far away from Hidden Valley as possible because I ask too many difficult questions as a sign of respect, oh yeah.
AID00142458	That's not to say I don't get along with them. I just think they don't know what to do with me sometimes.
AID00142459	VDialogueVeronicaDamOutcomeBranch
AID00142460	Not sure what my parents would think of me fighting for the NCR.
AID00142461	But for New Vegas it seemed like this was the best chance at stability. I don't regret it.
AID00142462	Never sided with a group of marauders before. But I think the Brotherhood stands a better chance against them than they did against the NCR.
AID00142463	That gives me some hope.
AID00142464	For some reason, it warms my heart that we fought for the kooky old geezer. Guess he reminds me of someone.
AID00142465	Independent New Vegas. If that isn't redundant, I don't know what is.
AID00142466	But I like its chances.
AID00142467	What did you do when you were with the Enclave?
AID00142468	Heavy weapons trooper. Nothing better than hosing down a target with an excess of bullets and laser fire.
AID00142469	By the time I got through with things, not much was left standing. Any morons who didn't run when they saw me coming got what they deserved.
AID00142470	Back then, it was war. If we'd been on the winning side, I'd be called a hero.
AID00142471	You make it sound like avoiding innocent deaths was uncommon in the Enclave.
AID00142472	I'm sorry to say that it was. Civilian casualties was acceptable and sometimes... encouraged. My former squadmate Moreno didn't need encouraging.
AID00142473	Moreno and I might've killed each other if Captain Kreger hadn't been there to pull us apart.
AID00142474	What did you do when you were with the Enclave?
AID00142475	Squad marksman. I'm pretty proud of the fact that I never killed a single soul who wasn't trying to kill me or one of my team first.
AID00142476	Goodbye.
AID00142477	Be seeing you. Maybe.
AID00142478	How did you like flying vertibirds for the Enclave?
AID00142479	I never was happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
AID00142480	There were more than a few missions where I took the scenic route home just so I could stay in the air. Caught hell for it every time, but worth it!
AID00142481	Some of the things we did were questionable, I know. That's just how it was back then. Figure I've done enough good to make up for any sins, anyhow.
AID00142482	I'd like to know more about your former squad.
AID00142483	I was the officer in charge, and Johnson and Moreno were my heavy hitters. Henry handled tech things, and Whitman flew the chopper.
AID00142484	Johnson and Moreno never got along, and I had my hands full keeping those two apart some days.
AID00142485	It was a difference in philosophy, mostly. "Mercy" was not part of Moreno's vocabulary.
AID00142486	What happened to the Enclave oil rig and Navarro?
AID00142487	Internal sabotage took down the oil rig - never did get the full story. The NCR took out Navarro, saying we posed a threat to the region.
AID00142488	Tell me about the old days with the Enclave.
AID00142489	I miss those days sometimes. We all had a purpose, you know? I admit that some of the folks in charge were pretty ruthless.
AID00142490	The rest of us, though - we were just trying to civilize things. The NCR was still new and it didn't look like they'd last all that long.
AID00142491	Then, we lost the oil rig and shortly after that, the base at Navarro. Nobody left except us Remnants.
AID00142492	I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to you. Well, not really.
AID00142493	Like I'd hang around to find out!
AID00142494	How long have you lived in Westside?
AID00142495	Couple of years now. I was a trader for awhile, but got tired of all the walking. Westside was a good place to settle down as any.
AID00142496	So what did you do before you were retired?
AID00142497	I was a soldier. Why do you even care? I came out here to forget about the past, so quit bringing it up.
AID00142498	VCampGolfHanlonRepBranch
AID00142499	You must be the courier folks have been talking about. Word on the radio is that someone wronged you back in Goodsprings.
AID00142500	The Mojave has a way of burning decent people up, but it sounds like you've done right by the NCR. It's appreciated. Now what can I do for you?
AID00142501	I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
AID00142502	If you're going to be associating with rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
AID00142503	I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
AID00142504	If the rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
AID00142505	I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting before. What can I do for you?
AID00142506	I'll talk to her, then.
AID00142507	The training might take several hours, so keep that in mind.
AID00142508	I already know how to wear Power Armor.
AID00142509	Good. That'll save us some time.
AID00142510	What do you know about the dam?
AID00142511	Well, the dam here is the key to helping the NCR make the world a better place.
AID00142512	With the power from the dam we can help the people here and back home have a better quality of life.
AID00142513	We can't trust the Legion or Mr. House to do the same. The NCR is the only one looking out for the people. And we need the dam to do that.
AID00142514	And I pity the people that try to take it from us.
AID00142515	What are your thoughts about the Legion?
AID00142516	They're a bunch of evil savages if you ask me. We're out here trying to save these good people from being enslaved by those bastards.
AID00142517	I hope we kill 'em all.
AID00142518	How do you feel about the NCR being out here?
AID00142519	The NCR is out here to make the world a better place. For those out here and for all those back home. I'm glad I can be a part of that.
AID00142520	Let's go back to my other questions.
AID00142521	Make it quick.
AID00142522	<Speech Check>
AID00142523	I guess I can make an exception, just for you.
AID00142524	I completely understand, but I am working for the good of the NCR too.
AID00142525	It's still against regulations, I can't help you.
AID00142526	Come on! Who's going to know?
AID00142527	<Reputation Check>
AID00142528	Well, that is great and all, but it's really against regulations.
AID00142529	Not even to a friend of the NCR?
AID00142530	I'm not here to make money, I'm here to watch the NCR supplies for the dam and that means no supplies for you.
AID00142531	Come on! Don't you want to make a few caps?
AID00142532	I have some questions about the NCR.
AID00142533	I guess I can trust you. What would you like to know?
AID00142534	Sure, what would you like to know?
AID00142535	I'm not required to answer questions from a civilian and I don't trust you enough.
AID00142536	Go bug someone else with your questions.
AID00142537	Tell me about yourself.
AID00142538	I guess I can spare a minute or two for you. Things are a little slow at the moment anyway.
AID00142539	Me? I've been in the military my entire life. It's a family sort of thing. My father served, my brothers serve, and I serve.
AID00142540	I've had the honor of serving all over the NCR and now I get to be out on the front lines as the NCR comes out east to help these folks here.
AID00142541	Once we get rid of the Legion, this will be a better place for everyone, and I'm proud to be a part of that.
AID00142542	I'm on duty here. I don't have time to chit-chat.
AID00142543	I'd like to purchase some supplies.
AID00142544	Sure thing.
AID00142545	Unfortunately for you, I'm not authorized to trade with you. It's against regulations.
AID00142546	Why is the Brotherhood interested in Nevada?
AID00142547	It was the Dam, really. We'd heard rumors it was working. Figured we could claim it, put it to use.
AID00142548	And... it may also have been partly that our Elder at the time had worn out his welcome.
AID00142549	Didn't end up mattering. We got sidetracked at HELIOS One and the NCR took the Dam in the meantime. We're still after it, though. In theory.
AID00142550	What are you doing in here?
AID00142551	Well, a deputy isn't much good without a sheriff. So I figured I'd come in here and protect these good people until someone finds us a new one.
AID00142552	Why do you keep calling them Gangsters? I thought they were called Powder Gangers.
AID00142553	Gangers, gangsters, all sounds like trouble to me.
AID00142554	Didn't your friend just say so?
AID00142555	Yeah, if he vouches for you, I guess I can trust you.
AID00142556	You're not hiding something from me, are you?
AID00142557	What? No! I thought you were supposed to be here to help, and here you are making accusations.
AID00142558	VFSRoyTalksToPlayer
AID00142559	The boy means well, but he's dumb as a mutant sometimes.
AID00142560	VFSRoyCallsWayneStupid
AID00142561	He probably said "lieutenant", Wayne.
AID00142562	Your friend looks like he's in bad shape.
AID00142563	Yeah, the docs say he's going to be laid up for a while, assuming he doesn't get any worse.
AID00142564	Sorry, didn't mean to intrude.
AID00142565	You were just curious. No harm in that. I'm just worried sick about my friend here.
AID00142566	I wanted to speak to you about the Great Khans.
AID00142567	What precisely about them did you wish to discuss?
AID00142568	Should I leave you two alone?
AID00142569	Naw, I'm just happy to see my pup back on his feet and happy. I can't thank you enough for this.
AID00142570	Hopefully, he's been making himself useful as a way of paying you back. But where are my manners, did you need something?
AID00142571	I don't have to give him back just yet, do I?
AID00142572	No no, you can hold onto him for a little while longer, I think. You deserve that much at least, for what you've done.
AID00142573	But aside from the good news about my Rex, was there something you wanted?
AID00142574	He sure did.
AID00142575	You're a man of your word, no doubt about it. I can't thank you enough.
AID00142576	If you want, hold onto Rex for a little while longer. I'm sure he'd enjoy that. Was there anything else you wanted?
AID00142577	You know, I really don't pay attention to him, so your guess is as good as mine.
AID00142578	I expect you to treat my Rexie with a little more care. I'm expecting him back now, you hear?
AID00142579	Now, was there something you wanted to talk about?
AID00142580	Rex died in battle, saving my life.
AID00142581	I hate to tell you this, but Rex is dead.
AID00142582	That's... that's terrible. I hope the poor little guy gave as good as he got. He always was a fighter.
AID00142583	Why I remember one time when he... do you mind if we talk about something else?
AID00142584	
AID00142585	[SUCCEEDED] O-Of course not! We're here to serve the good citizens of the NCR. Please, head on through.
AID00142586	You already let me in the other night! Do all of us civilians look the same to you soldier boys?
AID00142587	[SUCCEEDED] If you're here to see the Major, then I suppose it's all right. Head on through.
AID00142588	I'm here to see Major Kieran on urgent business. Please let me pass.
AID00142589	[FAILED] Since you put it like that, no. Not unless you know the password. Do you know the password?
AID00142590	Come on, guys, you can let me in, right? Right?
AID00142591	I'll leave things here to you, then.
AID00142592	Be safe, human. And thanks again for everything.
AID00142593	With Tabitha gone, what will happen to this place?
AID00142594	Who knows? It might stay abandoned, get used as a base for raiders, or even become another colony for mutants.
AID00142595	The future is not written, human, and it is foolish to squint at what cannot be seen.
AID00142596	BMNeilDistractsNightkin
AID00142597	There's a human down the path. Tabitha's orders are to kill all human intruders. Go!
AID00142598	They were distributing supplies down by the old train station, but I dealt with them.
AID00142599	I'll send some guys to check out your story, but that's some good news for a change.
AID00142600	Word will probably spread about this, and quickly. The NCR'll know not to come around these parts if they know what's good for 'em.
AID00142601	You've helped us plenty, so I'll tell you what. Just this once, name whatever you want, and if I can make it happen, it's done.
AID00142602	Don't rush it, though. Toss it around in your head a little. You only get one favor from The King.
AID00142603	Nevermind.
AID00142604	Sorry about that, friend.
AID00142605	I changed my mind. I'm not going inside, either.
AID00142606	Thanks. Wasn't wild about sticking around here on my own.
AID00142607	Okay.
AID00142608	Don't take too long, all right?
AID00142609	Is there someplace you wanted me to take you?
AID00142610	Nowhere specific. I just know there are a lot of groups who're actually doing well for themselves out here.
AID00142611	I want to understand how and why. See them at work.
AID00142612	VDialogueVeronicaFarmTechReact
AID00142613	See? Just because it doesn't shoot lasers doesn't mean it's not worth looking into. We could do amazing things with this data.
AID00142614	VDialogueVeronicaPulseGunReact
AID00142615	Huh. Figured it'd have more buttons and dials and stuff, you know? Oh, well. It's still the electronic equivalent of a disease from Gomorrah.
AID00142616	VDialogueVeronicaBoSDamReact
AID00142617	Oh, God, I don't know if I can do this.
AID00142618	Hey, the gang's all here! Let's give the Mojave something to remember us by.
AID00142619	I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad you're here.
AID00142620	Hey, the gang's all here!
AID00142621	VDialogueVeronicaHVEntranceEstranged
AID00142622	Hey. I, uh, I can't go in with you. I'll wait here, okay?
AID00142623	VDialogueVeronicaBoSThreatReact
AID00142624	Sorry about that. Just because I love them doesn't mean some of them aren't assholes.
AID00142625	Could you help me craft something?
AID00142626	Step into my office.
AID00142627	Anything else?
AID00142628	Yeah. I've been taking things apart and putting them back together since before I said my first word.
AID00142629	You want to build something, talk to me, and we can do it right there on the spot. Workbenches are for novices.
AID00142630	Who knows, I might even be able to show you a Brotherhood trick or two.
AID00142631	Could you could teach me to punch better?
AID00142632	Not right now.
AID00142633	You sure? Some other time, then.
AID00142634	Sure, teach me.
AID00142635	All right, put 'em up. Let's see what you got.
AID00142636	VDialogueVeronicaULDressReceived
AID00142637	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, no, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
AID00142638	I... wish I had something to give you. I- wait! What about punching? That's the gift that keeps on giving.
AID00142639	I could work on your punching with you, if you like. Show you how to counter like a Scribe.
AID00142640	VDialogueVeronicaULDressAcquire
AID00142641	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
AID00142642	VDialogueVeronicaDressAcquire
AID00142643	Hey, a dress! Thank you! I'm totally trying this on later.
AID00142644	Aw, you shouldn't have! It's just my taste. Thank you.
AID00142645	VDialogueVeronicaULDressReact
AID00142646	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Look what they're wearing! I've only seen dresses like those in my dreams. And even then I couldn't afford them.
AID00142647	Got the whiskey, let's do this.
AID00142648	All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
AID00142649	Here's a dozen bottles, let's go.
AID00142650	All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
AID00142651	I'll get a dozen bottles of whiskey and be back.
AID00142652	I'll be waiting, then. And training.
AID00142653	What will you do now?
AID00142654	No idea. Maybe... head back West? Though the idea of heading back there with my tail between my legs isn't appealing.
AID00142655	I'll be going now.
AID00142656	Take care now.
AID00142657	I had something else I wanted to ask.
AID00142658	What will you do now?
AID00142659	That's the question I been asking myself.
AID00142660	Helped out Jackson and cleared the road North.
AID00142661	Guess that settles that, then.
AID00142662	I may be honest, but at least I'm not blinded by pride.
AID00142663	That's fair. But there's been that voice inside me saying the same thing, and whiskey wasn't killing it.
AID00142664	Give me that paper, I'll put my name to it. No sense trying to hold the past between your fingers when it's nothing but dirt.
AID00142665	Who believes in holding on to a dead caravan?
AID00142666	Me, that's who. I'm not going to let it go just yet. There... there might be some survivors... or...
AID00142667	Who am I kidding. There's nothing left, and I wouldn't be here, drinking in some shitty bar in the ass end of nowhere if it wasn't true.
AID00142668	I wanted to talk to you more about buying your caravan.
AID00142669	If you think staying here's any better...
AID00142670	[SUCCEEDED] That... that's a good point, it's the caravan clearance that's got me stuck here. I'm sure this bar's getting tired of propping me up.
AID00142671	This Outpost is the last place you want to be trapped.
AID00142672	[FAILED] I got a bar, men who don't say a word, and plenty of whiskey, I'm fine.
AID00142673	Are you sure?
AID00142674	Look, I know you came all this way, and that takes some drive, especially these days.
AID00142675	Just doesn't feel right, trading history for a slip of paper.
AID00142676	Never mind. I'll be going.
AID00142677	You take care now.
AID00142678	Forget it, then. I had something else I wanted to ask.
AID00142679	So what... you're just going to keep it?
AID00142680	[SUCCEEDED] What did you just say to me? Cause you sure as hell got my attention now.
AID00142681	If you made the caravan, you're responsible for killing it.
AID00142682	[FAILED] Yeah, yeah I will, and you sure as hell aren't taking it. Can't believe I was even listening to you.
AID00142683	Whatever gets the job done. Sign here.
AID00142684	Let's just say I prefer when both sides are happy.
AID00142685	Just insuring future work with the Crimson Caravan.
AID00142686	Which means they're paying you to rebuild Cassidy Caravans, not sell it.
AID00142687	After Cassidy Caravans gets renamed, just start it up again.
AID00142688	The Crimson Caravan will most likely change the name once they buy it.
AID00142689	So you're telling me, I could take this money you're offering, give them nothing, and then go on to strike up another caravan, same as before?
AID00142690	What kind of fucking negotiator are you? Hope Alice knows the kind of snake she's got working for her.
AID00142691	Far from it, to turn down the original terms.
AID00142692	All right, it's a deal, hand over that paper. Hnh. Can't believe I'm parting with it.
AID00142693	All right... there you go, caravan's yours. Feel kind of relieved, actually. Guess I didn't realize how much I was carrying around with just the name.
AID00142694	I think you're a realist, and know a good offer when you see one.
AID00142695	That amount's enough to start a new caravan... with the old name.
AID00142696	Old name? What old name?
AID00142697	Maybe... there's something else we could trade?
AID00142698	[SUCCEEDED] You challenging me? Serious now.
AID00142699	All right, you come here, armed with whiskey, we'll make a sport of it.
AID00142700	And none of that radioactive shit, I'm talking whiskey, not Dixon Whiskey - whiskey.
AID00142701	I'm not going to offer money, I wanted to drink for it.
AID00142702	[FAILED] You are definitely barking up the wrong bar stool. Whatever you're suggesting, not interested.
AID00142703	It's just a name, this - this is money.
AID00142704	[SUCCEEDED] You're obviously putting your money where your mouth is - on top of that offer letter, that is a lot of caps.
AID00142705	Still... what makes you think that's enough. What, you think I'm cheap?
AID00142706	I'm prepared to offer you the terms, plus 750 caps.
AID00142707	[FAILED] "Just a name?" You obviously don't know me at all to sweet talk me like that.
AID00142708	You take your letter, pay my respects to Alice, then kindly go fuck yourself.
AID00142709	I have the offer letter here, the terms are fair.
AID00142710	Alice McLafferty, eh? No, I see the zeroes... and I know she's good for them.
AID00142711	Still, it's not about the money. Dad'd spin like a twister if he ever heard I sold our name for anything.
AID00142712	So even if you have nothing, you won't sell?
AID00142713	If someone came up to you and offered you a thousand caps for your name, would you take it?
AID00142714	Actually, you know what, fuck it, I don't want to hear your answer anyway.
AID00142715	Point is, I made the caravan what it is, it's mine.
AID00142716	You haven't even seen the offer yet.
AID00142717	Why not?
AID00142718	Wait, what happened to your caravan?
AID00142719	Mojave happened - hit by raiders packing some heavy firepower. Can't believe the Crimson Caravan haven't heard.
AID00142720	So if you want to buy all of Cassidy Caravans, you're looking at it - and what I got in my pockets. Still, as little as that is, not looking to sell.
AID00142721	Crimson Caravan sent me, they want to buy out your caravan.
AID00142722	They want to buy Cassidy Caravans? Don't they know it's burned to ash?
AID00142723	No... even times being what they are, not sure I'm looking to sell, even for all the whiskey in Reno.
AID00142724	<Storage Node for Variables: Do Not Translate.>
AID00142725	Still, Jackson's not letting me out of his sight as long as there's still trouble up North.
AID00142726	You settle things with him, help the others around here, too, I'll sign the paper if it means getting out of here.
AID00142727	Walking the Mojave with you can't be any worse than here, that's for sure. All right, I'm in.
AID00142728	Now, onto settle accounts with Gloria Van Graff. Putting her down would suit me just fine.
AID00142729	Might be a little tougher than the Crimson Caravan - Van Graffs are like a nest of rattlers, and the guns they've got are Brotherhood-caliber.
AID00142730	Now, onto settle accounts with Alice McLafferty. Putting her down - that would suit me just fine.
AID00142731	Can't wait to see the look on her face when I show up. She'll know why.
AID00142732	Payback's a bitch, ladies, and between Gloria and Alice, that settles accounts, as far as I'm concerned.
AID00142733	Hope they're in hell right now, blinking, trying to figure out where they fucked up.
AID00142734	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
AID00142735	VFSJeanBaptisteGreetsCass
AID00142736	Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste, and you're about to stop being a pain in my ass.
AID00142737	I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do it.
AID00142738	That's just fucking great. I knew you didn't have what it takes from the start, but would Glory listen to me? No.
AID00142739	Still, my sister has plans for you, so I'll cut you a break. You bring the girl here, and I'll take care of the fun part. That's fair, eh?
AID00142740	Whtttchumnn
AID00142741	When I mmmet you I thought you were thbiggst bitch.
AID00142742	Awwww. Now ain't that sweet.
AID00142743	I totally love you and your little hat.
AID00142744	I think... think my liver's trying to crawl out my ass.
AID00142745	Yeah... well, feel a... a little dizzy.
AID00142746	You know you put up a good fight. I'm impressed.
AID00142747	Thing is, I really just wanted an excuse to drink - should last me for a while.
AID00142748	Might just be the whiskey talking, but I think I might feel a whole lot better leaving the caravan business behind me...
AID00142749	Makes me a little teary-eyed, but now I've got a bottle to put 'em in. Hand over that paper, I'll put my name to it.
AID00142750	Hmm? MmmMmmm.
AID00142751	I flll fnnne.
AID00142752	<Laughs> All right, all right, you just hang on to the bar here... that's it.
AID00142753	Didn't take you for the toughest courier in the West when you walked in, but you walked all the way to the Outpost, so at least you have guts.
AID00142754	Still feel a little parched.
AID00142755	You want... want to drink more?
AID00142756	I feel great, actually. Another?
AID00142757	Another?!
AID00142758	No... no, I... you got me beat. I'm done, caravan's yours. Give me that paper, I'll... phew... put my name to it.
AID00142759	We haven't finished all the bottles yet.
AID00142760	Uh... as long as we don't share the same bottle.
AID00142761	Wouldn't suggest otherwise.
AID00142762	Be my guest.
AID00142763	Oh my fucking god... get away from me, all three... four of you, don't need your...
AID00142764	Oh god, I think I'm going to be sick, and you... you look fine.
AID00142765	Well, guess you're a little tougher than I thought... still, looks like you're feeling it, eh, slick?
AID00142766	You... you all right? You took a little spill there, one moment you're smiling, then...
AID00142767	Had some questions I wanted to ask you.
AID00142768	Just passing through.
AID00142769	Looking to join up with me again?
AID00142770	Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
AID00142771	How about a drink instead?
AID00142772	"How about a drink?" How about a couple, is what you mean.
AID00142773	Was looking for someone worth my time, I was mistaken.
AID00142774	A sober woman might take insult at that. Me, I might just bust you one.
AID00142775	If you ain't drinking, then leave. If you're making to see if I'm an easy lay, I got a caravan shotgun that'll cure that desire right quick.
AID00142776	Surprised you can see me from that deep in the bottle.
AID00142777	Deep? Ain't deep by half. Closed down the bar yesterday, going to close it again today - rinse and repeat.
AID00142778	Not yet.
AID00142779	Well, let me know when it is.
AID00142780	Neil told me about this town.
AID00142781	Lot of the mutants here found out about Jacobstown because of Neil. Our isolation works against us sometimes.
AID00142782	Can you teach me the Praetorian unarmed technique?
AID00142783	You have a poor reputation in the Legion. It wouldn't be acceptable for me to teach you anything right now.
AID00142784	[FAILED] I've watched you move, and I can tell you simply don't have the skill to learn the technique.
AID00142785	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. This will take some time, and I'm not a forgiving teacher.
AID00142786	I've noticed that you don't carry a gun.
AID00142787	It's a tradition in the Praetorians to specialize in unarmed combat because weapons can break or jam when needed most.
AID00142788	However, our unarmed techniques favor offense over defense. We can charge the enemy and flatten him with our first strike before he can react.
AID00142789	Would Chet be willing to give us his supplies?
AID00142790	I don't think "give" is in Chet's vocabulary. Even with the town at stake, he'd still make you barter with him.
AID00142791	What's with the soldiers?
AID00142792	Not yet.
AID00142793	Well, if you can help, I'd appreciate it. Need to get these caravans moving.
AID00142794	Haven't been to Nipton yet.
AID00142795	If there were any survivors, they're going to be in the Town Hall. If you can get inside, let me know if you find anyone.
AID00142796	The children here don't seem interested in guns.
AID00142797	Few children are, especially when they are born during a relatively safe time in our history.
AID00142798	Our children are protected from the outside world, but they are not ignorant of the dangers it holds.
AID00142799	I think I could improve your curriculum.
AID00142800	Really, Outsider? I'm open to ideas.
AID00142801	Good to hear. The wasteland is no place for children.
AID00142802	I agree. That is why we do everything we can to teach the children from birth to defend themselves and serve the tribe.
AID00142803	What happens when they come of age?
AID00142804	All of us are trained in combat and farming from a very early age. When we reach adulthood, we serve in whatever capacity we are best suited.
AID00142805	Goodbye.
AID00142806	Bye.
AID00142807	I can spare 2.
AID00142808	Thanks.
AID00142809	I can spare 4.
AID00142810	Thanks.
AID00142811	Actually. I can't spare anything right now.
AID00142812	That's too bad. I was hoping to melt some more down for machining.
AID00142813	I can spare 2 more.
AID00142814	I can spare 3 more.
AID00142815	Just take all of it.
AID00142816	Okay, I'll let you know if I find a pressure cooker.
AID00142817	Great, that's all I need to get the rebreather to work right. I don't think you'd want to start breathing water halfway down.
AID00142818	Let's talk about something else.
AID00142819	What do you have in mind?
AID00142820	That's a bit cryptic, Beatrix.
AID00142821	Hey, who doesn't enjoy a little pinch and squeal every once in a while?
AID00142822	Sounds like you're a bit of a dom, Beatrix.
AID00142823	You should know I've been helpful to the Followers, so come clean about White if you know something.
AID00142824	Some of the other Followers mentioned you. All right - the truth, then.
AID00142825	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
AID00142826	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
AID00142827	It was easy to figure out that the NCR water shortage points to you - save me some time, will you?
AID00142828	Fair enough. Since you seem to have pieced it together, I won't insult you by denying it any further.
AID00142829	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
AID00142830	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
AID00142831	I thought you said I didn't have to kill her.
AID00142832	Yeah, if you brought her back here. Is she behind you or something? 'Cause I don't see her.
AID00142833	Now stop stalling, get out there, and do your fucking job already. Sheesh.
AID00142834	Can we discuss this another time?
AID00142835	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you - I've probably got three, maybe four months before I keel over.
AID00142836	What are you talking about?
AID00142837	That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
AID00142838	If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
AID00142839	What is it about Ranger Andy that reminds you of yourself?
AID00142840	Is that what you did?
AID00142841	Would it surprise you to know I used to be a gunslinging adventurer?
AID00142842	We're not just talking about Ranger Andy, are we?
AID00142843	Not really, boss, no.
AID00142844	Why do you care so much, anyways?
AID00142845	He reminds me of me in some ways.
AID00142846	It sounds like maybe you're talking about yourself there, Raul.
AID00142847	It's a question I've asked myself often enough.
AID00142848	Why do I get the impression this is more personal to you?
AID00142849	I guess it reminds me of my own life.
AID00142850	You're talking about the Great War? What do you remember about it?
AID00142851	It might seem harsh, but a soldier can't do his job properly with those limitations.
AID00142852	You're preaching to the choir here, boss. Once a man's prime is behind him, he should let it go.
AID00142853	With those injuries, he's nothing but a drain on resources. He should retire.
AID00142854	That's what I love about you, boss; the pity you show for the less fortunate than you.
AID00142855	The NCR put a lot of time and money into his training. He owes it to them to use it however he can.
AID00142856	Even if he can't use them any more? Isn't that like asking you to come up with one of your brilliant schemes after suffering a crippling head wound?
AID00142857	Err, another one, I mean?
AID00142858	I think it's good that he's so devoted to his duty. More people should act that way.
AID00142859	You think so, boss? Because I remember a time when a lot of people stuck to their duty no matter what.
AID00142860	It ended with nuclear bombs falling on my hometown.
AID00142861	I don't have time for your useless chatter.
AID00142862	Sure, boss. I know you've got a lot on your mind, what with all that wandering the empty desert wastes.
AID00142863	Not now, Raul.
AID00142864	Okay, boss. When you feel like availing yourself of my centuries of experience, you know where I'll be.
AID00142865	Sure, what's on your mind?
AID00142866	Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
AID00142867	Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
AID00142868	You think he did the right thing?
AID00142869	You could come with me.
AID00142870	Go with you? And why the hell would I do that.
AID00142871	You got one too many by my count.
AID00142872	Fine - wasn't planning to share anyway.
AID00142873	Calm down. I had some questions.
AID00142874	What's the problem?
AID00142875	My father had heart problems, and it ran down the family tree to me.
AID00142876	Not looking to have my heart skip its last beat, even if I considered putting that junk in my system, which I don't.
AID00142877	Just needed a little pick-me-up.
AID00142878	Well, keep it away from me, won't have anything to do with it.
AID00142879	Tell me about your Dad.
AID00142880	Where'd you get that pendant?
AID00142881	Gift from my Dad, along with my name. Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
AID00142882	Mom said he got the name out of some Old World book about dirt pilgrims. Name sure sounds sweet, though.
AID00142883	Anyway, pendant's a little rose. Originally thought it was one of Mom's tribal necklaces, but no, came from Dad.
AID00142884	Any idea why he went East?
AID00142885	Not a clue. When he left, I was too in my crib to understand why, and around the time Mom passed, I was too into my teens to listen.
AID00142886	Got his name, got this pendant, and that's about it.
AID00142887	Tell me about your Dad.
AID00142888	Not much to tell. He ended up walking East one day when I was young and never came back. Not a family deserter like some, though.
AID00142889	Mom died waiting for him, and she had me to raise. She was sick but she held off dying until I was old enough to be getting into trouble with boys.
AID00142890	As for Dad, I figure he just got himself lost or dead. Happens... and I'm not all boo-hoo about it, so save your glass for someone who's crying.
AID00142891	Your mother was a tribal?
AID00142892	You know, like one of the tribes from the East - we got 'em out West, too. NCR's herding 'em up, though, domesticating them.
AID00142893	Mom was from East of the Colorado, though, not sure what tribe. Was before the time Caesar rounded them up, made them Legion.
AID00142894	She walked a hell of a way until she crossed paths with my Dad and he convinced her to stop walking. And lucky for me, he was a horny old bastard.
AID00142895	Any other weapons you know how to use?
AID00142896	What, you mean like spears? No, none of that. Mom was a tribal, but she didn't teach me anything like that.
AID00142897	Never mind. Let's move on.
AID00142898	Sounds good to me.
AID00142899	I had some other questions.
AID00142900	And where did you learn how to handle dynamite?
AID00142901	You've used explosives?
AID00142902	Dynamite's for when you don't have enough bullets, want to clear a pass, or scare off Geckos from a caravan.
AID00142903	Some of the twisters out of the Divide can block off a pass in no time, so you learn how to handle powder so you don't get trapped somewhere.
AID00142904	Any event, I prefer shooting if it comes down to an argument. Don't worry, I'll carry my weight if a disagreement arises.
AID00142905	Where did you learn to shoot?
AID00142906	Short of caps is what taught me, mostly. Ammo's expensive... so I learned to make every shot count.
AID00142907	And hear tell, my Dad was a crack shot, so I don't want to dirty the family name. Not out of pride - respect.
AID00142908	You any good in a fight?
AID00142909	I'm fair with chucking dynamite and not bad with a pistol, if I do say so myself. Carry a knife, too, but that's more for practical reasons.
AID00142910	Prefer settling things with my fists, though. Made more friends than corpses in bar fights - plan on keeping it that way.
AID00142911	Don't think I'm some kind of Vault City pacifist, though - if things get heated, I'll start shooting, trust me.
AID00142912	VEndingNCRCF
AID00142913	After Hoover Dam, the leaderless Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility vanished into the wastes, leaving the prison empty.
AID00142914	The Correctional Facility became another abandoned ruin in the wasteland, its carcass occasionally picked over by enterprising prospectors.
AID00142915	With the Dam firmly in their grasp, the NCR turned its attention towards wresting the Correctional Facility from Powder Ganger hands.
AID00142916	The Powder Gangers are no match for the battle-hardened troops of the NCR, and summary execution awaited the Powder Gangers who managed to survive.
AID00142917	Most Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility fled into the wasteland rather than face the advancing forces of the Legion.
AID00142918	Those brave or foolish to remain were killed or crucified by the merciless Legionaries.
AID00142919	The NCR, battered by the loss of the Dam, were unable to devote any troops to retaking the Correctional Facility from the Powder Gangers.
AID00142920	As a result, Powder Ganger raids on caravans became an unfortunate fact of life in the Mojave for years to come.
AID00142921	VMS25WalterPheebusTopicEthelDead
AID00142922	Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
AID00142923	Anyone stupid enough not to set a watch deserved what they got.
AID00142924	Maybe we made a mistake. It was early on, we didn't know just how serious it was out there.
AID00142925	But to say they deserved it? What kind of devil are you, boss?
AID00142926	You can't think it was your fault. No one could stand against a dozen armed men all alone.
AID00142927	I know that, boss. That's not what I'm getting at. I'm just getting sentimental in my old age. Anyways, forget it. Just wanted that off my chest.
AID00142928	And you blame yourself for this?
AID00142929	Maybe. I don't know. All I know is that for all my skill with a pistol, I couldn't help them.
AID00142930	Anyway, that was weighing on my mind. Thanks for letting me get it out in the open, boss.
AID00142931	What happened then?
AID00142932	Rafaela and I ran. We were pursued by some of the men who attacked our home, but I was always a good shot.
AID00142933	The ones who came after us, I killed. The rest, I left be. I had to take care of Rafaela, not throw my life away on revenge.
AID00142934	What happened then?
AID00142935	About two dozen men came back in the night, after we'd gone to sleep. They set fire to the ranch house and barred the doors from the outside.
AID00142936	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out though a window, but everyone else....
AID00142937	My parents, my grandmother, my two brothers and two of my sisters all died.
AID00142938	Go on.
AID00142939	Just a few days after Mexico City was vaporized, refugees started pouring down the road to our ranch. We helped who we could, but there were so many.
AID00142940	Eventually, my father started turning people away before we ran out of food. Things got violent. My father and I got our guns, and we drove them off.
AID00142941	I don't really have time for this, Raul. Maybe later?
AID00142942	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you.
AID00142943	Are you talking about something from your own past?
AID00142944	A memory from a long time ago.
AID00142945	I suppose if you're happy with that kind of life, it's not so bad.
AID00142946	Maybe... but what if you miss the old days, sometimes?
AID00142947	Is that something you're afraid of?
AID00142948	That fear has always been a part of my life.
AID00142949	At least he knew when to step back and start to take it easy. A lot of people don't.
AID00142950	Yeah, it beats dying alone in the Wasteland because you were too slow.
AID00142951	What's on your mind?
AID00142952	Old history, boss.
AID00142953	Loyal's using his years of knowledge to help his tribe. I think that's a noble goal.
AID00142954	Yeah. That's what I thought, too.
AID00142955	Don't waste my time with your reminiscing, Raul.
AID00142956	Whatever you say, boss. I'll just stay back here and be quiet in case you have a sudden flash of brilliance you need to share.
AID00142957	Already cleared the roads for Jackson.
AID00142958	No shit? Drink's on me, then.
AID00142959	Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
AID00142960	That drinking's going to get you in trouble in a second.
AID00142961	Trouble's already come and went, so anything you bring will make my next drink go down easier.
AID00142962	I'd slow down on that whiskey, if I were you.
AID00142963	Yeah, well, you aren't me, so good-for-fucking-you.
AID00142964	So you're out of the caravan business?
AID00142965	Sure am. Burned for the last time, and this time, it's for good. Worse, it's not done kicking me - I'm still trapped here.
AID00142966	What are you going to do?
AID00142967	Drink. Got a lot of memories to drown. If I die while doing it, so be it. Got nowhere else to go.
AID00142968	Who's Jackson?
AID00142969	NCR officer, trooper, whatever - runs the place. He's over in the main building, the one without a bar.
AID00142970	Jackson won't let me head north, it's not safe... and even though my caravan's gone, my caravan papers are keeping me here.
AID00142971	So if you came here for work, my advice? Go find the Crimson Caravan branch, south of Vegas. They can help you out.
AID00142972	Might have been Fiends, they're crazy like that.
AID00142973	Doesn't sound like raiders.
AID00142974	Why would they do that?
AID00142975	My guess is Legion, they're trying to cut NCR's supply line... and the Mojave Outpost is proof. Got us locked up tighter than a New Vegas virgin.
AID00142976	No caravans in, out, and just try arguing with Jackson about it. "Roads aren't safe," he says.
AID00142977	No shit, you washed-out old fuckup, I didn't need a Brotherhood Scribe to tell me that.
AID00142978	Uh, how about you keep your hands by your sides.
AID00142979	Don't worry, not looking to throw punches just yet. And something tells me hitting you would be a mistake I wouldn't want to repeat.
AID00142980	Back West?
AID00142981	Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I'm not from around here and I'm not NCR. I run a caravan... or did.
AID00142982	What are you trying to forget?
AID00142983	Lost my caravan heading north, the driver burned to ash - and they didn't even take the cargo, they just burned that, too.
AID00142984	Think we got off on the wrong foot. How about a drink?
AID00142985	Are you all right?
AID00142986	All right? No, I'm not all right.
AID00142987	Drinking to forget, and it's only getting me mad instead. Whiskey always gets my temper up - now more than ever.
AID00142988	Drinking used to cause all sorts of trouble back West - before I punched enough people, that is, and they learned to lay low when the whiskey hit.
AID00142989	Pendant?
AID00142990	Tell me about the pendant.
AID00142991	Whiskey Rose?
AID00142992	Yeah, on account of my name... and the blossoms on my cheeks when I drink too much.
AID00142993	Won most of those fights, too. Can take a hell of a punch and give it right back when I've got a bottle in me.
AID00142994	It's all in how you drink it, though - there's a trick to it. When we pass the bottle, I'll show you how it's done.
AID00142995	Is whiskey your drink of choice?
AID00142996	Not sure if I chose it or it chose me. Dad ran a bar a long time ago, and it was a labor of love, Mom said. Didn't sound like it made her happy.
AID00142997	Still, I'm guessing I got some of Dad's love of whiskey in me, because the burn suits me fine.
AID00142998	Used to call me "Whiskey Rose" back West, before I punched enough people, so now they say it, but quiet and when I'm not around.
AID00142999	All right. Come on, let's go.
AID00143000	Thank god, the sooner the better.
AID00143001	What's wrong?
AID00143002	Aside from the TV-faced robots, the dust, and the old man smell in every room? Nothing, it's a paradise.
AID00143003	This place has the Old World Blues about it. Everything in here feels like it should have passed on a long time ago.
AID00143004	Hell, it's hard to believe Vegas is right outside. So, yeah, I'm looking to leave whenever you're ready.
AID00143005	Stay here, you know exactly what's going to happen, day in, day out.
AID00143006	So fighting boredom is your argument, huh?
AID00143007	Do you really want to stay in this shithole?
AID00143008	Hnh. The Outpost lost its charm about three bottles ago, and that was just this morning.
AID00143009	If your world's a whiskey bottle, there's more out there.
AID00143010	Oh, that's got just the right bite of judgment to it, stings a little, too. Did you hear that from a Followers preacher?
AID00143011	I bet you could preach all day, who knows what other little bits of wisdom might spill out.
AID00143012	Why not? I could use someone who knows the roads.
AID00143013	So you're looking for someone to help, not just tag along? Hnh.
AID00143014	Maybe it's not where you go, it's the company.
AID00143015	"It's the company?" That has got to be the biggest load of Brahmin shit I've ever heard.
AID00143016	Still, if you got more like that...
AID00143017	There's other places to go.
AID00143018	Where? Like Vegas? Chewed and spit enough friends out. East? Get put in one of Caesar's little "camps?" No thanks.
AID00143019	Head back West? I already know the Big Circle and everyone in it - 'cept now I go back there, ruined.
AID00143020	Never really realized how small the Mojave's getting nowadays, hard to find a place to go to that's worthwhile.
AID00143021	That's... one way to put it.
AID00143022	Didn't ask Mom to elaborate. Never heard her complain about his bedroom behavior, only complain he wasn't around to do it no more.
AID00143023	I've met him. Nice impersonation.
AID00143024	Yeah, he's been with NCR so long all he can see is the worst outcome of everything - so he doesn't do anything.
AID00143025	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
AID00143026	You're looking at it. It's a watering hole without much to brag about.
AID00143027	It's like a Brahmin drive gone wrong - supposed to be a gate north, but you come here, you get caught in the pen. Better to head back home.
AID00143028	If you don't have a gun and a will, don't matter much what you do when you reach here, except stare at that fucking monument outside.
AID00143029	That fucking monument outside?
AID00143030	Don't even tell me you missed it coming in. It's like NCR showing its dick to all the East.
AID00143031	If the Republic put as much effort into protecting the East as they put into those two asinine giants outside, then they'd be worth that monument.
AID00143032	Statues of two men shaking hands covered in blood don't seem to be nothing to brag about.
AID00143033	Covered in blood?
AID00143034	I'm speaking figurative, isn't any blood on their damn hands. Course, when Caesar comes walking through here, there'll be blood for real.
AID00143035	And after the blood dries in the sun, he'll melt that piece of Jet-induced sculpture down, and reshape it into a bull.
AID00143036	Which by my reckoning is making up for a deficiency of his. But no matter what the state of his pecker, he's sure giving the West a good fucking.
AID00143037	What are those statues supposed to be?
AID00143038	One's a ranger, one's an NCR trooper, supposed to represent unification of West and East... or some such shit.
AID00143039	As far as those two iron lovebirds go, they've got more spine than you'll see in a year from the NCR government.
AID00143040	What did you mean about "covered in blood" before?
AID00143041	Why are you here at the bar?
AID00143042	Whiskey and me are old friends, keeps me going when times get rough. Like now.
AID00143043	Got me into the caravan business, you know - had to start transporting water instead of liquor, though.
AID00143044	If I hadn't switched over, I'd end my trip with nothing but glass bottles rattling on the back of the Brahmin.
AID00143045	Any work around here?
AID00143046	If you're looking to sign on with a caravan, no - traders are bottled up tight here.
AID00143047	Caravan work's up north, check with the Crimson Caravan, maybe. Gun Runners might have work, wouldn't know for sure, though.
AID00143048	Still, if you got a gun, guts, and feeling like going on patrol, might be some of the soldiers around here have work for you.
AID00143049	[NCR] I think they're both rangers, one desert, one NCR.
AID00143050	Hnh. Maybe you're right. Brimmed hats always throw me off.
AID00143051	Well, fine, whatever, they can be shaking each other's dicks, wouldn't change the Mojave now.
AID00143052	Running and gunning sounds interesting.
AID00143053	Jackson might have something for you, if you haven't already spoken to that old buzzard.
AID00143054	He was looking to try and get troops to clear the north road. You can find him over in the other building - the one without a bar.
AID00143055	Any other work?
AID00143056	I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
AID00143057	Sniper on the roof?
AID00143058	Yeah, her name's... Ghost or something... fucking scary, ooooooh. Guess it's cause you'll never see her 'til your dead.
AID00143059	NCR and their goddamn nicknames, as if Caesar himself's gonna piss and run if he hears them.
AID00143060	Anyway, go on and head up top, ask her what's going on, if you haven't already. I don't much give a shit.
AID00143061	Any other work?
AID00143062	Um, I should probably go.
AID00143063	I'll just wait here for Mistress Tabitha.
AID00143064	I hate to tell you, but Tabitha's dead.
AID00143065	And I suppose you're taking credit for the deed, fiend! I will avenge her!
AID00143066	BMTabithaYesRhonda
AID00143067	Yes, Rhonda.
AID00143068	BMRhondaLetsGoTabitha
AID00143069	Mistress Tabitha, we should be heading off. Our journey has been much delayed, but we can catch up if we hurry.  Come along, now.
AID00143070	You're welcome.
AID00143071	It's just... such a shock to see Rhonda up and about again. I'm not sure what to do now.
AID00143072	BMRhondaGreetsTabitha
AID00143073	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is he a friend of yours?
AID00143074	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is she a friend of yours?
AID00143075	BMTabithaCornersPlayer
AID00143076	R-Rhonda? Is that you?
AID00143077	Does this mean you're not going to kill me?
AID00143078	No, of course not. I... don't know what I'm going to do now with Rhonda back...
AID00143079	Well, in the meantime, he's given me a suite at the Lucky 38.
AID00143080	Does it come with its own Deathclaw? Trust me, if you can't see it, something just as nasty's waiting.
AID00143081	Whole Lucky 38... the idea that there's this casino in the middle of a town of people, and only you're ever let inside?
AID00143082	Feels like other places I've been. Something that isolated from everyday folks starts to take on a bad shine.
AID00143083	Didn't introduce himself, wore a bad suit.
AID00143084	Bad suit, huh? Well, if assholes had taste, we'd all be feasting on shit.
AID00143085	Still... suit means money, and suits stand out, especially here in the Mojave. One of the larger towns, or Vegas, might be the place to go.
AID00143086	Don't you worry, though, we'll sort this asshole out, rattle his cage a little.
AID00143087	Benny, wore a checkered suit.
AID00143088	Can't say I've heard the name. Or heard about any man dressed like a seat cover.
AID00143089	I don't think it was personal.
AID00143090	Well if it wasn't before, it is now.
AID00143091	Did he bother to introduce himself, or did he not take you for somebody who'd get up again when killed?
AID00143092	He wanted something I was carrying.
AID00143093	So he robbed you? Robbing a courier's low, and any family or group he's with is going to get a black eye for it.
AID00143094	Caravan code of the wastes is you don't fuck with the one who brings you your mail, and you don't fuck with your supply line.
AID00143095	Hope this shithead knows what he's in for. From both of us... what's his name?
AID00143096	A doctor helped patch me up.
AID00143097	Two shots in the head without an Auto-Doc is a lot of patching. Hope you thanked him properly.
AID00143098	Who's this snake that put bullets in your head? Did he have cause, or...?
AID00143099	Twice. In the head.
AID00143100	And you got better.
AID00143101	Don't really want to talk about it.
AID00143102	Fine, then, not trying to pry. Just wondering what would make a Courier run around the desert without a contract is all. Forget I asked.
AID00143103	Looking for a man who shot me.
AID00143104	A man who shot you.
AID00143105	Not exciting enough for you?
AID00143106	It ain't so bad. If Caesar's Legion decides to push West through Nipton ol' Mojave Outpost here will be the front line.
AID00143107	Who are you?
AID00143108	Me, I'm Knight - Major Knight. I've been stuck here dealing with these caravans for ages now, but somebody's gotta do it.
AID00143109	Can you tell me about the Outpost?
AID00143110	NCR border guard duty mostly. It's our job to make sure the caravans can move safely along I-15 and Highway 95.
AID00143111	Not the best posting or assignment, but it beats being sent East, or patrolling the Colorado. Legion's pretty thick there.
AID00143112	I changed my mind. This is something we should confront together.
AID00143113	No. This is something for me to deal with. But I'm glad you're here.
AID00143114	I've heard enough. Let's move on.
AID00143115	All right, then.
AID00143116	I wanted to ask you some questions.
AID00143117	I had other questions.
AID00143118	I wanted to ask you something else.
AID00143119	I guess this is goodbye, then.
AID00143120	Can we talk about this?
AID00143121	Fuck that. You can walk the road to hell on your own.
AID00143122	Come on, I can change, really.
AID00143123	Look, the Mojave's a tough place, all right?
AID00143124	You need to be tougher. If you let the Mojave get you down, then you've given up on life.
AID00143125	So straighten out, stop being so shifty and... downright mean, and see if that doesn't change your outlook.
AID00143126	I'm trying to do better... really trying.
AID00143127	[SUCCEEDED] All right... maybe I was a little harsh. I can be that way.
AID00143128	I've made mistakes. You judging me doesn't help.
AID00143129	[FAILED] Trying's the same thing as giving up, the way you're saying it.
AID00143130	<Lie> I heard you, I did. I've changed... inside.
AID00143131	[SUCCEEDED] I'll hold you to that promise, then. I'm not known for my patience, though.
AID00143132	<Lie> I'll change Cass, I promise.
AID00143133	[FAILED] Inside? Yeah, must be deep inside, all right.
AID00143134	I'm... not proud of what I've done. I'm trying to change, really.
AID00143135	[SUCCEEDED] Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
AID00143136	Tough words, but I needed to hear them. I'll change, I promise.
AID00143137	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
AID00143138	<Lie> Look... I'm trying to change, life's tough.
AID00143139	[SUCCEEDED] Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
AID00143140	<Lie> The Mojave's a hard place. But I need to rise above that.
AID00143141	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
AID00143142	<Attack>That's it. Tired of listening to you anyway.
AID00143143	You're seriously going to draw on me? Fine, do it, see what happens.
AID00143144	Life means we have to make tough choices - me included.
AID00143145	Who you are comes from the choices you make when life gets tough.
AID00143146	So if you're saying that life is dragging you down, I don't buy it. You better start changing your attitude, or I'm heading back West, you hear?
AID00143147	Good, go back to your famil... oh wait, they're fucking dead.
AID00143148	You son of a bitch. You know, I was just going to give you a piece of my mind and now? Now I'm going to put you down.
AID00143149	Go back West, then, see if I care.
AID00143150	Fine, I will, jackass.
AID00143151	You can have your shit back, I don't need it or want it. You go your way, I'm going mine.
AID00143152	And don't try looking for me - it was a mistake to show up in the Mojave in the first place, and I'm not about to repeat that mistake twice.
AID00143153	<Barter Options>
AID00143154	[SUCCEEDED] I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
AID00143155	Having Primm - and the trade route - under NCR control would help the West.
AID00143156	[FAILED] NCR is not in the habit of buying and selling towns... unless that was some sort of joke on your part.
AID00143157	If the NCR runs Primm... I bet you could sell it to... someone... somewhere.
AID00143158	One of the convicts from NCRCF is looking for a pardon so he can protect Primm.
AID00143159	One of the Powder Gangers? They've been nothing but trouble for us - why would we want one of them anywhere in an official capacity?
AID00143160	Hayes is undermanned and is requesting some additional support.
AID00143161	I'd like to help - but we can't spare any more units. We have to maintain a minimum headcount at the Outpost, orders from the West.
AID00143162	I'd like to talk to you about Primm.
AID00143163	Primm? Hayes' unit is stationed up there, were having problems with some of the NCRCF convicts. What can I help you with?
AID00143164	Do you know where I can find the courier office?
AID00143165	Sure do. I run the courier office out of my shop. Leastaways I did before things went to hell around here.
AID00143166	What do you need to take over protecting the town?
AID00143167	What we need, more than anything, is bodies.
AID00143168	If we had just one more squad, we could easily install a sheriff and still handle our primary objective of protecting the interstate south of here.
AID00143169	If you'd like to see the NCR include protection of Primm in its duties, then you'll have to get some more troops up here.
AID00143170	Knight, at Mojave outpost, may be able to help.
AID00143171	That's it for now.
AID00143172	Goodbye.
AID00143173	I have some other questions.
AID00143174	I have some free time, ask away.
AID00143175	Never mind.
AID00143176	Yeah, forget about it.
AID00143177	< Speech 20 >
AID00143178	[SUCCEEDED] Robbed some people, burned some things, killed a few guys.
AID00143179	I just need to know if I should watch my step around you.
AID00143180	[FAILED] Like I said, mind your own damn business.
AID00143181	I was just curious.
AID00143182	What were you in prison for?
AID00143183	None of your damn business. You ought to know better than to ask a man that kind of question.
AID00143184	This area is your territory?
AID00143185	It is now. Me and the rest of the guys busted out of the NCR prison east of here and took over. Now we're calling the shots.
AID00143186	You were a prospector - like digging for gold and silver?
AID00143187	Nah, nah - means I poked through old buildings looking for working tech and such. Some folks just call it "salvaging," but never liked the term.
AID00143188	Way I see it, salvage means it's broken, near-worthless. Me, I looked for the good stuff - guns, chems, spare parts. Good money in it.
AID00143189	Never mind.
AID00143190	Yup.
AID00143191	Goodbye.
AID00143192	Vale.
AID00143193	So what did you do?
AID00143194	I left Mexico City behind. I made my way out to the Gulf Coast, eventually I found an old Petro-Chico refinery nobody had claimed.
AID00143195	I stayed there for a little while, and I thought a lot about my life. I thought about the guns I'd lived by and what they'd gotten me.
AID00143196	I decided my guns hadn't gotten me anything, and it was time to give it up. I took off that old vaquero outfit, and put on a Petro-Chico jumpsuit.
AID00143197	The name tag said "Miguel," so I started using the name myself. Eventually I made it to Arizona... but that's another story, boss.
AID00143198	That's terrible, Raul.
AID00143199	Terrible doesn't begin to cover it, boss. I'd let my whole family down - first the ranch, now Rafaela. I was the last Tejada.
AID00143200	I guess maybe I went a little crazy then. I took my guns, and I went back to that market. I didn't have many bullets, but I had enough.
AID00143201	After the raiders were dead, I salvaged what I could from the store. I was tired... I just wanted to be alone forever.
AID00143202	Go on. What happened to Rafaela?
AID00143203	She went out to find some food one day. I was sick, so I stayed at our camp. I guess it must have been the beginnings of radiation poisoning.
AID00143204	Anyway, it was supposed to be safe, but some raiders happened to pass through where she was scavenging. I won't speak of what they did to her.
AID00143205	When I found her body, the only way to recognize her was this funny little scar on her knee from when she was a little girl.
AID00143206	Wasn't it dangerous to be dressed so... noticably?
AID00143207	It was. I started to build up a legend. Sometimes it headed off trouble, but most of the time it just started more.
AID00143208	Young punks looking to prove themselves would come looking for me, but my eyes were sharp and my guns were quick.
AID00143209	For a whle it seemed like we might even survive there, until... until Rafaela.
AID00143210	Sounds pretty bad.
AID00143211	You're a poet of understatement, boss. But there were moments it was almost worth it. I still remember finding that novelty costume shop.
AID00143212	I was just looking for something I could slice up to wrap my burns when I saw the vaquero outfit hanging on the rack, like it hadn't been touched.
AID00143213	I took it - not like anybody else needed it, you know? - and wore it back to our camp. Rafaela laughed for the first time since the bombs had fallen.
AID00143214	We'll talk later.
AID00143215	Really? Thanks for the reminder, boss, I'd almost forgotten.
AID00143216	You're wrong. You can still fight, and you should take up your guns again.
AID00143217	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
AID00143218	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
AID00143219	You're wrong. You should give up the gun and focus on repairing things.
AID00143220	You're right. You should give up the guns for good and focus on fixing things.
AID00143221	I think you're right. You should focus on gunslinging. You'll do the memories of your family proud.
AID00143222	About your decision....
AID00143223	Yeah, boss?
AID00143224	That's not true, Raul, you're great with a pistol.
AID00143225	[SUCCEEDED] You think so? Well... you're the boss. Okay, I'll give it a try.
AID00143226	But if I get killed, and if there's an afterlife, I'll haunt your ass.
AID00143227	I don't think that's a good idea. You should focus on your mechanical skills instead.
AID00143228	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you're right, boss. These bones are too old for that kind of action.
AID00143229	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
AID00143230	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
AID00143231	If that's what you think is best, I won't stop you.
AID00143232	Thanks, boss. I'd hate to think I was disappointing you with my life-altering decision.
AID00143233	I think that's a great idea, Raul, and I hope you'll put them to good use with me.
AID00143234	You can bet on that, boss.
AID00143235	Doubts? About what?
AID00143236	About whether I still had what it took to carry my pistols proudly, to use them to do what's right.
AID00143237	And now that I've been traveling with you for a while, you've made me realize that I can still do that.
AID00143238	Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be, but my brains can make up for that, and my hands are still quick enough. It's time to put the guns back on.
AID00143239	About whether I'm really too old to keep living the life of a gunslinger after all. And after seeing what you go through, boss, I think I am.
AID00143240	From now on, I'll let you deal with the fighting and stick to keeping your gear working. I don't want to slow you down more than I already do.
AID00143241	What happened then?
AID00143242	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AID00143243	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AID00143244	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize I've always had my doubts.
AID00143245	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AID00143246	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AID00143247	After seeing what you go through, I think I made the right choice. So thanks for that, boss.
AID00143248	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AID00143249	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AID00143250	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize that was the wrong decision. So thanks for that, boss.
AID00143251	How did you survive?
AID00143252	By being a meaner old cuss than the rest of them, boss. I wanted to keep living until they weren't, so I just kept shooting until they were all dead.
AID00143253	I was in pretty bad shape in the end, though. I don't know how long I laid there with the sun baking me and the buzzards chomping at me.
AID00143254	Eventually I got the strength to start moving. Some long time after that, I managed to drag my carcass back to town.
AID00143255	Did you rescue her?
AID00143256	I went after Dave and his brothers. They had a head start, but they slept nights. I didn't. Took me three days to catch up to them.
AID00143257	Claudia was dead when I got there. They'd put a bullet in each of her eyes. I couldn't do anything except avenge her, just like Rafaela.
AID00143258	I charged into the middle of their camp and started firing - two of them were dead before they knew I was there. The other five, though....
AID00143259	They shot the shit out of me. I would have died, I think, if I wasn't so full of rage.
AID00143260	But they didn't, did they?
AID00143261	No, boss. No they didn't.
AID00143262	As I was saying, I hoped they'd leave the town in peace. Instead, they decided to stop at Claudia's brothel to take the edge off.
AID00143263	I don't know which one of them got rowdy first, but by the time I heard the screams and got my guns, it was too late.
AID00143264	They'd shot up the brothel, killed four girls, and taken Claudia for their sport.
AID00143265	What happened with her?
AID00143266	This was a long time ago. Before Caesar's Legion pacified Arizona and brought the raider tribes to heel.
AID00143267	A tribe came into Tuscon one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
AID00143268	I figured if I did that, they'd leave town before they tore it up too much.
AID00143269	Why aren't you still there, then?
AID00143270	Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tuscon - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tuscon, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
AID00143271	Prettiest thing you ever saw, boss. Maybe it was just a trick of my senile brain, but I swear she looked just like my Rafaela. Her name was Claudia.
AID00143272	She ended up taking work at one of the brothels in town. I never went to her, of course - how could I? But I looked after her in my own way.
AID00143273	Fixing things?
AID00143274	Oh, sure, boss. I was always good at fixing things. Some I fixed for the town, some I fixed for other people, some I fixed just for the hell of it.
AID00143275	It's a better way to use your hands than killing, and even then I wasn't getting any younger or faster.
AID00143276	I lived there for a long time. Kept to myself, didn't get into any fights - hell, the only reason I even kept my guns oiled was professional pride.
AID00143277	Wasn't Mexico City basically annihilated in the Great War?
AID00143278	I don't think it was as hard hit as DC or Bakersfield, but it was bad enough. By the time we got there, the city was a radioactive ruin.
AID00143279	Still, the city was full of looters, already forming into the beginnings of raider tribes. Crime was bad before the War, but now it was a nightmare.
AID00143280	We were living like scavengers, scraping by on what little food we could find, always looking for medicine for my burns.
AID00143281	And then, of course, the radiation started to kick in, turning me into this handsome devil you see before you.
AID00143282	VMS49HardinDiscussion1
AID00143283	What is it, Veronica?
AID00143284	Hardin. Er, Elder. I know why we're failing.
AID00143285	Do you?
AID00143286	As long as we hide in here, ignoring the outside, our days are numbered.
AID00143287	For once, I agree.
AID00143288	You do?
AID00143289	We can't let people go on believing the Brotherhood has lost its teeth.
AID00143290	We must strike while our enemies are distracted with each other.
AID00143291	Strike? That's how we got into this problem in the first place. We can't beat these armies.
AID00143292	Our entire two hundred years of history say that a handful of troops with the best equipment and training can stand up to any army.
AID00143293	And the loss of HELIOS One says things are different now.
AID00143294	That was a failure of strategy, not philosophy. If Father El- the Elder in charge were a Paladin and not a Scribe-
AID00143295	Our arrogance would still have been our downfall.
AID00143296	History says otherwise.
AID00143297	Maybe it's time you start looking forward.
AID00143298	Let's go. We're wasting our time.
AID00143299	Let's talk about something else.
AID00143300	I don't care about your radio. Where did those guys go?
AID00143301	< Sneak 25 >
AID00143302	[SUCCEEDED] That does sound like a good plan. All right, you seem to know what you're doing, so you can count me in.
AID00143303	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
AID00143304	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
AID00143305	Near the saloon and store are good spots to stage an ambush - if I had the help.
AID00143306	[FAILED] No thank you. Good luck with your, uh, "ambush."
AID00143307	I could probably take out the powder gang by surprise, if I had help. Probably.
AID00143308	< Speech 25 >
AID00143309	[SUCCEEDED] I was planning on sitting this one out, but for some reason I can't help but like you. I'm with you.
AID00143310	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
AID00143311	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
AID00143312	You should help me take down the powder gang. Bullets, explosions, lots of fun.
AID00143313	[FAILED] All the more reason for me to sit this one out. I'll be rooting for you, though.
AID00143314	Uh, we're a little outnumbered against the powder gang. Think you could help?
AID00143315	< Barter 20 >
AID00143316	[SUCCEEDED] Not at all! I'm never sure how much is normally charged for this sort of thing. Here's some additional caps - that should be enough.
AID00143317	Now, how about spending some of those caps in the saloon?
AID00143318	That's it? Are you implying that I've done shoddy work?
AID00143319	[FAILED] I could get another working radio with the caps I already gave you. Now, how about spending some of those caps right now?
AID00143320	That's all? I think you could afford to pay me a little more.
AID00143321	So I help Ringo, and Goodsprings will like me more. What if I help the Powder Gangers?
AID00143322	Don't know why you'd want to go do a thing like that. Yeah, you'd get on their good side, but people around here wouldn't appreciate it one bit.
AID00143323	What happens if I help Ringo?
AID00143324	If you were able to get Ringo out of this mess, you'd have a decent reputation around Goodsprings. I'd even set you up with a discount.
AID00143325	Of course, helping Ringo would also make the Powder Gangers mad, and they've got a lot of friends out there.
AID00143326	Jack is interested in a girl.
AID00143327	Well well, this is welcome news. Who is she?
AID00143328	She works for the Crimson Caravan.
AID00143329	She's with those traders? They've tried to contact us before, but I'm not interested in trading with greedy savages.
AID00143330	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
AID00143331	Just some kookie dame looking for love.
AID00143332	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
AID00143333	<Speech>
AID00143334	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm, I suppose Jack deserves a chance at love. You can tell Jack she has a free pass to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
AID00143335	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
AID00143336	It would mean a lot to Jack if she could come to Nellis.
AID00143337	[FAILED] Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
AID00143338	She's a great gal, you'll love her.
AID00143339	<Ladykiller>
AID00143340	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I'd be wrong to deny Jack such joy in his life.
AID00143341	He's done right by the tribe many times over. Tell Jack this girl is free to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
AID00143342	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
AID00143343	Come on, Pearl, think of the joy it would bring Jack. He's in love.
AID00143344	<Reputation>
AID00143345	Very well, I'll take your word when you say she isn't a threat to the tribe. I will allow her entry if Jack will take responsibility for her.
AID00143346	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
AID00143347	I assure you, Janet would not be a threat to the tribe.
AID00143348	Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
AID00143349	She couldn't hurt a fly. Let her into Nellis.
AID00143350	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00143351	Very well.
AID00143352	I'd like to talk about allowing Janet to visit Jack.
AID00143353	I'd rather not allow more outsiders in, but I'll hear you out.
AID00143354	I'm still working on it.
AID00143355	Okay, well let me know what she says.
AID00143356	I convinced her to pay you what you're owed. You're free to leave.
AID00143357	That's great! I can't believe you went through all this trouble for me. Thank you!
AID00143358	You're free to leave, but McLafferty won't pay you. That's the deal.
AID00143359	I see. Well, thank you for trying. I'm off to go see my admirer now.
AID00143360	I won't do it.
AID00143361	I'll begin looking immediately.
AID00143362	I'm glad I can count on you. Oh, and one other thing. The patrols each had a holotape detailing their missions that you can use to track them.
AID00143363	The shielding of the bunker prevents us from actively tracking them, but their positions should show up on your map once you get to the surface.
AID00143364	Should our worst fears become realized, please bring back all three of the holotapes from the patrols. Otherwise, bring our brothers home.
AID00143365	I've given the order that you be given access to some of the equipment our scouts and patrols have scavenged over the years.
AID00143366	You won't be allowed to purchase any prohibited equipment, but hopefully some of what's available will prove useful to you.
AID00143367	What are the rules of Caravan?
AID00143368	It's a two-player game, and the winner takes the whole pot. You build a "caravan" using the cards in your deck.
AID00143369	The goal is to create caravan bids that beat your opponent's bids, so there's more strategy than luck involved.
AID00143370	It's why you won't see Caravan in any casino - too slow-paced, and more importantly, no house edge.
AID00143371	Here, take this holotape - it goes into more specifics about the rules. You'll also need a deck, so take one of my spares.
AID00143372	So... you feel like playing a game?
AID00143373	[PRESS DEMO] I'll look for your men and supplies. Send me to HELIOS One.
AID00143374	Thanks. Watch your back out there. Never know when those Legion bastards might show up.
AID00143375	HELLO
AID00143376	PLAYERLEAVESIRONSIGHTS
AID00143377	
AID00143378	PLAYERENTERSIRONSIGHTS
AID00143379	
AID00143380	Not yet, but let me ask you about something else first.
AID00143381	Alright, ask away.
AID00143382	I'll let you know when I do.
AID00143383	Okay, hurry back. I don't want anyone to start shooting at me.
AID00143384	Where should I go to get you a pardon?
AID00143385	There is a NCR camp down on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think, try to find someone of authority there.
AID00143386	Primm has seen better days.
AID00143387	It has. It was a promising trade town - before the escape at the correctional facility. Lost a good bit of money at the Vikki and Vance.
AID00143388	Goodbye.
AID00143389	Goodbye.
AID00143390	Never mind, I'll be leaving now.
AID00143391	Goodbye.
AID00143392	<Bribe>
AID00143393	Well, having a sheriff who was a convict is better than no sheriff at all... and if he has the qualifications... all right, hand it over.
AID00143394	Do you think I could "buy" a pardon for 200 caps?
AID00143395	If you had 200 caps, we could talk business - until then, we don't have anything to talk about.
AID00143396	Do you think I could "buy" a pardon for 200 caps?
AID00143397	<Speech Options>
AID00143398	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. All right. If his sentence was closing up I can see about getting him pardoned.
AID00143399	Primm is important to our trade up from California, so having someone there who owes us a favor... that couldn't hurt.
AID00143400	His sentence was almost up, and he isn't tied to the Powder Gangers.
AID00143401	[FAILED] I don't think so. I'm not going to put my word on the line for some random convict.
AID00143402	Come on, he's just a convict. How bad could he be?
AID00143403	I'd like to know more about Mr. House.
AID00143404	I'm afraid I don't know much myself. Mr. House has got his own casino, the Lucky 38, but nobody goes in or out except his robots.
AID00143405	The other casinos follow Mr. House's rules, so I guess that makes him the leader of New Vegas. As far as I know, nobody's ever laid eyes on the guy.
AID00143406	I think that robot who pulled you out of the dirt belongs to Mr. House. If Mr. House is looking after you, that's gotta be a good thing, right?
AID00143407	Why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
AID00143408	You're the mechanic around here?
AID00143409	Actually, hang out here for a while.
AID00143410	Oh, sure thing. I haven't even remotely grown sick of staring at this place.
AID00143411	Very funny.
AID00143412	Talk to me at my shack, I've at least got tools there.
AID00143413	Then why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
AID00143414	Probably because it used to be Miguel's. Whoever he was. How about if you let me go, huh boss?
AID00143415	Really?
AID00143416	<Sigh.> No. No, boss, I'm, a prisoner of the crazy Super Mutant with the wig and the glasses. I was kind of hoping you were here to set me free.
AID00143417	But maybe I'm not a pretty enough damsel for that, huh?
AID00143418	Who are you?
AID00143419	Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
AID00143420	You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
AID00143421	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada. Can I leave now, or did you want to ask me again in five minutes?
AID00143422	What do you mean, took me long enough?
AID00143423	Sorry. I assumed the only reason you'd fight past a horde of Super mutants and pick the lock on my cell is if you heard my cry for help on the radio.
AID00143424	But maybe you're just sightseeing. So, since the door's open and all, can I go now?
AID00143425	VCG02QuestTransition
AID00143426	One more thing I wanted to show you.
AID00143427	Thought I might teach you about living off the land, and making useful things for yourself. Interested?
AID00143428	[END TUTORIAL] No need. I think I've got it covered from here.
AID00143429	Okay, say no more.
AID00143430	Couldn't hurt.
AID00143431	All right, then. We'll need a couple ingredients to get started. Gonna want some Xander Root and a Broc Flower.
AID00143432	Lemme think now... I know I've seen Broc Flowers growing up at the graveyard. And I seem to remember there being Xander Root over by the schoolhouse.
AID00143433	Bring those on back to me, and we'll get cooking.
AID00143434	What's so important about Hoover Dam?
AID00143435	The Dam powers a lot of New Vegas. And then there's all that clean water lying in Lake Mead, too. Anybody who owns the Dam owns the territory.
AID00143436	Tell me about the Legion.
AID00143437	They're slavers, led by a guy named Caesar. Or Caesar. Not sure how you're supposed to say it.
AID00143438	A couple of years ago they tried to take over Hoover Dam, but the NCR beat them back. The NCR didn't - or couldn't - finish the job, though.
AID00143439	The Legion's got its strength back and is getting ready for another round at the Dam. My money's still on the NCR winning, but you never know.
AID00143440	We've been hearing stories about Legionaries on the Nevada side of the river, so keep a gun handy. You don't want to get caught by them.
AID00143441	What's wrong with the NCR?
AID00143442	Don't get me wrong - the NCR's got a lot of decent folk in it. It's just that they make you part of them whether you like it or not.
AID00143443	Towns like Goodsprings and Primm don't stay independent for long, not if you've got something the NCR wants. Still, the NCR keeps the Legion away.
AID00143444	No, I'm still working on it.
AID00143445	Remain diligent, outsider. If those patrols are in trouble, every second you delay lessens their chances of rescue.
AID00143446	I've found two of the patrols. All of the paladins were dead.
AID00143447	T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
AID00143448	Return when you have found them.
AID00143449	No, I've only found one of them so far. Both paladins were dead.
AID00143450	While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
AID00143451	See me as soon as you've found them.
AID00143452	Yes, here are their holotapes.
AID00143453	They were all dead, then. I suppose I'm not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
AID00143454	But we must turn our minds to other matters. When I sent out those patrols, I also sent three Knights out on scouting missions.
AID00143455	When the patrols failed to return, we assumed the worst and sent a single communication to the scouts to hold position and maintain radio silence.
AID00143456	I want you to contact those scouts and gather their reports. Like the patrols, they have devices on them that will enable you to track them.
AID00143457	When you find them, tell them you're my representative and ask them if the bears are still hunting. That should get them to talk to you.
AID00143458	Return when you've gathered all of their reports.
AID00143459	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I think she's dead.
AID00143460	What?! No! I mean, I haven't seen her around for a while, but I thought she was just busy working.
AID00143461	She was so beautiful... Now I'll never get to know her.
AID00143462	Well, you won't be getting any caps, but McLafferty won't be a problem for you.
AID00143463	Oh, I see. Well, I guess I'm off to see my admirer now.
AID00143464	<Black Widow>
AID00143465	You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
AID00143466	A "personal matter," hmm? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
AID00143467	I'd like to hear about that personal matter you mentioned.
AID00143468	I thought you weren't interested.
AID00143469	<Speech>
AID00143470	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
AID00143471	Take a deep breath and focus, Lindsay. Where were you with him last?
AID00143472	[FAILED] I don't know. I play all over. I'll never find him!
AID00143473	Any idea where I should start looking, kid?
AID00143474	I'll be going now.
AID00143475	Come back when you've made some progress.
AID00143476	[NCR] I'm here to assist.
AID00143477	Well, about time we got a soldier... and not a recruit, you look like you've seen some action.
AID00143478	Could use a resupply.
AID00143479	You mentioned a reward before?
AID00143480	No, I mentioned you might accidentally get supplied, and I meant it. Not allowed to contract mercenaries at the Outpost.
AID00143481	Still, a requisition form or two can get lost, and they're not going to come check... so here you go, just between us.
AID00143482	Just get it to the NCR government.
AID00143483	It felt like the right thing to do.
AID00143484	You're welcome.
AID00143485	I'll do what I can - and those folks that got killed need to be answered for.
AID00143486	If you can promise it gets where it needs to go.
AID00143487	I can promise that, what happens after... not even God himself could move the Congress in or out of session. And this... this is a tricky matter.
AID00143488	Sure... no problem.
AID00143489	Hmmm. All right - you change your mind and start shooting, then I can't help you. Show up here after, I'll put you in chains.
AID00143490	Get on now, I'll make sure this gets West and let the wheels of law start turning in the courts.
AID00143491	You have our word.
AID00143492	That'll have to do. God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
AID00143493	If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
AID00143494	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
AID00143495	God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
AID00143496	If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
AID00143497	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
AID00143498	Can you get it to the right people?
AID00143499	No. No, I can't. Because this evidence might be true... but it doesn't just implicate them.
AID00143500	It's a motive for what happened up North, someone went cruising through both compounds, killed them all.
AID00143501	I'm guessing that was you. If so, you're not leaving this outpost except in chains.
AID00143502	I can, if you make me a promise.
AID00143503	I need you to swear you won't take revenge on Gloria or Alice. If you do, then your case is over, and we can't see that justice is done.
AID00143504	I know some things are hard to let go, but you and Miss Cassidy need to understand that, hear me?
AID00143505	I have evidence of a caravan conspiracy.
AID00143506	What is it? Let me see.
AID00143507	All right. This is... this explains a lot of the lost caravans. I thought it was Legion work, but...
AID00143508	I've heard enough.
AID00143509	You sound frustrated.
AID00143510	Frustrated? No. I have my orders - signed, and approved all the way up the chain from Kimball. And I understand the reasons.
AID00143511	The Outpost isn't a Legion target, yet, not like Vegas or the Dam - but if the caravans get choked here, that's going to bite NCR hard.
AID00143512	Anyway, didn't mean to talk your ear off. Some days... just feel like more requisition forms and daily reports come across my desk than results.
AID00143513	Is NCR sending more troops?
AID00143514	Sending more troops, yes, to reinforce the Outpost, no. Troops head through here on their way to McCarran or to the frontlines at Forlorn Hope.
AID00143515	Or they're on leave, on their way to New Vegas to piss away their pay. All of them, passing through.
AID00143516	You sure seem like you have enough soldiers.
AID00143517	Soldiers, no, recruits, yes. And the Mojave Outpost has been ordered to have a standing force at the NCR perimeter at all times.
AID00143518	So sending anyone out reduces the Outpost's numbers and would be in direct violation of my orders from back West.
AID00143519	Let's move.
AID00143520	Got it, let's start looting.
AID00143521	Don't have to tell me twice, feel more alive than I ever have.
AID00143522	We'll make the time.
AID00143523	All right then, let's move out.
AID00143524	Want to check it out?
AID00143525	Yeah, something's wrong, I can feel it.
AID00143526	It's not any closer than the first, so if you'd rather let be, let me know.
AID00143527	Let's leave it for now.
AID00143528	If we have time, sure.
AID00143529	Let's go.
AID00143530	Want to go check it out?
AID00143531	Yeah, it's a ways, though, hell of a detour. You sure?
AID00143532	Is there anything salvagable?
AID00143533	Not sure, let's look around.
AID00143534	All right, let's check the place out.
AID00143535	Why would they have done it during the day?
AID00143536	No idea. Maybe catch the sun in their eyes? Maybe they wanted the caravan to come to them, walk into an ambush?
AID00143537	We should check the wagon, they may not have got everything.
AID00143538	Whatever we find, it's yours - least I can do for hoofing it all this way with me.
AID00143539	If there's time.
AID00143540	I may have already searched the area.
AID00143541	Well, you have to know what to look for.
AID00143542	Let's go, then.
AID00143543	Thanks, I appreciate it.
AID00143544	Some of the caravan might be ash, but we were expecting raiders and over-inquisitive NCR border guards. There might be something left.
AID00143545	If I'm there with you, shouldn't be hard to spot. And I'd prefer to see the bodies with my own eyes.
AID00143546	Already been there, nothing worth finding.
AID00143547	Well, I still wouldn't mind going there and crossing my heart a few times, if only to make me feel a bit better.
AID00143548	I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
AID00143549	Site's probably nothing but bones and sand by now.
AID00143550	Think there's anything left?
AID00143551	Only wishful thinking on my part, most likely. At the least, I'd like to pay my respects.
AID00143552	I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
AID00143553	How did you catch word of it?
AID00143554	Got word back on what happened from Rangers, guess they found enough in the wreckage to identify it.
AID00143555	Where was your caravan hit?
AID00143556	Up side of Vegas, hear tell. Trapped at the Mojave Outpost, so I wasn't able to run there when I heard.
AID00143557	Been weeks since it was hit, so the site's probably a Cazador nest by now.
AID00143558	After all the shit I went through to get this, we're going to Jackson.
AID00143559	If he won't listen, then we can do things your way.
AID00143560	We have to try.
AID00143561	All right, let's do it, listen to what he has to say.
AID00143562	Anyone you trust in NCR?
AID00143563	Well... Jackson in the Mojave Outpost could get it to folks in the West. I wouldn't trust anyone closer to the Colorado.
AID00143564	And the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs have their heart back West. Not sure it'll do any good, though.
AID00143565	You know Gloria and Alice - what do you think?
AID00143566	No one enters into a deal like this unless they have dirt on their partner.
AID00143567	No... No, I'd agree with that. And Alice and Gloria are two crows that'd keep something like that in their nest.
AID00143568	Because of what happened to your caravan.
AID00143569	You're saying... they might need to do the same thing to each other some day. And evidence is easier than bullets.
AID00143570	Not yet.
AID00143571	I held off on filling them full of holes, so unless you give me a good reason to cool my heels soon, I'm not waiting much longer.
AID00143572	Here's both pieces of evidence.
AID00143573	No shit. There it is, the blood, the motive, as clear as day. They must have penned these with snake venom.
AID00143574	But... we got it, now what? Sure, this damns them, but only if someone listens.
AID00143575	Here's the evidence of the deal. Without its twin, there's no proof.
AID00143576	So there's just one more safe to crack? Hope you can get to it.
AID00143577	Say what you will about the two leading ladies, they watch their lockers like crows. Still... you got one, so the other might not be impossible.
AID00143578	If you get both, then let's talk. And... I appreciate you putting yourself at risk like this. Thanks.
AID00143579	If I can get the evidence, will you consider it?
AID00143580	The harm to the Van Graffs would last longer - and travel back West.
AID00143581	All right, if you poke around the Van Graffs and Alice, fine.
AID00143582	But if I see either one, go into their camp? I'm going to start shooting, no matter what you find.
AID00143583	There's another way - we can get evidence, let NCR take them down.
AID00143584	NCR? Are you out of your fucking mind?
AID00143585	That'd take years... and with the war with the Legion, no way they're going to waste time running up the Crimson Caravan or the Van Graffs!
AID00143586	And what makes you think any evidence can be found?
AID00143587	I'm for that, let's go kill them.
AID00143588	Don't care much for which one we kill first, whether settling accounts with McLafferty or making that bitch Gloria eat her hair.
AID00143589	The Van Graffs are going to be tougher, so we'll likely get killed there. If we go to the Crimson Caravan camp, we'll just need a lot of bullets.
AID00143590	Still, we give the Van Graffs the what-for, that means all those guns they used on my caravan - we can take and use on the Crimson Caravan.
AID00143591	Chasing the dead with more deaths isn't the way.
AID00143592	Better than the alternative.
AID00143593	No... no, I know. Just hard to say how I feel right now.
AID00143594	Are you all right?
AID00143595	Feels... I don't know. I guess I feel relieved. I don't know what I feel.
AID00143596	Wait, that's not true. I think the NCR back West, when riled, is going to be the worst enemy the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan ever had.
AID00143597	They're all so mired in procedure and paper out there, the kind of evidence we gave is going to be worse than shooting them.
AID00143598	I think that settles accounts with me - and my men. That was some tricky political maneuvering, but worth it, even if it takes a few years.
AID00143599	You're welcome. Let's go.
AID00143600	So that's it, then.
AID00143601	That's it. Except for one thing... thanks.
AID00143602	Not many people in my company would have done what you did for me without some hesitation or asking me to cool down.
AID00143603	But you backed me, even when the odds were against us. Words aren't enough, but - thanks.
AID00143604	You all right?
AID00143605	Yeah... yeah, I am. Never realized had all that anger in me. Makes me wonder how much more I can settle with bullets.
AID00143606	You know, when I first heard about them, I was so mad, but there was this little part of me that said, "you can't do to them what they did to you."
AID00143607	I say fuck that part. I feel purified, and I love the fact that there's no more loose ends.
AID00143608	Time to move on.
AID00143609	Got it. Let's loot the place.
AID00143610	Music to my ears.
AID00143611	You sure you want to do this?
AID00143612	Oh, I'm sure. Killing never felt so good, could almost hear the dead behind me guiding my hand.
AID00143613	Now that that bitch is in hell, they'll have a shot at her, too. So what are we waiting for? We've got more work to do.
AID00143614	Any thoughts on the Legion?
AID00143615	What do you mean?
AID00143616	Some caravans deal with the Legion now because the security. If towns could get the same protection? A lot more tempting than you'd think.
AID00143617	A bunch of people would be willing to side with the Legion to not have to worry about Fiends and Boomers and Powder Ganger attacks.
AID00143618	It's not hard for some folks to sell freedom when the alternative is worse. Especially if being with NCR is going to get you on a Legion cross.
AID00143619	There's other alternatives.
AID00143620	Look... and what I'm about to say, I don't mean as any offense to you, I know where your sympathies lie.
AID00143621	So what's the alternative?
AID00143622	Look, don't get me wrong.
AID00143623	I wouldn't want the Brotherhood or the Followers or the Vegas families running the Mojave, all of them are a different kind of fuck-up.
AID00143624	NCR just has some shaping up to do. Maybe Caesar kicking them in the nuts is a nice wake-up call, is all I'm saying.
AID00143625	I just wish Caesar would kick the heads of NCR, not the feet. I've fucked a soldier in my time - they don't need to get fucked by their orders.
AID00143626	So the Mojave suffers.
AID00143627	Aside from the people in the towns, it's the soldiers that suffer for it most.
AID00143628	Ever seen NCR troops asked to go after gangs at three-to-one odds? That bear flag doesn't make them bulletproof.
AID00143629	And  when those gangs were caused by NCR in the first place, like the Powder Gangers? Caesar on a crutch, don't get me started there.
AID00143630	Back to NCR.
AID00143631	Yeah, I got that part, thanks.
AID00143632	So NCR, tries to hold on to everything. They can't, because it's too big for them to get their arms around.
AID00143633	They can't guard the roads, they can't put a line of troops around the Mojave... it's just greed that makes the heads back West even try.
AID00143634	So they lack direction?
AID00143635	They try to put their stake in everything they see.
AID00143636	Nobody's dick's that long, not even Long Dick Johnson, and he had a fucking long dick. Thus, the name.
AID00143637	You support it no matter what?
AID00143638	I'm not some blind, flag-saluting do-as-they-will NCR lover. They're family, but let me tell you what family means.
AID00143639	You ever had a brother? Some dumbass younger brother, say, who knocked up the pastor's daughter, can't hold a job, and his home-away is a jail cell?
AID00143640	That's NCR. Their compass is spinning, all the time.
AID00143641	There's a "but" in there.
AID00143642	Yeah, there is.
AID00143643	What do you think of NCR?
AID00143644	NCR's my country, and I support it. Anyone who says otherwise, I'll feed them my knee.
AID00143645	I know which side of the firing line I'm on in the Mojave, just so you know.
AID00143646	Any other differences between Legion and NCR?
AID00143647	Much as I hate the Legion, caravan life would be a hell of a lot easier if they ran the roads.
AID00143648	Well, as long as those companies were run by men. And that's the biggest issue I see.
AID00143649	And it's a shame, but I think there's people on the NCR side who feel more strongly than I do.
AID00143650	There must be good parts to the Republic.
AID00143651	NCR tries. It's just that trying doesn't mean a whole lot when you're paying your respects to the dead.
AID00143652	And Legion, from what I've heard, they don't do the "stop tolls" on the roads or in the outposts like some NCR quartermasters do.
AID00143653	You're lucky if you turn a profit sometimes if some new officer gets assigned a route, the fees just get worse.
AID00143654	NCR sounds like it has a lot to answer for.
AID00143655	You sound frustrated.
AID00143656	I am. If NCR took the same stand and committed patrols to the roads, then I think that'd solve a lot of their problems right there.
AID00143657	But they don't. Caravans get butchered in the Mojave all the time, like mine. And so fucking close to Vegas, you could see it from the wall.
AID00143658	Do they deal with any caravans at all?
AID00143659	There's some caravans that deal with the Legion, yes. And as much as it pains me to say it, any caravan marked by the Legion is safe as houses.
AID00143660	They guard their roads, their supply lines - even Fiends would hesitate before going after any trader dealing with Legion.
AID00143661	All right, just asking.
AID00143662	Look, not meaning to fly off the handle like that.
AID00143663	What about Caesar's Legion?
AID00143664	The Legion? What about them?
AID00143665	I don't trade caps or supply anyone who keeps slaves, and treats women like Brahmin in those... "camps" of theirs.
AID00143666	Do you deal mostly with NCR?
AID00143667	Anyone wise does. Vegas families pay on time, from what I've heard - even the Omertas. The White Gloves pay on time, but they're... creepy.
AID00143668	Deal with anyone else, though, you're taking a big risk.
AID00143669	And caravan life's the same way?
AID00143670	The Caravan fighting here in the Mojave... it's been downright brutal. The amount of caravan space you reserve for ammo alone...
AID00143671	And if it's not raiders, Powder Gangers, it's NCR tolls. They need to get the money from somewhere, even if it's Vegas-bound.
AID00143672	[Ladykiller] Miss Cassidy... are you flirting with me?
AID00143673	Don't take that as anything more than my words. I bet you're a real sweetheart the way you leave that trail of broken-hearts behind you.
AID00143674	I know your look, you probably say all the right things... so we're clear, nothing's going to happen between us. You'd best respect that.
AID00143675	[Confirmed Bachelor] As long as we keep it on that level.
AID00143676	What? Oh. All right. Guess you've got a Legion outlook on things. No problems here, there's a lot more of that in the Mojave than you see.
AID00143677	Not sure I understand your answer.
AID00143678	[Black Widow] Soft men don't stay that way around me, I've found.
AID00143679	Well, don't let the soldiers drink too much, and I'd agree with you most time. Fucking whiskey dicks.
AID00143680	[Cherchez La Femme] That's... rarely an issue.
AID00143681	What? Oh. Damn, no offense meant. Sometimes I get so drunk, I don't care who I share a bed with, so that's fine with me.
AID00143682	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
AID00143683	How's caravan life in the Mojave?
AID00143684	Well, I'm not one for soft living... or soft men, let me tell you. I'm guessing neither are you.
AID00143685	Well, I'm not one for soft living or soft men, let me tell you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to you right now - on both counts.
AID00143686	What, like a courier?
AID00143687	Well, not as glamorous, I guess - roads back West were safer in most places. Most.
AID00143688	Anyway, occurred to me I could scratch the traveling itch and get paid for it. Cassidy Caravans formed around me, rest is history.
AID00143689	So you traveled a lot.
AID00143690	Yeah. West, East - and passed through places enough times people would sometimes pay me some caps to take something to the next town.
AID00143691	So you just started in the caravan...?
AID00143692	Actually, it sort of fell on me. My feet get antsy if I stay in one place, like the Mojave Outpost.
AID00143693	Was driving me crazy, that feeling of being trapped there, so thanks for that.
AID00143694	[Intelligence] I'm familiar. Do *you* know what a fish is?
AID00143695	Well... of course I do.
AID00143696	What the hell is a fish?
AID00143697	It's this... slimy, scaled thing, like a Lakelurk, except no legs. Well, most times. They're like birds, except they stay underwater.
AID00143698	Anyway, I've seen pictures. One guy even had one above his bar in Redding, except it was made of Pre-War plastic.
AID00143699	Used to say it could sing, but I figured he was on a Jet rush.
AID00143700	How'd you get started in the caravan business?
AID00143701	Started? Took to it like a fish to water... well, if you know what a fish is.
AID00143702	Can we talk about something else?
AID00143703	Oh. Well, all right.
AID00143704	Have you lived here a long time?
AID00143705	What do I do now?
AID00143706	You shouldn't have gone through my stuff.
AID00143707	Didn't have much choice, I'm afraid. But I understand the sentiment.
AID00143708	Thanks for patching me up, Doc.
AID00143709	Don't mention it. It's what I'm here for.
AID00143710	Let me think about it.
AID00143711	It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get our support.
AID00143712	Yes. Tell the troops to come protect Primm.
AID00143713	Roger, I'll radio them over now.
AID00143714	Not yet, but I will soon.
AID00143715	Roger.
AID00143716	Who did you say I should talk to again?
AID00143717	Knight, he's at Mojave outpost.
AID00143718	Can you tell me anything about this Platinum Chip?
AID00143719	Well, no idea why your friend Mr. House wants it, but I'm guessing it's not for the caps.
AID00143720	Must've been one huge metal Bighorner that crapped that chip out.
AID00143721	My guess? Leads to a big cashout at some casino - and if the "38" on it is any indication... well... Lucky 38 it is.
AID00143722	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
AID00143723	Much as anyone else. Cazador trap - you fly in, the city sucks a pint out of you, then you're out on the street.
AID00143724	NCR makes a habit of going there and dumping cash, only the Strip gets fat off it.
AID00143725	Couldn't tell you much more than that. Not really one for New Vegas when there's enough dumpwater bars in the Mojave to last me.
AID00143726	FollowersStealthing
AID00143727	Bad guys won't see us coming.
AID00143728	Shhhh... we're hunting shitheads.
AID00143729	Holding my breath.
AID00143730	Keeping quiet.
AID00143731	O... kay. I'll do my best.
AID00143732	Just as a warning, my covert bandaging skills are a little rusty.
AID00143733	Staying low.
AID00143734	Keeping quiet... unless my creaking knees give us away.
AID00143735	Sure, boss. The old man will crawl around in the dirt to keep hidden.
AID00143736	This crouch-walking is hell on my back, boss.
AID00143737	Right, because a ghoul in a vaquero outfit is really going to blend in with the scenery.
AID00143738	Oh, don't you worry about me, dearie, your grandma knows how to stay quiet.

AID00143764	That was lower than low.
AID00143765	<Do Not Translate>
AID00143766	That night, Cass kicked in the door of his room to celebrate, only to find the man on the bed was an NCR soldier whose barracks had been destroyed.
AID00143767	He was cute, though, so after having her way with him, she got the hell out, leaving an empty whiskey bottle as a note.
AID00143768	As she walked along the Dam in the night, she felt drunk, content, and happy to be alive. Which to her, was the whole point of it all.
AID00143769	<Do Not Translate>
AID00143770	She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of himself, then she figured he knew that already.

AID00143772	So she laughed, said fuck it all, and raised a bottle to the Dam and the ones who had fought for it.
AID00143773	As far as she was concerned, the whole thing was proof that playing out a bad hand can pay off in the end...
AID00143774	...as long as someone like the Courier was holding the cards.
AID00143775	...as long as a woman like the Courier was holding the cards.

AID00143777	Okay children, it's time to read another chapter from The Patriot's Cookbook.
AID00143778	Today, children, we are going to read another chapter from True Police Stories.
AID00143779	Children, today we're going to read more from the Milsurp Review.
AID00143780	For today's studies, please read the next chapter in Programmer's Digest.
AID00143781	Okay children, today we are going to be reading Lad's Life.
AID00143782	Science
AID00143783	Speech
AID00143784	[SUCCEEDED] I like the way you think. Oratory may indeed be a useful tool in our arsenal if wielded effectively.
AID00143785	I'll put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
AID00143786	Talking enemies down is an effective way to get what you want and save ammo.
AID00143787	[FAILED] Talking? Seriously? Sorry pal, but nothing is more persuasive than bullets and bombs, and we're the experts!
AID00143788	I could probably put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
AID00143789	I think I can teach you things about public speaking.
AID00143790	Barter
AID00143791	[SUCCEEDED] That sounds good for teaching the kids how to negotiate prices. I keep saying we need to open trade with the outside, but no one listens.
AID00143792	There are some key principles to stick to when it comes to bartering with traders.
AID00143793	[FAILED] It doesn't look like we're going to be trading with anyone outside of Nellis anytime soon, so I'd rather not bother.
AID00143794	I could teach you some tricks about trading.
AID00143795	Guns
AID00143796	[SUCCEEDED] Wow, our stockpiles mostly included full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
AID00143797	I can teach how to make jacketed hollow points and other specialized ammo.
AID00143798	[FAILED] Look around Nellis. We've got a stockpile of weapons, and we've all spent plenty of time at the range.
AID00143799	I appreciate the sentiment, but there isn't much you could teach us when it comes to firearms.
AID00143800	I bet I could teach you a thing or two about shooting.
AID00143801	Repair
AID00143802	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, that's a great idea! This information might help with our training manuals, and maybe create a few new apprentices for Loyal.
AID00143803	I've done a lot of machining and lathe work over the years. I could write up a booklet for you.
AID00143804	[FAILED] Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
AID00143805	Oh the stories I could tell you about fixing stuff with duct tape and bubble gum!
AID00143806	Let's talk about something else.
AID00143807	Okay.
AID00143808	Anything else?
AID00143809	Well, up north a ways you'll see a big tower. That's HELIOS One. Used to be a power plant in its day.
AID00143810	And there's a town just east of here called Nelson. Used to be such a quaint little place until those slavers took it over.
AID00143811	But we got our wonderful snipers keeping an eye in that direction, and so far the slavers have left us alone.
AID00143812	VFreeformGoodspringsTributeOfTerror
AID00143813	Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
AID00143814	We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
AID00143815	We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
AID00143816	< Speech 60 >
AID00143817	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. Never had you pegged for the drill instructor type, but you got my attention.
AID00143818	You can tell the Lieutenant that I finally caved. I'll... get help. There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
AID00143819	You're a weak link. I know it, you know it, and First Recon knows it. Do something about it.
AID00143820	[FAILED] "People" ought to mind their own business.
AID00143821	Just get the help. People are worried about you.
AID00143822	Corporal Betsy from First Recon will be coming to you for mental treatment.
AID00143823	Mental trauma can be just as debilitating as physical injuries. Fortunately, I'm well-qualified in such treatment. I'll make time in my schedule.
AID00143824	I'm assuming you're referring to mental trauma. I'll make time in my schedule.
AID00143825	Sterling said that if he'd let his pride get in the way, he wouldn't be in First Recon.
AID00143826	I always wondered about that. First Recon is elite, but the rangers... I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that kind of status.
AID00143827	Bitter-Root admitted that Usanagi was able to help him with his problems.
AID00143828	Bitter-Root actually said that? I can't see him talking about his problems to anybody, much less admitting that someone else actually helped him.
AID00143829	10 of Spades says his stuttering got better because of Usanagi.
AID00143830	He got better? If he says so. Anyway, 10 of Spades is a good kid - maybe I ought to listen to him for once.
AID00143831	I'm guessing the other two had similar things to say. All right, consider me convinced. I'll go see Usanagi.
AID00143832	You can tell the Lieutenant that I caved. And... thanks.
AID00143833	The rest of First Recon all agree that you should go see Doctor Usanagi.
AID00143834	This was none of their business - or yours. You've got no right to talk to people behind my back about this.
AID00143835	I'm trying to get Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. I heard you saw Usanagi yourself.
AID00143836	10 of Spades really ought to keep his mouth shut, but he's right. There were a lot of things in my past I just couldn't leave behind.
AID00143837	It helped. A little. Well, more than a little. Betsy ought to pay a visit to Usanagi since it can't hurt none.
AID00143838	You're right - we've never met.
AID00143839	Good to know.
AID00143840	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
AID00143841	It's a pride thing with her, and totally unnecessary. I mean, look at me - I was Ranger Sterling until the Legion got through with me.
AID00143842	I was bitter, but if I'd kept my mouth shut, the NCR would've discharged me and sent me home. Instead, I asked if there was still a place for me.
AID00143843	I had to prove I could still handle a gun alongside all the recruits, but look at me now - First Recon and still going strong. You tell Betsy that.
AID00143844	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
AID00143845	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
AID00143846	She... helped? You sure about that?
AID00143847	Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
AID00143848	Thanks for the tip.
AID00143849	N-no problem.
AID00143850	I'm trying to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. Any ideas?
AID00143851	Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
AID00143852	The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
AID00143853	I convinced Corporal Betsy to get help from Doctor Usanagi.
AID00143854	Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with her treatment as long as it's necessary.
AID00143855	I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels its taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
AID00143856	I caught the tail end of what you said to her. Betsy looked like she'd been slapped right back into basic for a few seconds there.
AID00143857	Let's hope that Betsy sticks with the treatment. Knowing her, she won't keep seeing Usanagi if she feels things are taking too long.
AID00143858	I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with her treatment because of what you said.
AID00143859	I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
AID00143860	Do me a favor and let Usanagi know Corporal Betsy is coming. I'd like to make sure the medical clinic has time for her.
AID00143861	Anything else you can tell me about Great Khans?
AID00143862	They're tough sons of bitches, mean but not crazy - they'll leave you alone unless you've got something they want.
AID00143863	The Great Khans deal in illegal chems. There's a good chance that most chems you come across were made by Great Khans.
AID00143864	Why are the Nightkin here in Jacobstown?
AID00143865	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. Jacobstown was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place to find a cure.
AID00143866	Instead, we wait and wait. I'm sick of waiting.
AID00143867	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. But, thanks to you, it seems a cure is on the way at last.
AID00143868	Why do you think you let Betsy down?
AID00143869	She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
AID00143870	Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
AID00143871	She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit.
AID00143872	If you were unconscious, how could you have done anything?
AID00143873	Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place.
AID00143874	That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
AID00143875	Doctor Usanagi at the New Vegas Medical Clinic can help you.
AID00143876	< Medicine 40 >
AID00143877	[SUCCEEDED] Just another injury to take care of, huh? Well, when you put it that way... all right. You can tell the Lieutenant I finally caved.
AID00143878	There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
AID00143879	Mental trauma can slow you down or distract you, but it's treatable - just like any bullet wound.
AID00143880	[FAILED] I already told you that I'm fine. I don't need a head doc.
AID00143881	Just get the help. You'll feel better, I promise.
AID00143882	You should get medical help for your trauma.
AID00143883	The Lieutenant's been talking to you, hasn't he? Look, I don't need a head doctor - I'm First Recon, damn it.
AID00143884	You don't see the others crying about every little bruise and scrape, do you?
AID00143885	I can talk to Betsy about getting medical help for her trauma, if you want.
AID00143886	I'd appreciate it. As her CO, I could order her to get help, but I'd have her agree with the idea.
AID00143887	Yes. Talk to Betsy and try to convince her to get medical help for her trauma. I sure hope you understand what I'm asking.
AID00143888	What happened to Sterling?
AID00143889	Corporal Sterling was an NCR ranger until he was captured by the Legion. They tortured him pretty badly.
AID00143890	He wasn't able to be a ranger after that, but his eyes are still sharp so I had him transferred to First Recon.
AID00143891	What's wrong with Betsy?
AID00143892	Cook-Cook, one of the fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
AID00143893	Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
AID00143894	It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
AID00143895	RaulPvtEdwards
AID00143896	Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad. Sure, your skin rots off and you start to stink like a public toilet after Cinco de Mayo, but... umm....
AID00143897	What? How is that not bad? In fact, how could it get worse?
AID00143898	Well, assuming you survive the radiation sickness, the lynch mobs, and the possibility of going feral, one day you'll get old and decrepit, like me.
AID00143899	Oh god!
AID00143900	What? Was it something I said?
AID00143901	RaulFestus
AID00143902	It's like looking into a mirror. A tacky, cowboy-festooned mirror.
AID00143903	RaulHooverDam
AID00143904	I can't believe I'm about to do this, boss. If I buy it out there, I want twelve mariachi bands playing at my funeral. A medal might be nice, too.
AID00143905	RaulForlornHope
AID00143906	Eesh. These soldiers look how I feel, boss.
AID00143907	RaulPvtEdwards
AID00143908	RaulSearchlight
AID00143909	I guess hunting down ghouls like wild animals is okay. I mean, they're probably going to die anyways, right boss?
AID00143910	RaulPvtHalford
AID00143911	Ah, he's young, boss. He'll bounce back. Unlike some of us.
AID00143912	RaulTabitha
AID00143913	That wig is going to haunt my nightmares. Seriously.
AID00143914	RaulHanlon
AID00143915	See, that's why you should retire before your brain goes. Oh. Sorry, boss. Bad choice of words.
AID00143916	RaulJacobstown
AID00143917	Just putting this out there, boss: if these Super mutants kidnap us and force us to fix toasters for them, it's on you.
AID00143918	RaulREPCON
AID00143919	Hey, I'm one of you! Don't eat me, eat the smoothskin! Oh, uh, sorry boss.
AID00143920	Lots of older people are still useful to their friends and communities.
AID00143921	Yeah? Maybe you can introduce them to me if we find them, because I've never met one.
AID00143922	I don't have time for a game right now.
AID00143923	All right.
AID00143924	Let's play.
AID00143925	Don't worry - I'm not that good of a player.
AID00143926	No, not yet.
AID00143927	Well, return when you have.
AID00143928	Yes, I did. Here are their reports.
AID00143929	Good, let's take a look... Hmmm, if I'm reading this right, it appears that the NCR's grip on this region is nowhere near as firm as I thought.
AID00143930	I'll have to review these in detail, but these reports have given me much to think about. Thank you, outsider.
AID00143931	You've become someone I can count on, so I believe I can share something rather confidential with you.
AID00143932	I'm not going anywhere with you.
AID00143933	Your call.
AID00143934	I appear to be lost. I'll just head back the way I came in.
AID00143935	Not on my watch you won't. You either go with me to the Elder or I put you in the ground right here. Choose.
AID00143936	HVHardinSoundsPlayerOut
AID00143937	So, you're the outsider that's been given leave to wander around freely. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.
AID00143938	Name's Hardin. I'm the Head Paladin of this chapter, and I think we might be able to help each other out.
AID00143939	I don't know what the Elder talked to you about, but I can tell you this chapter is in trouble, and he's at the center of it.
AID00143940	Are you willing to listen to what I have to say?
AID00143941	I'm still looking for them.
AID00143942	Please make all haste in your search. It is imperative that I know the results of his mission.
AID00143943	I did. Lorenzo's on it.
AID00143944	Good news for a change. Your efforts have humbled me, outsider. You have done more than I could expect, even from my Brothers.
AID00143945	Moreover, I've been going over the scouts' reports and keep coming up with the same conclusion. The NCR is not the threat I've believed it to be.
AID00143946	We should not have had to rely on your help in this crisis. I believed my actions were guided by caution and prudence, but I now see the truth.
AID00143947	People called me a hero after what happened at HELIOS, but I left that battle scarred by fear, and have allowed that weakness to govern my actions.
AID00143948	That ends now. I will undo the wrong I have done my brethren, and lift the lockdown. With luck, we will once again flourish.
AID00143949	Please, take this. It is a small token of my thanks, and scarcely begins to repay the debt owed you, but is all I am allowed to give an outsider.
AID00143950	This key will allow you to use our safehouse to the northeast. I hope it will prove useful in your travels.
AID00143951	What was the job you mentioned before?
AID00143952	Interested now? All right.
AID00143953	If that's all you wanted, I'm done.
AID00143954	Well, thanks for hoofing it there and back, even if it was bad news. Wish we could spare the troops to go hunting, but... orders are to stay put.
AID00143955	Fucking Mojave's going to hell, and all I can do is sit here and watch.
AID00143956	Didn't mean to be the bearer of bad news.
AID00143957	Unless you burned the town, don't take blame that's not due. Things are going to get uglier before the year's out.
AID00143958	Did you have friends there?
AID00143959	In Nipton? Hell no. Town was a shithole, asking to be burned. Just not by Legion. Nobody deserves that.
AID00143960	Town's been attacked, not sure by who.
AID00143961	Well, if you didn't see anyone, they might be gone - be just like Powder Gangers to hit and run.
AID00143962	See what you can find in the Town Hall, there might be survivors.
AID00143963	Legion turned that sinkhole into a graveyard.
AID00143964	Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
AID00143965	If I pass through there, I'll check it out.
AID00143966	Better than nothing. But close to it.
AID00143967	Not interested.
AID00143968	Had to try. Smoke trail's getting thicker by the hour - wish Jackson could spare some men.
AID00143969	I'll do it.
AID00143970	All right. Look at you, all fired up and ready to go. Wish the others around here had that kind of attitude.
AID00143971	Listen - I don't want you getting killed for this, so if you head there and run into trouble, I'm asking for eyes and ears, not your life. All right?
AID00143972	Legion turned that sinkhole into a graveyard.
AID00143973	What's the problem?
AID00143974	Hear any news from the West?
AID00143975	Kimball's Kimball, not sure which end is his ass or his head. Caravan families are causing trouble, Big Circle getting tense - the usual.
AID00143976	Look, you want gossip, go to the bar downstairs and listen to a whole lot of nothing. Me, I got to keep watch, then fill out the daily log.
AID00143977	Why don't you go check it out?
AID00143978	Got my post. Don't think I wouldn't go, too - if trouble's hit Nipton, town's got enough camping spots to rack up some easy kills.
AID00143979	Not about to have Jackson bust my ass again, though, even if I came back with Caesar's head - rather be sitting here than in a cell.
AID00143980	Already been there, Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
AID00143981	Legion this far West? You're fucking kidding me.
AID00143982	That's not outside the border, they're moving in - and fast. Nipton wasn't the most friendly town, but...
AID00143983	All right - thanks for checking on that, wish it set my mind at ease, now I'm more on edge than ever.
AID00143984	[NCR] If I can help, I'm here to assist.
AID00143985	Hnh. Maybe Jackson got some additional soldiers after all. Didn't take you for a trooper at first, you seem a little... livelier than most.
AID00143986	All right, if you're here to assist, good, that's what I want to hear.
AID00143987	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
AID00143988	Not much to tell, one of the worst posts in the NCR if you're looking to be anything more than a babysitter.
AID00143989	Full up here, but just enough so we can't send out patrols. Got to maintain a "standing force," Jackson's orders... NCR's orders.
AID00143990	Can't spare men for patrols or escorts, so caravans are backing up here like a Brahmin with a bottle in its ass. Typical NCR bullshit.
AID00143991	Never mind, I'll be going now.
AID00143992	Mind yourself on the plank going down.
AID00143993	What's the pay?
AID00143994	The pay? The pay is a good goddamn thanks from the heart of the Republic!
AID00143995	Just shitting you with the NCR line, done wonders for morale around here. President Kimball keeps saying getting shot at is its own damn reward.
AID00143996	Do this job for me, though, I'll do what I can. People know I hate most everyone, so if I put in a word for you... that's gold.
AID00143997	Depends on the work.
AID00143998	I think there's trouble in Nipton - no traffic from there on the roads, and while I can explain that away, the smoke from the town I can't.
AID00143999	I'm sure it's been hit - what I need to know is if they survived it. Might be Powder Gangers with all that smoke in the air.
AID00144000	If there's anybody left, they'd be in the Nipton Town Hall. Go there, check it out, let me know what you find.
AID00144001	Know anything about Mr. House?
AID00144002	Not much, and I haven't had occasion to look for anything more than that.
AID00144003	I've heard what most people know... he's said to run New Vegas, he runs the robots, but... well, no one's really seen him.
AID00144004	Well, except you, that is.
AID00144005	Of course, no one really will now that he's dead. Good thing, too, no idea what that contraption was on his pecker.
AID00144006	So if he wants to see you... well, that's a rare thing I wouldn't turn down. I'd ask him some hard questions if I were you.
AID00144007	VCassWhiskeyRosePerk
AID00144008	That hit the spot.
AID00144009	All right, now for some ass-kicking.
AID00144010	Pass the bottle.
AID00144011	Now all I need is some shame to wash it down with.
AID00144012	Bottoms up.
AID00144013	Oh, now, there goes the pain.

AID00144016	VCassPayRespect
AID00144017	VCassLookAround
AID00144018	Any idea what was up at the site of the last caravan?
AID00144019	Not sure yet, something's definitely wrong. They were massacred, we should look around, find out why.
AID00144020	See anything at the second caravan site?
AID00144021	Nothing yet, but... something's there. Just got to look around and find it.
AID00144022	See anything at the caravan site?
AID00144023	No... still eating at me, though. Wouldn't mind taking another look. Something's off.
AID00144024	I think we should explore the next one, see what's up. Got my curiosity riled.
AID00144025	Let's do it, then.
AID00144026	Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
AID00144027	Goodbye.
AID00144028	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
AID00144029	Goodbye.
AID00144030	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
AID00144031	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AID00144032	Goodbye.
AID00144033	How about a Vault trinket in exchange for my help?
AID00144034	Don't mention it, your freedom is enough reward for me.
AID00144035	Goodbye.
AID00144036	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AID00144037	Goodbye.
AID00144038	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AID00144039	Goodbye.
AID00144040	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AID00144041	I could use a Vault trinket.
AID00144042	Of course, please, take this! We carried as much useful technology as we could, before our journey into the surface world.
AID00144043	I don't need anything in return for my help.
AID00144044	It fills me with hope to see that people from the surface world are kind, and brave. Again, thank you.
AID00144045	Goodbye.
AID00144046	Until soon, I hope, outlander.
AID00144047	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AID00144048	Kindly! The leaders of this fine community have accepted us among them. They give us food and protection from the outside.
AID00144049	Some people here seem extremely unhappy. They keep talking about getting "shafted," "swindled," and "fucked."
AID00144050	Apparently somebody did them ill, all the way inside the surface-city with lights - the Strip, and Freeside, they call it.
AID00144051	We're lucky to be here, alive and well. The land's a mystery to us, but we'll find our place in it.
AID00144052	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
AID00144053	You? Did you re-direct the power stream back to our section?
AID00144054	We thought nobody would ever manage to get past the radiation, and the ghouls!
AID00144055	We owe you our freedom, outlander. Please, if there's anything we can do for you...
AID00144056	Yes, I believe that, outlander. We owe you our freedom.
AID00144057	As I said, I saved you from being trapped down in Vault 34.
AID00144058	VCassJBCPostAttack
AID00144059	What the hell was that all about?
AID00144060	VCassJBCAttack
AID00144061	What the hell is this shit?
AID00144062	Interested in... uh... following me to Freeside?
AID00144063	I'm already shadowing you, aren't I? Lead on, I'll follow.
AID00144064	Ask me to come with you, I'll think about it on the way.
AID00144065	Not leaving here until my caravan papers clear, or my title goes away.
AID00144066	If you were looking for someone to caravan with, I'd try the Crimson Caravan up north. They pretty much run the roads now.
AID00144067	Don't know, not sure where to head to next.
AID00144068	He's with the Van Graffs.
AID00144069	The only Van Graffs I know are the ones out West - well, except for Gloria Van Graff, and I don't know her all that well, nor do I want to.
AID00144070	Don't have any objections speaking with him, though if he's with the Van Graffs, he should know I'm not looking to buy weapons.
AID00144071	Jean-Baptiste in Freeside wanted to meet with you.
AID00144072	"Jean-Baptiste?" Sounds like someone got knocked out of the good book so hard his name broke.
AID00144073	Either that or it's Canadarian or some such shit. So who is this... "Baptiste" and what does he want?
AID00144074	What makes the surplus ammo inferior?
AID00144075	It's all about quantity over quality. Trouble is, you'll be cleaning and fixing your gun a lot more than usual when you use those kind of bullets.
AID00144076	Tell me about weapon mods and special ammo.
AID00144077	Weapon mods are things like silencers, scopes, bigger magazines.
AID00144078	Special ammo includes things like armor-piercing bullets which don't hurt the target as much but let you punch through armor easier.
AID00144079	There's also hollowpoint bullets which have the opposite effect - you can kill unarmored targets easier, but they don't do shit against armor.
AID00144080	For how long will I get this benefit?
AID00144081	Stay an ally of the Legion and we will share our loot with you. If you start working against us - or become an enemy - our deal ends.
AID00144082	How long will I get this benefit?
AID00144083	As long as you don't become an outright enemy of the Legion, payment will continue.
AID00144084	I have some things to take care of before the battle.
AID00144085	Then handle them with dispatch. The Legion's assault is imminent.
AID00144086	I'm ready. Let's finish this.
AID00144087	We've accomplished a great deal, you and I. One last task, and our work is complete. I'll see you in the control room.
AID00144088	If you're going to shoot, you'd better not miss.
AID00144089	I'm not an enemy, if that's what you're asking.
AID00144090	Sorry about the gun. You just caught me off guard, that's all.
AID00144091	We got off to a bad start. What say we start over with a friendly game of Caravan? You know how to play?
AID00144092	I'm just having a look around.
AID00144093	I see.
AID00144094	Did you want something else?
AID00144095	I have some questions first.
AID00144096	What do you know about the other group?
AID00144097	Got a funny name. Call themselves Caesar's Legion. Never seen 'em in these parts, so I couldn't tell you much.
AID00144098	I hear rumors, that's about it. Supposedly they keep slaves and they got some real nasty ways of killing folks.
AID00144099	But maybe that's just something folks in the NCR cooked up to make themselves seem more useful here. Less uninvited.
AID00144100	What does the NCR keep you safe from?
AID00144101	Well, the wildlife for one thing. Rowdy locals for another.
AID00144102	They're protecting their own. Just happens to help us.
AID00144103	They've been holding off this other group from the East, too.
AID00144104	Cass isn't around anymore, so I won't be able to complete the negotiation for you.
AID00144105	A pity. I guess I'll have to find some other way to acquire her caravan's assets. Thanks for letting me know.
AID00144106	If you run the town, they'll have to work for you. Food, water, and money will be yours.
AID00144107	Shit, yeah. Mayor Cobb - I like the sound of that. Running my own town will give me more pull with the guys at the prison, too.
AID00144108	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
AID00144109	Tell me about the NCR.
AID00144110	"New" California Republic - nothing new about it. Just a bunch of people with money and power pushing everyone else around.
AID00144111	They've got troops all over the Mojave, but it's a big desert so it's pretty easy to avoid them if you want.
AID00144112	What do you know about the Legion?
AID00144113	I've run with some tough gangs, but I gotta admit they all got nothing on the Legion. I hear they stick you up on poles and it takes awhile to die.
AID00144114	I ain't saying I'm afraid of them or nothing, but I'll be staying out of their way.
AID00144115	What's been going on in the rest of the wasteland?
AID00144116	Same old shit that's been going on for years. The NCR and Legion are still fighting over Hoover Dam for some reason.
AID00144117	Forget I said anything.
AID00144118	Make up your damn mind.
AID00144119	Free food, I guess.
AID00144120	Having all the food we want ain't a bad idea, actually. Getting sick of eating prison rations.
AID00144121	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
AID00144122	Where should I look for spare parts?
AID00144123	Ha! If we had spare parts, do you think I'd be asking you to fix the damn things? That's rich.
AID00144124	No, we ran out of spares a while back, and Jack and I have been doing our best to patch the arrays up as best we can. Sadly, we're at our wit's end.
AID00144125	There have to be spare parts somewhere around the wasteland, but I just don't know where to direct you. You may have noticed we don't get out much.
AID00144126	Funny you should mention that, I have array parts right here.
AID00144127	Hey, that's great! You shouldn't have much trouble getting those fixed up, then. Just stop back when you're done.
AID00144128	I passed through a place called Helios One. Maybe I could find parts there.
AID00144129	Are you talking about that damn bright light we've seen blast off to the south occasionally? I was wondering what the hell that was.
AID00144130	If they've got the parts, bring them on back. We need to get the array back up and charging.
AID00144131	Ringo's dead. What now?
AID00144132	Good. We'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
AID00144133	We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
AID00144134	Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
AID00144135	I've done all I can. Let's take over Goodsprings.
AID00144136	It's about time. I saw some of the townies gathering at the saloon, so we've got a militia to take down. We get rid of them and we own this place.
AID00144137	< Medicine 25 >
AID00144138	[SUCCEEDED] All right, that does sound bad. Here, take these - it should be enough. Good luck!
AID00144139	Breathing is uneven, and he's coughing up blood. Possible internal injuries.
AID00144140	[FAILED] That does sound messy, but not too bad. I can't spare supplies for cuts and bruises.
AID00144141	Well, there's lots of blood. And bruises. And maybe some other stuff, too.
AID00144142	Never mind.
AID00144143	Must not be that serious, then.
AID00144144	<Lie> I'll need all the medical supplies you can spare for an injured man down by the highway.
AID00144145	Are you sure? What kind of injuries are we talking about?
AID00144146	Has this person's condition worsened? What are the symptoms?
AID00144147	Never mind.
AID00144148	Yeah, quit it with the crazy talk.
AID00144149	< Speech 25 >
AID00144150	[SUCCEEDED] All right! I can give you some of my extra leather armor and spare ammo. Just don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
AID00144151	This is your chance to join the winning side. You have three seconds to decide. One...
AID00144152	[FAILED] Look, just leave me out of this, all right?
AID00144153	It's better if you help me out, so just do it.
AID00144154	< Barter 25 >
AID00144155	[SUCCEEDED] All right, all right. I've got some extra leather armor and spare ammo for you. Don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
AID00144156	Give up some supplies now and you won't get your store looted later.
AID00144157	[FAILED] "Maybe" doesn't do much to convince me. No, just leave me out of this, all right?
AID00144158	Maybe the Powder Gangers will reward you later.
AID00144159	The Powder Gangers need you to donate some supplies to them.
AID00144160	What? Why the hell would I want to do that?
AID00144161	This again. What makes you think I've changed my mind?
AID00144162	Way ahead of you - I killed Ringo earlier.
AID00144163	Ringo's already settled. What's next?
AID00144164	I already took care of Ringo.
AID00144165	No shit? I guess the next thing we need to do is hang out and wait for the rest of my gang to show up so we can talk about the plan.
AID00144166	VDialogueVeronicaAbeMsgRefuse
AID00144167	Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
AID00144168	VDialogueVeronicaAbeMsg4
AID00144169	Would you mind if I listened to the message you found?
AID00144170	VDialogueVeronicaAbeMsg3
AID00144171	Would you mind if I looked at the message you found?
AID00144172	VDialogueVeronicaAbeMsg2
AID00144173	Would you mind if I listened to the message?
AID00144174	VDialogueVeronicaAbeMsg1
AID00144175	Would you mind if I looked at the message?
AID00144176	Abraham wanted to say goodbye, and that he's gone North, into ghoul country.
AID00144177	Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
AID00144178	Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
AID00144179	Abe explained what happened in the Crater, how it healed him.
AID00144180	Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
AID00144181	What did you expect a ghoul to say?
AID00144182	Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
AID00144183	VDialogueVeronicaAbeSim1
AID00144184	What was on it? What did he say?
AID00144185	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorStg35
AID00144186	Sorry... feel a little out of it. Head's spinning a bit...
AID00144187	Oh. Oh!
AID00144188	I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
AID00144189	What did Abraham say to you?
AID00144190	The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
AID00144191	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorStg33
AID00144192	That was... that was hard to watch.
AID00144193	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorStg32
AID00144194	All right, I'll watch it.
AID00144195	You should watch this.
AID00144196	All right, I'll listen to it.
AID00144197	Here's the accelerator.
AID00144198	Where did you get this?
AID00144199	Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
AID00144200	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorStg21
AID00144201	Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
AID00144202	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorTrapChokept
AID00144203	And I don't like saying this, but the Mojave's safer with him... there.
AID00144204	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorChokept
AID00144205	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
AID00144206	I trapped Monte in a subway tunnel, that ghoul's not coming back.
AID00144207	Trapped him? Where?
AID00144208	I had to kill Monte for it.
AID00144209	You killed him? But...
AID00144210	I found the ghoul with the Accelerator you were looking for.
AID00144211	You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
AID00144212	But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
AID00144213	VCassLocationStrip
AID00144214	Chairmen, Omertas... a whole bunch of families rule Vegas, don't step out a line as long as money's to be made.
AID00144215	Welcome to sin. Watch where you step.
AID00144216	Watch for NCR vomit.
AID00144217	Hope you're not here to chase your losses.
AID00144218	Now to find a bar.
AID00144219	Don't understand how the missiles could have missed a target like this.
AID00144220	Beats Freeside.
AID00144221	Can't believe we got in here.
AID00144222	Dad used to say this place was what Reno tried to be. Fucking Reno.
AID00144223	Place feels like the Sorcerer of Oz sometimes.
AID00144224	Heard stories about the Lucky 38, how nobody's ever gone inside - 'cept you, that is.
AID00144225	VCassLocationFreeside
AID00144226	Hometown of the Van Graffs, don't care for this place too much.
AID00144227	We shouldn't be in here.
AID00144228	Water's scarce, but between things like this and Lake Mead, ain't too bad in the West as in other places.
AID00144229	Watch out for the Kings, they're unpredictable.
AID00144230	Kings dress like strutting girls, all fancy like.
AID00144231	Once had a King following me like I was following you - had to chase him off with a shotgun finally.
AID00144232	Kings told me I couldn't deal water here, fuckers. They like having mono. As in monopoly.
AID00144233	Ralph might be able to forge a pass into the Strip for you, you need one.
AID00144234	Looking for weapons, check out Mick and Ralphs... Mick's probably a sight better than Ralph, always trying to talk me out of my pants.
AID00144235	Kings are led by the King. Has some kind of robot dog. Guess it hunts robot rats.
AID00144236	Kings hold control over the water pump 'round here.
AID00144237	VCassLocationCampGolf
AID00144238	Not much reason to ship water here, but liquor... hard to meet demand.
AID00144239	If NCR didn't grate me so, I'd come here for water resupply.
AID00144240	Used to ship a lot of liquor here, soldiers here have too much free time.
AID00144241	If there's a reason to attack NCR, Camp Golf's a reason.
AID00144242	Watch out for the Misfits here - 9th Platoon, word of their fuck-ups is legendary.
AID00144243	Golf was a president, I think. Maybe for NCR.
AID00144244	Heard this used to be a mine field from some of the troopers here.
AID00144245	Each spot for a land mine is numbered, hear tell.
AID00144246	If you're looking for NCR's spine, ain't going to find it here.
AID00144247	Well, Hanlon sure let this place go to shit.
AID00144248	Lot of sites to this guy Golf all over the West.
AID00144249	VCassLocationBoulderCity
AID00144250	Should hit the Big Horn saloon here.
AID00144251	Heard there's still mines in the city - and maybe drunk NCR soldiers spoiling for a fight.
AID00144252	Rubble city, more like it.
AID00144253	There's a bar in the intact section, careful if you go wandering around the ruined section.
AID00144254	VCassLocationNellis
AID00144255	Folks here have access to Lake Mead, fresh drinking water.
AID00144256	Careful, Boomer territory. They ain't hostile, but they're a bit trigger happy.
AID00144257	Boomers are a might twitchy.
AID00144258	Folks here aren't friendly to anyone.
AID00144259	Don't be shooting wild in here - might set something off.
AID00144260	First time I seen a fence made out of artillery.
AID00144261	Some of these weapons look like they came from Hawthorne Army Depot, place has a lot of history.
AID00144262	Can hear the screaming of rockets and explosions in this place at night.
AID00144263	Got nests for planes here.
AID00144264	An assault on this place would be suicide.
AID00144265	VCassLocationFiends
AID00144266	Shit. Fiends.
AID00144267	Smells like Fiends.
AID00144268	Can smell the chem labs and Jet from here.
AID00144269	Make sure you have a backup weapon, Fiends don't go down easy.
AID00144270	Watch for dogs.
AID00144271	Heard tell there was a Vault somewhere around here.
AID00144272	VCassLocationNovac
AID00144273	This place reminds me the Old World had too much time on its hands.
AID00144274	Named this place after the hotel.
AID00144275	NoVac's the hotel, not the lizard.
AID00144276	Smells like junk.
AID00144277	Can see Dinky for miles, good landmark.
AID00144278	First saw this place, thought the giant gecko was real.
AID00144279	Read a book that giant lizards walked the earth like this one - might be a gecko this size.
AID00144280	VCassLocationPrimm
AID00144281	Said there's a courier office here?
AID00144282	Sign of the buffalo.
AID00144283	Ah, Bison Steve, you old shithole.
AID00144284	Those post office boxes in these old towns still work.
AID00144285	Good contact, Nash, used to be here. Had a son that went West.
AID00144286	Old World had cars that ran on roads like these above the ground, 'cept they didn't go anywhere.
AID00144287	The sheriff here ain't worth a damn.
AID00144288	Crazy ass shit.
AID00144289	VCassLocationNCRCF
AID00144290	Looks like prisoners are in charge now.
AID00144291	No guards in the towers, not a good sign.
AID00144292	Guess NCR fucked this place, too.
AID00144293	VCassLocationRangerStation
AID00144294	Rest stop.
AID00144295	NCR's friendly, might be able to resupply.
AID00144296	A little safe ground.
AID00144297	NCR flag - not safe, close to it, though.
AID00144298	I changed my mind - I'll help you with your mercenary problem.
AID00144299	Thanks.
AID00144300	Let's talk about something else.
AID00144301	That's a great idea.
AID00144302	How did they end up here?
AID00144303	Well, they unloaded what they had left on the Dino Bite as a tax write-off. But that was before my time.
AID00144304	Plenty of demand for them, seeing as they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
AID00144305	CliffBriscoeBarterFail
AID00144306	[FAILED] Are you kidding me? I can't ship these things fast enough. People love them!
AID00144307	But... the price tag seems so excessive on the souvenir rockets. Could you make it lower?
AID00144308	Tell me about the Rangers.
AID00144309	They're the NCR's finest. A one-man platoon, each of 'em.
AID00144310	You got a job where even thinking about it would scare a man senseless, that's when you bring in the Rangers.
AID00144311	And if you see a squad of the veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
AID00144312	RangerAndyStationCompletion
AID00144313	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
AID00144314	Here. Take this, courtesy of the Ranger veterans fund.
AID00144315	Tell you what. I'll pay you for what you did, but I'll do you one better, too.
AID00144316	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
AID00144317	Let me show you how it's done.
AID00144318	What did you do?
AID00144319	I go to grab him out of there and I notice he's holding something in his hand. Something metal.
AID00144320	He shuts himself back inside the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
AID00144321	They do it a lot, the Legion. Using kids. They know we'll hesitate.
AID00144322	Anyway, that was the first time. Second time I fell down those stairs in front of the motel. Just in case I got to thinking I'd put it all behind me.
AID00144323	Hey, just because you're idle and you'll never walk again... I forgot where I was going with that.
AID00144324	I'm sure it was very inspiring.
AID00144325	<Lie> I think the attackers were dead too... so it's... hard to tell.
AID00144326	In Ranger school, they teach you how to spot a liar. I don't know why you're lying, but have it your way. We'll protect this town or die trying.
AID00144327	Cowboy robot? You mean Primm Slim?
AID00144328	Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
AID00144329	Cowboy robot? You mean the one over there?
AID00144330	Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
AID00144331	One of those men shot me. I need to know the best way to get to them.
AID00144332	Well for that your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
AID00144333	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
AID00144334	He may have heard where they were going.
AID00144335	Deputy Beagle would have been your best bet, before he met that tragic end.
AID00144336	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
AID00144337	Maybe you can track down whatever notes he was keeping and find some thing to help you there.
AID00144338	So what's next for you guys?
AID00144339	I figure we'll hang around Goodsprings for awhile, maybe get some of the other gangs to join up with us.
AID00144340	Won't kill anybody else unless we have to. Just as long as people do what we tell them, they'll be all right.
AID00144341	It's easy pickings. Why, you got somewhere else to be?
AID00144342	Yeah, I guess me and the guys could push this place over pretty easily.
AID00144343	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
AID00144344	Here - the spare medical supplies from Doc Mitchell.
AID00144345	All right! We got all sorts of shit in here. Nice job. Better take some for yourself in case you get hit.
AID00144346	What is this place?
AID00144347	All right, here's your money.
AID00144348	Here's your money.
AID00144349	On second thought, I'll be fine.

AID00144359	You think that did it? Maybe we should test the rangefinder outside.
AID00144360	What happened then?
AID00144361	That wicked old Master got what was coming to him, that's what! After his cathedral blew up, I decided it was high time to go home.
AID00144362	Who was the Master?
AID00144363	Oh, he was a nasty man, dearie. You don't want to know about him. He was the one who made that Super mutant army I told you about.
AID00144364	You were a soldier?
AID00144365	A spy. Sometimes an assassin. I killed a lot of folks for the Master. Yes, Leo, you helped, too.
AID00144366	Where did you come from?
AID00144367	I grew up in Vault 17. I never even saw the sun until I was 75 years old - that was when Super mutants raided the Vault and carried a lot of us off.
AID00144368	Yes, Leo, I'm getting to that part! They made me one of them, and they put me to work in an army that was going to conquer California.
AID00144369	Never mind, I had some other questions.
AID00144370	What do you need, sugar?
AID00144371	What's the best way for me to use your skills?

AID00144383	Hush, Leo, it's medicine time now!
AID00144384	Lily, I'd like to talk to you about your medication.
AID00144385	Oh, don't you worry your silly little head about that, pumpkin. Grandma knows what she's doing.
AID00144386	I have some questions to ask you.
AID00144387	Such a curious little munchkin, aren't you? What do you want to know?
AID00144388	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00144389	Of course, Jimmy.
AID00144390	I think you have me confused with someone else.

AID00144438	Should have heard stories of the Khans years ago - they were one tough bunch, now...
AID00144439	Khans lost their strength after Bitter Springs, came here to lick their wounds.
AID00144440	Let's not split up here, all right?
AID00144441	Don't take any chems here - hell knows what they're laced with.
AID00144442	Won't trade with Khans - they've poisoned most of the villages west of Vegas with chems.
AID00144443	Fiends would suffer withdrawal and die without the Khans.
AID00144444	Place would be beautiful... without the chem addicts and dealers.

AID00144551	What kind of medicine are you taking?
AID00144552	Doctor Henry calls them "anti-psychotics." I don't know what they're supposed to do, they just make my memory fuzzy.

AID00144554	Leo is a very bad man, pumpkin! Yes you are, Leo, don't try to deny it!

AID00144573	Let's talk about something else.
AID00144574	All right. What's on your mind?
AID00144575	I'll be back. I've got work to do.
AID00144576	Be sure to stop on back and let me know when the arrays are fixed.
AID00144577	What was I supposed to do again?
AID00144578	Just head over to the REPCONN test site west of here. See if you can get the ghouls out of there.
AID00144579	Now about the man I'm looking for...
AID00144580	Okay, I'll tell you everything I know, like I promised.
AID00144581	VMQ01MannyVargasAnswer
AID00144582	The guy you're looking for, Benny, he was traveling with some members from my old gang. They were going to Boulder City.
AID00144583	Actually, I already took care of it.
AID00144584	The ghouls are no longer at REPCONN.
AID00144585	Really? Unbelievable, man! I knew that wasn't gonna be easy.
AID00144586	But I had a good feeling about you. You look like you been through a lot.
AID00144587	Okay, I'll see what can be done about it.
AID00144588	It'd mean a lot to me.
AID00144589	What needs to be done?
AID00144590	Well they gotta go, or this'll be a ghost town before long.
AID00144591	Doesn't matter to me what you do. As long as the ghouls are out of there, that's good enough for me.
AID00144592	Why don't you deal with it?
AID00144593	I would. But I've gotta watch the road. Caesar's Legion has been taking territory just east of here. They took Nelson.
AID00144594	If we let our guard down, they might attack. All it takes for the Legion is for them to sense weakness.
AID00144595	I can't. I'm in a hurry.
AID00144596	Say no more. I hope things work out for you.
AID00144597	Sure. Maybe I can help ease your mind.
AID00144598	See? I was right about you.
AID00144599	That's all I needed to know.
AID00144600	Glad I could help.
AID00144601	Hey, I know you got no reason to help me now, but you seem really nice. Could I at least tell you about the problem we've got here?
AID00144602	Hope that helps. I owed you.
AID00144603	Where is Boulder City?
AID00144604	It's straight up Route 93 from here. Just keep following the road north.
AID00144605	Any idea why they went that way?
AID00144606	No clue. I know Benny hadn't paid up yet. Maybe that was where they were supposed to get square.
AID00144607	You've had your needs neglected for far too long, haven't you? I can tell.
AID00144608	Yeah, I... everybody depends on you, you know? But they don't ask you about how you feel. What you worry about.
AID00144609	There's something I like about you. You just seem really understanding. I was gonna ask you for a favor, but I'll just tell you what you wanna know.
AID00144610	What do you need?
AID00144611	Novac, it's home for me now. I want that to be for good. I like it here, and I've left too many homes behind.
AID00144612	But the only resource we got here is junk. Without that, people wouldn't have anything to trade. They'd all have to leave.
AID00144613	We get most of it up the road from the old rocket test site. But a bunch of ghouls showed up one day and took it over. We can't get in there now.
AID00144614	Forget it. I'll find him on my own.
AID00144615	Hey, do what you want. I'm just trying to make it easier on you.
AID00144616	<Lie> He's a good friend of mine. I'm trying to help him out.
AID00144617	Oh yeah? A good friend? If you say so, man.
AID00144618	Whatever he's doing, I want in on it.
AID00144619	A piece of the action, huh? I don't think he's the sharing type, but okay.
AID00144620	None of your business.
AID00144621	Hey, doesn't matter to me. I was just curious.
AID00144622	I'm looking for answers.
AID00144623	Must be something pretty important to be chasing a guy like that.
AID00144624	He has something of mine.
AID00144625	You talking about that chip? Man, I don't think he's giving it up.
AID00144626	I have a score to settle.
AID00144627	Doesn't surprise me. Guy seemed like he'd do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Probably makes a lot of enemies.
AID00144628	Well listen, I can definitely help you find him, but I've got problems of my own.
AID00144629	Maybe we can do a trade. You need my help. There's something I need, too.

AID00144647	Yeah, got this look when he saw you next down on the Courier list. His expression turned right around, asked me if your name was for real.
AID00144648	I said, sure as lack of rain, you were still kicking. Then he turned down the job, just like that. I asked if he was sure, it was good money.
AID00144649	No, let "Courier Six" carry the package, that's what he said - like the Mojave'd sort you out or something. Then he just up and walked out.
AID00144650	He canceled?
AID00144651	I have better things to do.
AID00144652	Then that is your choice. If you should change your mind, please return.
AID00144653	I'll help you.
AID00144654	
AID00144655	Then allow me to explain our situation. This bunker is currently locked down, allowing no entry or exit, with you being one of the few exceptions.
AID00144656	In exceptional cases, teams are sent out to investigate sites or retrieve materials deemed too important to ignore.
AID00144657	Three such teams have gone missing recently, and the news of their disappearance has not yet been widely spread to avoid undue concern.
AID00144658	In order to maintain the peace, and adhere to the strictures of the lockdown, I need to send someone else to discover what happened to them.
AID00144659	Not all of them.
AID00144660	Keep looking for them. The information they have is vital.
AID00144661	I already found all three patrols. They were all dead.
AID00144662	I suppose I am not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
AID00144663	I already found a couple of your patrols. The paladins were all dead.
AID00144664	T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
AID00144665	I think I already found one of your patrols. Both Paladins were dead.
AID00144666	While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
AID00144667	I want no part of this.
AID00144668	I half expected you to say that. In which case, I'll continue to pursue the matter on my own.
AID00144669	Should you continue dealing with the Elder and find yourself beginning to see my point of view, I'll be around.
AID00144670	How do you propose to do that?
AID00144671	I don't know. I've gone through our records dozens of times looking for a precedent regarding the dismissal of an Elder and come up with nothing.
AID00144672	The people who are most likely to know how it could be done are also some of McNamara's strongest supporters, so they refuse to help me.
AID00144673	Which is why we're having this conversation. An outsider such as yourself would arouse less suspicion asking questions about such matters.
AID00144674	The fact that the Elder has some tasks for you means his faithful won't suspect you, and you have a line open to the man himself.
AID00144675	In short, you're in a perfect position to help me. Will you at least think about it?
AID00144676	I don't have ti-
AID00144677	Tell me about the Scribes.
AID00144678	The Scribes are responsible for discovering how all the old tech we recover actually works and sometimes even work on inventing new things.
AID00144679	Without them, the Brotherhood could never fulfill its mission. Or at least, that's what my dad always used to say.
AID00144680	Tell me about the Knights.
AID00144681	Knights are in charge of all of our equipment. Power armor, gatling lasers, you name it. All of it built and maintained by Knights.
AID00144682	Knights also get to go out on patrols, scouting assignments, and support the Paladins in offensive operations.
AID00144683	Being a Knight would mean getting to see more of the world, fight the Brotherhood's enemies, and possibly someday become a Paladin like my mother.
AID00144684	Let's talk about something else.
AID00144685	Okay.
AID00144686	What do you mean decide for yourself?
AID00144687	I'm currently an Apprentice in the Brotherhood, and recently became eligible for Journeyman status.
AID00144688	But first, I have to decide which Order I want to join - the Knights or the Scribes.
AID00144689	Initiate Stanton told me about your little adventure the other day.
AID00144690	That was so much fun! The wind whipping through our hair, not knowing what was going to jump out at us at any moment.
AID00144691	And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line then up and squeeze the trigger.
AID00144692	I doubt I'll be able to get Stanton to go with me again, though. I thought he'd enjoy it as much as I did, but he was just scared the whole time.
AID00144693	Don't tell him I told you this, but when those scorpions surrounded us, I'd bet a week's rations he pissed himself!
AID00144694	So who do you take after more? Your mother or your father?
AID00144695	I don't know, I'm a little like both of them I guess. If I had to choose, I really don't know which I'd pick.
AID00144696	That's a question I've been asked a lot lately, since it's something I have to decide for myself soon.
AID00144697	Are you parents here somewhere?
AID00144698	They both died at HELIOS One. The others were always like a family to me before that, but afterward they became my family in truth.
AID00144699	Tell me about yourself.
AID00144700	Well, like just about everyone else here, I grew up in the Brotherhood. My father was a Scribe and my mother a Paladin.
AID00144701	You said "anymore" before. Did the Brotherhood used to go out more?
AID00144702	Yeah, a lot more. Back when we were at the HELIOS station. Er, crap.
AID00144703	I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about that, especially with outsiders, so forget you just heard that, okay?
AID00144704	Shouldn't you be in school or something?
AID00144705	Head Scribe Taggart quickly realized my extraordinary talent when I took the mandatory VR combat testing.
AID00144706	Soon after that, he requested that I get transferred to VR specialist training, serving as his assistant.
AID00144707	I miss hanging out with the other students all the time, but at least I get to skip all those boring lectures.
AID00144708	What's with all the computers?
AID00144709	It's our virtual reality training hall. We don't really go out all that often anymore, so this is how we stay sharp.
AID00144710	No, it's nothing.
AID00144711	I do that all the time myself. One moment I'll think I've solved the conundrum, and the next I'm back to square one. Don't let it bother you.
AID00144712	Was there something else you wanted?
AID00144713	About the virus...
AID00144714	Yes, did you have an idea that might help us?
AID00144715	What kind of information is in the datastore?
AID00144716	Oh, all kinds of things! There was already information regarding the layout and systems of this bunker, but we've since added our own data as well.
AID00144717	Prior to the lockdown, we had extensively scouted the surrounding area, and compiled dossiers on nearby points of interest.
AID00144718	Anything I can help you with?
AID00144719	If you must know, my inventory check this week shows that our weapon count is one short. Somehow we're missing a laser pistol.
AID00144720	Hardin will have my head if I don't find that weapon soon. I can't delay my report to him any longer.
AID00144721	McNamara gave me permission to use the store, so start selling.
AID00144722	I could look around for the pistol.
AID00144723	If you happen to find it, bring it here right away. I might be able to throw a few supplies your way if you do.
AID00144724	Show me what you have for sale.
AID00144725	Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
AID00144726	Not right now. I want to ask you a few questions.
AID00144727	I suppose I could take a small break, but I can only spare a little time. Ask away.
AID00144728	So you'd vote against McNamara if Hardin called a tribunal?
AID00144729	
AID00144730	I don't have time to think about silly things like politics right now. My main concern right now is getting this blasted datastore up and running.
AID00144731	What do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
AID00144732	I can understand how the man might be frustrated by the current situation. He's a take-charge sort of fellow. Standing around's not his strong suit.
AID00144733	I myself often wish we could end this interminable stasis and begin moving forward again.
AID00144734	Now that the datastore is fixed, what do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
AID00144735	I changed my mind. I'll keep your little secret.
AID00144736	Vote for Hardin when he calls a tribunal.
AID00144737	Fine, but you're making a big mistake. Hardin isn't half the leader that McNamara is.
AID00144738	Don't worry, I'll keep your little secret.
AID00144739	Thank you. There's no telling what would happen if everyone were to suddenly find out, but I trust it wouldn't be good.
AID00144740	The rest of the chapter should be told!
AID00144741	No! Please don't! Everyone would blame me! Look, I'll do whatever you want, just name it!
AID00144742	So you and the McNamara both know about this?
AID00144743	...Yes. When I first discovered how much the systems had deteriorated, I reported it to the Elder right away.
AID00144744	He told me he'd take action right away, and sent out several patrols to search for parts.
AID00144745	Your terminal had some very interesting things to say about the state of the air filtration system.
AID00144746	What were you doing looking at my terminal? No, never mind that. You can't tell anyone about what you found!
AID00144747	There'd be widespread panic. The Elder has the situation under control.
AID00144748	So you won't vote for Hardin?
AID00144749	Who is Elijah?
AID00144750	Who was Elijah, more like. He was our Elder before McNamara. Bright guy, but just between you and me he was a little off.
AID00144751	Our mission is to recover and preserve the technology of the past, but Elijah wanted more. He sought ways to improve upon technology, make it better.
AID00144752	When we found HELIOS One, he was like a kid in a candy store. He kept talking about the potential, and a "grand design, never realized."
AID00144753	He even insisted we set up our base there, against the objection of nearly every paladin. What followed is a whole other story.
AID00144754	What happened with Elijah?
AID00144755	I've discovered proof that the chapter is in danger, and McNamara has covered it up.
AID00144756	So you won't support Hardin if he calls a tribunal?
AID00144757	Can you tell me about some of the other people here?
AID00144758	Tell me about what happened at HELIOS.
AID00144759	I'm sure someone's told you all this before. Several years back, we were running our chapter out the HELIOS One solar power station.
AID00144760	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, had some kind of obsession with the place. Which is the only reason we stayed as long as we did.
AID00144761	That place was hardly defensible, and we knew the NCR was moving in on us, but the Elder refused to budge, insisting that he just needed "more time".
AID00144762	We never found out what he needed the time for. Wave upon wave of NCR troopers hit us from all directions.
AID00144763	We held out for a time, but we were grossly outnumbered, and they had more men than we had ammo. Eventually our positions collapsed.
AID00144764	Elder Elijah was nowhere to be found, so McNamara took charge and led what remained of us on a counter-offensive west.
AID00144765	We lost a lot of men and women, but we broke through and made it here. Make no mistake, McNamara saved this chapter that day.
AID00144766	What would an Elder have to do to get kicked out?
AID00144767	So you've been talking to Hardin, eh? He's been looking for a way to usurp McNamara ever since the lockdown started.
AID00144768	Don't get me wrong, he's a good man, but Elder McNamara's done all right by us. If it weren't for him, none of us would have survived at HELIOS.
AID00144769	I'll tell you what I told Hardin. There have only been a few cases of Elders being dismissed from their posts in the Brotherhood's history.
AID00144770	And those involved crimes that someone like Elder McNamara is just not capable of. You can look it up for yourself, if you want.
AID00144771	I'll grant you access to that portion of the history section of our datastore. See Senior Scribe Ibsen about accessing it.
AID00144772	I had other questions.
AID00144773	Fine by me.
AID00144774	What exactly are the rules regarding entering and leaving?
AID00144775	Under the lockdown, only essential personnel are permitted to enter or leave. That includes supply runners and high security patrols.
AID00144776	All other personnel are forbidden to leave, and any personnel that were out there when the lockdown was enacted are forbidden from returning.
AID00144777	Did you know Watkins and Stanton snuck out of here a few weeks ago?
AID00144778	Yeah, I knew about it. They're still young, and they weren't going to go very far.
AID00144779	I had them on my monitors the whole time. I almost headed out there when they got surrounded by those scorpions, but Watkins is a hell of a shot.
AID00144780	So why did I have to deal with that Ranger topside?
AID00144781	Normally, that would have fallen under my jurisdiction, but the Elder thought it'd provide a good test for you, so I backed off.
AID00144782	So you're head of security?
AID00144783	That's right. Nothing gets in or out of here without me knowing it.
AID00144784	You really don't like Taggart, do you?
AID00144785	I don't appreciate how much harder I have to work to cover for his tendency to focus on his personal projects.
AID00144786	I try not to think too much about his personal proclivities.
AID00144787	Was Initiate Watkins the "pet" you were referring to earlier?
AID00144788	She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions toward her aren't quite so innocent.
AID00144789	Why not tell on him?
AID00144790	Oh, I tried. The elder listened patiently to my carefully constructed argument regarding why that buffoon should lose his position.
AID00144791	Then he just as patiently explained to me that Taggart's work was vital to our cause, and that he wasn't to be trifled with "lesser matters."
AID00144792	But vital to our cause? Hardly.
AID00144793	Let's talk about something else.
AID00144794	If you wish.
AID00144795	You mentioned other duties you had?
AID00144796	I'm this bunker's Head Scribe in everything but name. I supervise the research teams. I collate the reports. I attend the meetings.
AID00144797	But for reasons beyond me, that buffoon Taggart still gets the title. And don't get me started on that little pet of his.
AID00144798	Everyone around here knows what's going on there but her.
AID00144799	What services can you perform?
AID00144800	We have equipment here to treat most physical injuries - lacerations, broken bones, that sort of thing. We also carry a full supply of antitoxins.
AID00144801	You may have noticed the Bark Scorpions up above. Though tiny, their venom packs quite a punch. Treating scorpion stings is my most common procedure.
AID00144802	I can also treat any form of radiation sickness you pick up out in the waste, no matter what stage, save the last.
AID00144803	So you're a doctor?
AID00144804	Yes, I handle all medical needs in the bunker. If you're ever wounded, I can treat you, for a fee.
AID00144805	Normally I'd just be the base's medical officer, but my other duties say otherwise.
AID00144806	Explain to me again what you're trying to do.
AID00144807	HVHardinInitialLine
AID00144808	Nolan, we'll resume this discussion later. I can see you have company.
AID00144809	What can you tell me about the other members of the Brotherhood here?
AID00144810	I refuse.
AID00144811	I'll see what I can do.
AID00144812	Have you tried bringing this up with the Elder yourself?
AID00144813	Of course I have. Many times, in fact. The Elder has an open door policy, and will listen to advice on any subject, save this one.
AID00144814	He refuses to see that our isolation is slowly weakening us. Aside from being our duty, going out on missions is what kept us strong.
AID00144815	And because he fails to see that, he must be replaced.
AID00144816	What about Veronica? She seems to come and go as she pleases.
AID00144817	Veronica's a special case. She handles the procurement of supplies. If we didn't let her and those like her back in, we'd all starve.
AID00144818	If the Elder could manage it, he'd shut them out as well, and all in the name of security. Which is why we need to replace him.
AID00144819	Why should I trust you?
AID00144820	Why should you trust the Elder? I'd recommend listening to both of us, and choosing whom to trust for yourself.
AID00144821	So are you willing to listen?
AID00144822	No, I won't listen to you.
AID00144823	If you change your mind, though, come find me, and we'll talk more.
AID00144824	Sure, go ahead.
AID00144825	As you may have already heard, this entire base is under a state of lockdown. No one goes out except small patrols at night.
AID00144826	Most of the chapter has been sealed in here for years, and those few who were outside when the lockdown was initiated are forbidden from returning.
AID00144827	Morale has plummeted as time has gone by, and many of our current paladins haven't even seen combat outside of training simulations.
AID00144828	And all because of the Elder's explicit order that no one be allowed in or out. The only way things will change is if a new Elder is installed.
AID00144829	You've got trouble. The NCR are planning a raid on this place soon.
AID00144830	Sounds like they're already here. There's no way I'm letting them take me alive.
AID00144831	There's no reason for you to stick around and help us, but feel free to kill a few of the bastards on your way out.
AID00144832	Why do you think the NCR and the Legion both want the Dam?
AID00144833	I'm pretty sure the NCR wants to hold onto the Dam because it's one of the few places around that can make electricity.
AID00144834	The Legion are a bunch of savages, though. No idea why they'd want the Dam. Probably plan on destroying it or something.
AID00144835	What can you tell me about the Legion?
AID00144836	Slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble. They dress up like Roman soldiers, so there's no mistaking it when you see them.
AID00144837	The rumor is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
AID00144838	Tell me about the NCR.
AID00144839	The New California Republic's got the most power in Nevada. Money, troops, you name it.
AID00144840	They do what they can to keep things safe in the region, but if you ask me, they're trying to do too much. They're spread too thin.
AID00144841	Anything interesting going on in the rest of the wasteland?
AID00144842	There's always something interesting going on, but the biggest news has to be the coming dustup between the NCR and the Legion over the Dam.
AID00144843	Goodbye.
AID00144844	Three days.
AID00144845	No, we finish this now.
AID00144846	Crap, you don't even want to live a few more days? Go. Get laid one more time or something - we're walking away. Three days.
AID00144847	Please, just leave me alone
AID00144848	Just leave me alone.
AID00144849	You're asking for leniency from us? Are you crazy?! We show up when the talking's over, get it?
AID00144850	What can I do about that?
AID00144851	You've got three days to improve your reputation with the NCR or we come for you... without all of this pleasant conversation.
AID00144852	Have a nice day now, you hear?
AID00144853	So what?! Screw you and screw the NCR!
AID00144854	What did I do to the NCR?
AID00144855	You got yourself a bad reputation with us - that's what.
AID00144856	Can you make me some of your Moonshine?
AID00144857	Don't have all the ingredients you need - come back when you have 'em, and I'd be happy to get something cooking.
AID00144858	Here's the items for making some Moonshine.
AID00144859	Look, no guarantee on the quality, only the results. And don't drink too much of this stuff or you might go blind.
AID00144860	All right, I'll start brewing.
AID00144861	Here you go. Go easy on it until you train yourself to choke back the urge to gag. After a few bottles and the vomiting, it ain't so bad.
AID00144862	Wait, you can make Moonshine?
AID00144863	Yeah, what else you going to do with an empty bottle? Wait for it to refill itself?
AID00144864	Get me some ingredients out of the Mojave, an empty bottle, a little time, and I'll keep us stocked.
AID00144865	Where do you usually go to drink?
AID00144866	There's usually a bar in every stop along the road. Helps me sleep. Well, not really, but I tell myself that.
AID00144867	Sometimes I have to brew it myself if I'm too far from a bar. Not quality, but I'm for anything that takes the edge off the day.
AID00144868	VMQTopsYesManElDorado
AID00144869	Hi there! Come with me!
AID00144870	Just to the top of the ridge up here...
AID00144871	See that? Vegas, right? Same as always - but not tonight!
AID00144872	5... 4... 3... 2... 1!
AID00144873	Pretty nice, huh? But that's not all!
AID00144874	Now that the Lucky 38's reactor is fired up, Vegas doesn't need the dam to have power! Vegas is energy-independent! Whoo-hoo!
AID00144875	If we keep the dam running, we can sell all its electricity to the NCR for a nice profit. Vegas doesn't need it!
AID00144876	Hope to see you soon!
AID00144877	So I get to kill you over and over again. <Attack Yes Man.>
AID00144878	Hahaha! I knew there was a positive in it somewhere!
AID00144879	You set me up. Now you die.
AID00144880	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
AID00144881	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
AID00144882	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
AID00144883	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
AID00144884	I'm serious.
AID00144885	Hahaha! That's not funny, you getting shot in the head.
AID00144886	I really shouldn't have taken so much pride in how I set that up, huh? I feel really bad right now.
AID00144887	I'm the courier Benny shot.
AID00144888	Hahaha! I know that's not true, because you still have a head!
AID00144889	What do you know about the courier Benny shot?
AID00144890	I knew he was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for him!
AID00144891	I knew she was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for her!
AID00144892	That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter!
AID00144893	Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip- just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't!
AID00144894	Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them?
AID00144895	I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?
AID00144896	I'm ready. You'd better be, too.
AID00144897	< Science 25 >
AID00144898	[SUCCEEDED] All right, but put everything back the way you found it!
AID00144899	There may be data corruption in one of your memory chips. Let me take a look.
AID00144900	[FAILED] No offense, pardner, but I'd rather not have you rooting around in there. It's technical-like.
AID00144901	Maybe something's broken in one of your computer parts. Let me take a look.
AID00144902	EDERadioConversation4
AID00144903	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I've heard through various channels that you have some... curious robot with you.
AID00144904	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, we'd love to have the opportunity to examine the technology on that machine.
AID00144905	We'll make sure whatever information we find is used for the greater good - and who knows, I may be able to give it some kind of upgrade for you.
AID00144906	EDERadioConversation3
AID00144907	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I monitored a communication earlier between you and someone with the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00144908	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
AID00144909	Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
AID00144910	EDERadioConversation
AID00144911	Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
AID00144912	I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
AID00144913	This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
AID00144914	Could you bring your robot to one of our patrols so they can examine it? I'll have the robot mark the location on your map.
AID00144915	Do you know anything about Hoover Dam?
AID00144916	Never been there since the NCR's got troops all over it. Must be pretty important.
AID00144917	I could use another gun at my side.
AID00144918	That's a mighty fine offer, but I'm gonna need to conserve my strength if I抦 to make it all the way to New Vegas.
AID00144919	I'm sure you'll do just fine without old Vic slowing you down.
AID00144920	I could use a bed and some supplies
AID00144921	Well, this ain't New Vegas, but I reckon you can find what you need here. Try the office out front.
AID00144922	This is too big to be a coincidence, robot - what's your angle?
AID00144923	Now don't go getting paranoid, pardner - that bullet to your brain-pan probably just bucked your Brahmin a little. We're all friends here.
AID00144924	Quite a coincidence us meeting like this.
AID00144925	Seeing how this is the only road around, I'd be a sight more surprised if we didn't run into each other from time to time.
AID00144926	So what's the story with this place?
AID00144927	Novac? Nice enough place I suppose... but between you and me - when I rolled into town my skin started to itch. Watch yourself.
AID00144928	Goodbye
AID00144929	Be seeing you.
AID00144930	Just stay out of my way, robot.
AID00144931	I'll let that slide seeing how you gotta mind full of vengeance for that no-good polecat and all.
AID00144932	You said the men that jumped me were heading this way, right?
AID00144933	No, don't believe I did, but you might ask around - the Novac folk usually see anyone traveling this way.
AID00144934	It's nice to see a friendly face out here.
AID00144935	Likewise, friend - likewise. Is there anything old Vic can do you for?
AID00144936	What are you doing in Novac?
AID00144937	Don't rightly know - I just got the notion to make my way to New Vegas. Reckon I'll find out when I get there.
AID00144938	VDiaTheStripSS4MPBFuckThis
AID00144939	Hey... Hey! Where the hell are you going?Well, fuck you, then!
AID00144940	VDiaTheStripSS4MPAFuckThis
AID00144941	You know what? It's all yours, then. Fuck this shit! I'm done.
AID00144942	VDiaTheStripSS4MPBCurse02
AID00144943	Hey, talk to Pappas if you've got complaints. I'm just want to be done with this shit.
AID00144944	VDiaTheStripSS4MPBCurse01
AID00144945	Shut up, and get to it. You rather be elsewhere? I can arrange a trip to the sewers - you'll love the smell.
AID00144946	VDiaTheStripSS4MPACurse02
AID00144947	I can deal with them dancing in the fountain, I can deal with them running a Brahmin down The Strip.
AID00144948	Hell, I can even deal with the puke in the latrines. But I can't stand the smell of turpentine, fuck that!
AID00144949	VDiaTheStripSS4MPACurse01
AID00144950	This shit is not going to come off, I'm telling you.
AID00144951	[Attack] You just crossed the line.
AID00144952	[Attack] You just crossed the line.
AID00144953	Fine, take 400.
AID00144954	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
AID00144955	[Attack] I'll give you something nice to talk about.
AID00144956	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
AID00144957	[Attack] You've just screwed up, big time.
AID00144958	Think you can get away with this? Guys, time to rough this one up!
AID00144959	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
AID00144960	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
AID00144961	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
AID00144962	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
AID00144963	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
AID00144964	You cheap bastard, like all Mojave people. I'd beat you senseless right now, if we didn't have more important things to do.
AID00144965	But this is not over, get it? We'll see each other again, when you least expect it.
AID00144966	I don't have 200 caps.
AID00144967	What have I done?
AID00144968	Let's just say that people around here talk about you. They say things, not nice things. We only like to hear nice things, get it?
AID00144969	Thank you, I'm ready for it too.
AID00144970	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
AID00144971	Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
AID00144972	The pleasure's for both of us. Pass by later, I'll let you in.
AID00144973	Let me ask you about something else.
AID00144974	I've also got something for you. Pass by my room later.
AID00144975	What's article 49?
AID00144976	What do I get out of helping you?
AID00144977	If I become Elder, the lockdown will be lifted, and we'll once again be able to send patrols out into the wastes. We'll become powerful again.
AID00144978	And when that happens, it will be good to have the Brotherhood as an ally. Good enough?
AID00144979	I'll see what I can do.
AID00144980	That'll have to do. I'd recommend going to see Ramos first. As head of security, he's more familiar with our protocols than anyone else here.
AID00144981	You could also try to find something relevant in our datastore, though last I heard, Scribe Ibsen has having a bit of a problem accessing it.
AID00144982	And if McNamara should give you any tasks, I'd ask that you kept me abreast of them.
AID00144983	Report anything you find to me, and we'll move from there.
AID00144984	And I suppose you'd nominate yourself?
AID00144985	I would. I'm the senior-most paladin in the Chapter, and have more combat experience than any two others here put together.
AID00144986	I'd gladly support another candidate, but no one has the courage to step forward and make the attempt, so it falls to me.
AID00144987	I would put this chapter back on the right path, if I could just assume leadership.
AID00144988	I wanted to ask you a few questions.
AID00144989	No, I had some questions for you.
AID00144990	Guess I'll be going then.
AID00144991	Do that. And take care to avoid the valley to the east, if you know what's good for you.
AID00144992	What are you doing here?
AID00144993	I've no reason to disclose the purpose of my actions to a stranger. Please leave.
AID00144994	Elder McNamara sent me for your report. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
AID00144995	Then I am sworn to report. I've been dividing my time between the camps to the north and south of here.
AID00144996	One belongs to the NCR, the other to a band of slavers known as Caesar's Legion. I was sure the NCR would quickly win, but that has not happened.
AID00144997	Instead, the two sides have reached a stalemate, and only occasionally send skirmishers against one another.
AID00144998	If I didn't know better, I'd say neither side is confident enough to push for a full victory. Which seems strange given the NCR's technological edge.
AID00144999	In any event, I've recorded my findings in this report. Please deliver it to the Elder. I am sure he will find the contents most interesting.
AID00145000	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and only after an extended duration did the NCR finally destroy its opponent.
AID00145001	When they did, it appeared they did so with the help of fresh reinforcements. I do not believe they could have managed the feat without them.
AID00145002	That savages such as these could last so long against the NCR is troubling. Please, take my findings to the Elder. He'll know what to make of this.
AID00145003	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after an extended time the slavers rose up and slaughtered the NCR to the man.
AID00145004	That barbarians with such crude weapons could crush a foe that defeated us is food for much thought.
AID00145005	Here, take my report to the Elder. He must be made aware of what happened here.
AID00145006	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after some time fighting broke out and both sides were mysteriously wiped out.
AID00145007	Things were rather chaotic, so I wasn't able to see exactly what happened, or who did the deed, but seeing the NCR suffer such a loss was a shock.
AID00145008	The Elder must know of what happened here. Take this report to him. It contains my notes on these events. Maybe he'll make some sense of it all.
AID00145009	Don't mind me. Just passing through.
AID00145010	If so, you may wish to go around that town to the south. It's been taken by slavers, and they seem to be waiting for something, or someone.
AID00145011	What are you doing way up here?
AID00145012	That's none of your business. I suggest you head back the way you came.
AID00145013	Elder McNamara sent me as his representative. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
AID00145014	Strange that the Elder should send an outsider, but I suppose he has his reasons.
AID00145015	My observations have mostly focused on the small town to the south of here. It was cruelly attacked, its inhabitants slain nearly to the last.
AID00145016	That such an act could occur so far west is nearly unthinkable. The NCR has forces in all directions, and an outpost scant miles west from here.
AID00145017	That they have not responded to this violence shows either an unwillingness or inability to properly defend their borders, which is telling.
AID00145018	I've collected such musings in this report. Please take it to the Elder.
AID00145019	Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. I'll just be going.
AID00145020	See that you do. I'd advise you to avoid the prison over there. It's overrun by barbarians and the whole place may become a battlefield at any time.
AID00145021	I'm just wondering what you're doing here.
AID00145022	My purpose here is none of your concern. Now leave me be or I'll be forced to defend myself.
AID00145023	He said to tell you that the Chain That Binds bids you to speak.
AID00145024	I'm Elder McNamara's representative. He said to ask if the bears are still hunting.
AID00145025	You speak truly, for it is unlikely that an outsider would know both the Elder's name and that passphrase.
AID00145026	Very well. I've been observing the penal facility there in the distance for some time now, after having followed some rather disturbing rumors.
AID00145027	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and now use the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
AID00145028	What puzzles me is why these men have been allowed to run wild for so long unchecked. Why has the NCR not retaken this place?
AID00145029	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
AID00145030	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
AID00145031	Eventually, the NCR got around to putting the prisoners down, but not until they had wreaked havoc on nearby trade routes.
AID00145032	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
AID00145033	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
AID00145034	Eventually, the NCR tried to put the prisoners down, but they were overwhelmed by them, and haven't sent troops to the area since.
AID00145035	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
AID00145036	I was hoping to speak to you about other matters.
AID00145037	I can spare a little time. What did you want to talk about?
AID00145038	Surely you have people better suited to look for them than me.
AID00145039	The less who are aware of this situation, the better. My brothers and sisters were deeply traumatized by the losses we incurred several years ago.
AID00145040	It would be imprudent to worry them unduly without first discovering the facts of the situation.
AID00145041	Why should I help you?
AID00145042	Okay.
AID00145043	Ha-ha! Stupid human!
AID00145044	All of my caps?
AID00145045	They are very good Wind-Brahmin - all caps.
AID00145046	How much?
AID00145047	All.
AID00145048	No.
AID00145049	You not buy?! Then you die!
AID00145050	Okay.
AID00145051	Good doing business - enjoy Wind-Brahmin.
AID00145052	All I see are tumbleweeds.
AID00145053	Yes - the herd.
AID00145054	Oh, you're crazy, aren't you.
AID00145055	Crazy with low prices on Wind-Brahmin. You buy one.
AID00145056	What herd?
AID00145057	There in the corral.
AID00145058	The tumbleweeds?
AID00145059	Doggies!
AID00145060	'Wind-Brahmin'? You mean the tumbleweeds?
AID00145061	Tumble-whats?
AID00145062	Ahh! Where did you come from!
AID00145063	Right here... where did you come from?
AID00145064	I don't like being followed, robot.
AID00145065	Now-now, it ain't my fault that Dorothy and the Tin Man happened to be on the same yellow-striped road, is it?
AID00145066	You see what happened in there?
AID00145067	Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looked all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
AID00145068	Goodbye.
AID00145069	Look me up when you get to New Vegas - I'll buy the first round.
AID00145070	Did you see Benny come this way?
AID00145071	Benny'? Fancy-pant's name is Benny? No, but I reckon that 'Bunny' hopped his way back to New Vegas.
AID00145072	Fancy-pants? No, I ain't seen hide-nor-hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings. I'm sure he ran back to the soft-living of New Vegas, 'though.
AID00145073	It's good to see you again, Victor.
AID00145074	Yup, but this is getting a might embarrassing - people are going to start to talk. <laughs>
AID00145075	How did you get here?
AID00145076	Just rolling along on my spurs. Looks like I just might make it to New Vegas after all.
AID00145077	LilyBreakEnd
AID00145078	Ohh... that was a bad one, wasn't it, Leo?
AID00145079	Grandma's feeling calmer now, dearie.
AID00145080	Oh my stars, did I do all of this?
AID00145081	Gracious me, I lost control a bit there!
AID00145082	Why is it hard to remember them?
AID00145083	It's my medicine, dearie. It keeps me calm, but it makes my memory go all fuzzy. That's why I only take my dosage every other time.
AID00145084	That way at least I remember their faces.
AID00145085	What was that recording you were listening to?
AID00145086	Oh, that old thing? That's a holotape from the last time I visited my grandkids. Such sweet little children, you know. Little angels.
AID00145087	Sometimes it's hard to remember them, so I take that old tape out from time to time and listen.
AID00145088	I'll risk you having more psychotic breaks if it means you're more dangerous in combat.
AID00145089	All right, dear. If you're really sure.
AID00145090	That's good. Do that.
AID00145091	All right, pumpkin.
AID00145092	On second thought....
AID00145093	Yes, dearie?
AID00145094	I'm sure. I'd rather you didn't have any psychotic breaks, even if it means you aren't as strong.
AID00145095	Well, all right, then, dearie. I suppose I'll have my holotapes to remind me of Becky and Jimmy....
AID00145096	Never mind, we'll talk about it later.
AID00145097	Whenever you're ready, dear.
AID00145098	That medicine isn't doing you any good. I want you to stop taking it altogether.
AID00145099	Oh my stars! Are you sure? If I don't take any medicine at all, Leo gets especially cranky. I can't stop him when he's like that.
AID00145100	You should keep taking your meds every other time. It's worth the risk to remember your family.
AID00145101	That's sweet of you, dearie. I'll try to be better about controlling myself if I see you try to sneak away.
AID00145102	It's too dangerous for you to miss doses. From now on I want you to take your medicine every time.
AID00145103	Are you sure, dearie? Taking my medicine all the time makes me feel woozy, but it does make it easier for me to ignore Leo.
AID00145104	Why don't you take your medicine?
AID00145105	Sometimes it makes grandma forget things she doesn't want to forget, pumpkin.
AID00145106	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat. Have you seen anyone like that?
AID00145107	Well he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of a gentleman to me.
AID00145108	Had his nose stuck so high in the air, you couldn't see it above the clouds. City folk, they always think they deserve better than what they got.
AID00145109	Those hoodlums he was with seemed to know Manny for some reason. He's our daytime sniper, up in the dinosaur's mouth.
AID00145110	Can't say as I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
AID00145111	Maybe ask Jeannie May. Nothing happens in this town that she don't know about. She'll be up in the lobby, most days.
AID00145112	Sure have. Camouflage, that coat was, trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers.
AID00145113	But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put the checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
AID00145114	They stayed here a night, and was up by the dinosaur talking to the sniper fella with the moustache a couple of times.
AID00145115	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs, if that's what you're wondering. Sounded like he didn't have his money with him.
AID00145116	His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be, too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
AID00145117	Manny might know more about them. Thought he might've been friends with one or two of 'em. He's up in the dino mouth during the day.
AID00145118	No, but I've been laid up for a while now. Haven't been able to keep an eye on things like usual.
AID00145119	It's a small town, though. I'm sure someone would've noticed somebody like that if they came this way.
AID00145120	Can I get a code to use the VR pods in the mess hall?
AID00145121	No. Those aren't for outsiders to use. Leave them alone.
AID00145122	Okay, I was just curious.
AID00145123	Anything else you need? I've got work to do.
AID00145124	<Speech>
AID00145125	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you genuinely care so much, they're flight simulators. If you don't know our history yet, you should see Pete and get the tour.
AID00145126	We dream to one day rule the skies.
AID00145127	I'm genuinely interested in your people's history. What are the pods for?
AID00145128	[FAILED] Talk to Pete if you're so curious.
AID00145129	I'm genuinely interested in your people's history. What are the pods for?
AID00145130	<Confirmed Bachelor>
AID00145131	You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
AID00145132	A "personal matter," eh? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
AID00145133	So tell me about this dame.
AID00145134	How exactly do you plan to get the plane back here?
AID00145135	I just told you, the robots are going to handle it. They'll break the plane down into pieces and move it up from Callville Bay in one shot.
AID00145136	Glad to have helped.
AID00145137	Hey, I better get rolling. Jack and I have a lot of work ahead of us!
AID00145138	<Intelligence>
AID00145139	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly. We'll be shelling an unoccupied location in Outer Vegas to get their attention elsewhere.
AID00145140	By the time they realize they aren't under attack, the plane and the bots will be long gone.
AID00145141	The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it wise to not start up a war just as the lady has risen.
AID00145142	Are you planning to use diversionary tactics to draw their attention?
AID00145143	[FAILED] We've got that covered. They won't be a problem.
AID00145144	Let's just say they'll be a little distracted for a while.
AID00145145	But won't that attract the attention of the NCR?
AID00145146	Okay, well I'm glad to have helped.
AID00145147	I have more to turn in.
AID00145148	Let's talk about something else.
AID00145149	All right.
AID00145150	I'd like to buy some food.
AID00145151	Here is what we have available.
AID00145152	I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
AID00145153	Goodbye.
AID00145154	Bye.
AID00145155	Could I buy some spare munitions?
AID00145156	Sure. Pearl gave the green light. Take a look at the manifest.
AID00145157	Not without Pearl's permission, and she hasn't given permission.
AID00145158	Goodbye.
AID00145159	Later.
AID00145160	All right, I'm going.
AID00145161	You're still welcome to dine with us, of course. We've just had quite enough of paying you to play our games.
AID00145162	Fine. Glad you could make me rich.
AID00145163	What? Why?
AID00145164	For a while, you were the toast of the Ultra-Luxe, but you're simply not en vogue any longer. Your act has gotten stale.
AID00145165	Where did you take my weapons?
AID00145166	They'll be handled with the utmost security in our bank.
AID00145167	[Attack] Looks like I'll have to kill you, then.
AID00145168	Well, I never.
AID00145169	Could I trouble you to blow it out your ass?
AID00145170	How frightfully uncouth. I'm afraid I must insist you relinquish your weapons.
AID00145171	Why do you need my guns?
AID00145172	I'm afraid those are the rules. If you don't like it you can take your business elsewhere.
AID00145173	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
AID00145174	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
AID00145175	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel.  It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
AID00145176	Please, enjoy your stay.
AID00145177	Sure, here you go.
AID00145178	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
AID00145179	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel.  It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
AID00145180	Please, enjoy your stay.
AID00145181	<Upgrade Status::Verification>
AID00145182	Why don't you want the Brotherhood to have it?
AID00145183	The Brotherhood is all about keeping technology to themselves, and using what they find to protect themselves.
AID00145184	They are isolationist and belligerent. I have no doubt that they plan to use the data for weapons research.
AID00145185	Ok, you can take it for a little while.
AID00145186	Thank you. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can with the upgraded weapons systems.
AID00145187	What are you going to do with it?
AID00145188	First I'm going to pull off whatever log data I can. Then, I'll use some of the tech around here to upgrade its weapons systems.
AID00145189	Shouldn't be more than a few days work.
AID00145190	What would you like it for?
AID00145191	I've heard through our channels that it has some research that may be related to Enclave and Poseidon Energy technology.
AID00145192	I'd like to get what I can from it and use that data for the good of humanity... ALL of humanity, unlike the Brotherhood.
AID00145193	Can you tell me about the followers?
AID00145194	There are plenty of people here to talk to you about us and our mission. Let's get to brass tacks and talk about that robot.
AID00145195	I'll have to think on this more.
AID00145196	Okay, but I'd really like to take a look at him. Remember, I'll be able to give his armor some extra plating while I've got him here.
AID00145197	vDialogueYesManSecuritronUpgrade
AID00145198	Step closer to the demonstration area, please!
AID00145199	Okay, so you're familiar with Securitrons by now, obviously! I mean, some of your best friends are Securitrons, right?
AID00145200	Our titanium alloy housing does a good job of protecting our delicate electronic insides from small arms fire and shrapnel!
AID00145201	Our left arm contains an X-25 gatling laser, quite deadly against soft targets at medium range. That looks like fun!
AID00145202	And for close-range suppression and crowd control, we have this handy-dandy 9mm submachinegun! Nice!
AID00145203	All of this is old hat, right?
AID00145204	Here's where it gets interesting! Turns out those are our secondary weapons!
AID00145205	All this time we've been running the Mark I operating system, which doesn't have drivers for our primary weapons! Imagine!
AID00145206	Now watch this - I'm downloading the Mark II OS to all the Securitrons on the network. Makes quite a difference!
AID00145207	With the M-235 Missile Launcher, we can engage ground and air targets at long range!
AID00145208	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system makes us deadly in close-range engagements! Whoo, look at that!
AID00145209	The OS upgrade also includes drivers for our onboard auto-repair systems! Just try to hurt us now!
AID00145210	All together, this software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness - per unit!
AID00145211	New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
AID00145212	I hope you enjoyed this demonstration! You can come back up and see me or be on your way - I know you're a busy person!
AID00145213	What do I do?
AID00145214	All you have to do is destroy the power generators! Without the generators, Hoover Dam's just a big bunch of concrete!
AID00145215	Take this override module - it's just like the one you used at the El Dorado Substation.
AID00145216	Install the override module on the terminal in the power control room! I'll disable the generator failsafes, and you can do the rest.
AID00145217	Good luck! See you at the dam!
AID00145218	You want me to destroy Hoover Dam?
AID00145219	Not the whole thing, thank goodness! That'd be really hard!
AID00145220	Fine, just tell me how.
AID00145221	The dam is too valuable to destroy!
AID00145222	That's exactly why this will work! Just hear me out...
AID00145223	What are you talking about?
AID00145224	You remember how the Securitron army at the Fort got destroyed? For very, very good reasons, of course...
AID00145225	Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force -  but not enough to keep them from coming back!
AID00145226	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
AID00145227	Just tell me what to do.
AID00145228	I wish I could, but I'm neuro-computationally incapable of making decisions like this one! It's up to you!
AID00145229	What sort of options?
AID00145230	You could rout the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
AID00145231	That'll wake up the Securitron army you left on standby and give us enough force to push the Legion and the NCR straight out of the Mojave!
AID00145232	The other option is destroy the dam's generators. Without those, it's just a big bunch of concrete! The NCR won't have any reason to stick around!
AID00145233	You don't have to decide yet! For now, all you have to do is take this override module and install it on the terminal in the power control room!
AID00145234	Good luck! See you at the dam!
AID00145235	I have some things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
AID00145236	Forget the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
AID00145237	I've already made arrangements with the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
AID00145238	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
AID00145239	It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
AID00145240	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
AID00145241	It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
AID00145242	All right, I'll go talk to the Followers.
AID00145243	Wonderful! I'll keep tabs on the situation at the dam! See you in a bit!
AID00145244	I have a few things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
AID00145245	Sure, no problem! So long as the Legion doesn't attack before you can get there! Which I'm sure they won't!
AID00145246	What is the final phase of the plan?
AID00145247	Well, the Legion is going to attack Hoover Dam one of these days! And the NCR is going to defend it!
AID00145248	One side will lose, and the other will win! But the side that wins will be weak, because a lot of its soldiers will be dead!
AID00145249	That's when all our Securitrons will show up! We'll declare an Independent Vegas, and tell the side that won the dam - to scram!
AID00145250	Or the Securitrons will kill all of them, too!
AID00145251	VMQTopsYesManSafetyLines
AID00145252	Here, take a look at this print-out. It covers all the details!
AID00145253	This print-out describes the situation in more detail!
AID00145254	Take this print-out. It'll tell you what to do!
AID00145255	Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
AID00145256	This print-out covers everything you need to know!
AID00145257	Take a look at this print-out. I may have said things wrong a moment ago.
AID00145258	Here's a print-out with some additional information.
AID00145259	Who am I to argue with a solution like that?
AID00145260	If you say so, that's good enough for me!
AID00145261	All right, I'll cross them off the list!
AID00145262	VMQTopsYesManTransfer
AID00145263	So this is what the rest of the world looks like!
AID00145264	Everything looks bigger than I imagined!
AID00145265	Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
AID00145266	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
AID00145267	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
AID00145268	LilyDogs
AID00145269	Nice puppies - do doggies want treats?
AID00145270	LilyBoomers
AID00145271	Ahh! Loud! Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightninetenonetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineten!
AID00145272	LilyVault
AID00145273	My, my, this reminds me of when I was a girl. Right over there would have been where your grandpa and I had our first kiss!
AID00145274	LilyNovac
AID00145275	Ooh, look, pumpkin! A dinosaur! Do you want to ride the dinosaur?
AID00145276	LilyTheStrip
AID00145277	My, aren't all these lights fancy?
AID00145278	LilyBlackMountain
AID00145279	I wonder if Marcus knows about this place....
AID00145280	Never mind.
AID00145281	Oh. Well, all right.
AID00145282	Your room will be the one upstairs, closest to the lobby side.
AID00145283	Here's your key. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your stay better for you.
AID00145284	I can't afford 100 caps right now.
AID00145285	Well that's nothing to be ashamed of. We all have money troubles from time to time.
AID00145286	You just come on back when you can afford it, and that room's all yours.
AID00145287	Here's 100 caps.
AID00145288	I'm glad you can stay with us.
AID00145289	I'd like to rent a room.
AID00145290	I can't see as how I'd charge you after the generous things you've done for the town. The room's on me.
AID00145291	Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least till the busy season comes. Sound good?
AID00145292	I'm sure I can get help with supply shortages.
AID00145293	Even if that were the case, we still need more incentive to help Vegas.
AID00145294	You would establish a foothold in the region and be one step closer to rebuilding the Mojave.
AID00145295	I think I see now what you intend to set in motion.
AID00145296	If this plan will bring us one step closer to revitalizing the region, you can count on our support.
AID00145297	So long as you can keep us supplied, we will stay in the Mojave to provide care and education for those in need.
AID00145298	I'll be on my way.
AID00145299	Be careful out there! It won't be long before the Legion makes its move!
AID00145300	What will the override module let you do?
AID00145301	I'll use the Substation to send a huge jolt of electricity to the Lucky 38! Turns out this casino has its own reactor! All it needs is a jumpstart!
AID00145302	With the reactor running at full-tilt, I can boost the transmission strength of the Lucky 38's command and control network!
AID00145303	Okay, I'll get it done.
AID00145304	Great! When this is taken care of, we'll be all set for the Legion to make its move.
AID00145305	I don't care what happens to Kimball.
AID00145306	Fine by me! We've got more important things to take care of!
AID00145307	The NCR hates me. They won't let me within 1000 feet of Kimball.
AID00145308	You are so misunderstood! Well, it's their loss!
AID00145309	Forget about the President! We've got something more important to take care of!
AID00145310	I might be able to convince the NCR to let me help out.
AID00145311	All right. A Ranger named Grant is in charge of security for the visit. He's the one you'll have to convince.
AID00145312	After you've resolved the situation with the President, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
AID00145313	I'm on good terms with the NCR. They'll let me help protect him.
AID00145314	Great! A Ranger named Grant has been placed in charge of security for the President's visit. You'll want to talk to him.
AID00145315	Once the President is safe, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
AID00145316	Why did Mr. House want Kimball kept alive?
AID00145317	Mr. House ran projections on how the NCR public will react to a defeat at Hoover Dam! Overwhelmingly, they'll blame Kimball!
AID00145318	But if Kimball dies at Hoover Dam, there's no obvious scapegoat for them to blame! So they'll blame New Vegas instead!
AID00145319	So that means reduced tourism for up to five years! The equations are pretty complicated! Mr. House sure liked numbers!
AID00145320	I'm not going to let Benny get away.
AID00145321	I can't say I understand your obsession, but for that I suppose I'd have to spend a night in your grave.
AID00145322	Fine. I'll stick with you. Just remember this. If you want something from Caesar, sooner or later you'll have to give him his due.
AID00145323	Once we get close to Caesar, we can strike.
AID00145324	Et tu, mi amice?
AID00145325	Et tu, mi amica?
AID00145326	I have to commend you on your sense of historical propriety, but have you given more than a passing thought to how we would escape?
AID00145327	No disrespect intended, but you aren't the first person to dream up the idea.
AID00145328	Just give me a sign when you're about to pull out the dagger so I know when to make a run for the cliffs.
AID00145329	Let's just listen to him, figure out what he's up to, and get out.
AID00145330	Short of canceling our imminent travel plans, that's the best thing you could have said.
AID00145331	Just be careful. If we travel at Caesar's pleasure, he may not let us out as easily as he lets us in.
AID00145332	I just want to hear Caesar out.
AID00145333	Very optimistic of you. You'll make a good Follower someday assuming Caesar doesn't have us both crucified.
AID00145334	If you say so.
AID00145335	Did I say something? Sorry. Don't pay any attention to me. Just babbling. Nonsense, really. Babbling nonsense.
AID00145336	Memories of what?
AID00145337	Oh, uh... of hearing stories. About energy weapons. They're... pretty crazy. Yeah.
AID00145338	Do the Followers use a lot of energy weapons?
AID00145339	Energy weapons? Of course not.
AID00145340	I mean... but, we study all sorts of science and technology so, you know, we... you just kind of get familiar with them. Yeah.
AID00145341	Why don't you come with me?
AID00145342	I can't leave now. Caesar has gained too much ground. I need to be here in case the NCR fails to hold Hoover Dam.
AID00145343	No offense intended, but why should I go anywhere with you?
AID00145344	Do you know much about Caesar?
AID00145345	I don't know anything that the others couldn't tell you. Caesar was one of the Followers. Before my time, of course.
AID00145346	He wanted to rebuild the new world in the image of the old. A sad story of good intentions gone bad. In that regard, he's hardly unique.
AID00145347	If you set aside his leadership capabilities, extensive knowledge, and ruthless cunning, he's just another jerk who steps on people to get his way.
AID00145348	Where did you learn that?
AID00145349	Not from the Legion, if that's what you're getting at. Books. Sheet music. Gladiator movie holotapes. Bits and pieces here and there.
AID00145350	The Followers have extensive libraries, but we all draw water from the same old well. Even Caesar.
AID00145351	Nihi-what?
AID00145352	Oh. Sorry. "There is nothing new under the sun."
AID00145353	If agave and mesquite were that miraculous, the locals would have figured it out a few thousand years ago.
AID00145354	Isn't that the language that Caesar's Legion speaks?
AID00145355	Caesar can cite Cato to suit his purpose. Many people have spoken Latin. Some of them were quite pleasant.
AID00145356	It's unfortunate that the language is now associated with the gentlemen across the river.
AID00145357	What kinds of illnesses and injuries?
AID00145358	Cuts, lacerations, broken bones. Infections resulting from all of the above. Common cold, influenza. Take your pick.
AID00145359	There are plenty of ways to die out here, and most of them, surprisingly, don't have anything to do with war. Just common human fragility.
AID00145360	What's the goal?
AID00145361	For the past hundred years or so, the Followers have managed to get by using salvaged medical supplies from the Old World.
AID00145362	But the side effect of medical success is that more people live longer. Funny how that works.
AID00145363	Eventually, we'll run out of hospitals to loot. We need new ways to produce those supplies. Or maybe old ways, if this research goes anywhere.
AID00145364	You don't sound too enthusiastic about it.
AID00145365	I'm enthusiastic about helping people, but nihil novi sub sole.
AID00145366	Why do you do research instead of providing medical assistance?
AID00145367	Not all Followers are "people persons." Besides, someone needs to do research. I have no problem with Julie sticking me back here.
AID00145368	Out of sight, out of mind. There are worse things one can be, though I do admit, it is a bit boring.
AID00145369	Though it has a noble goal, I don't think this research will yield much fruit. No pun intended.
AID00145370	Like I said before, not all Followers are good with people.
AID00145371	I'm fine doing research back here, even if it is a bit boring... and pointless... and a complete waste of time.
AID00145372	Don't mind me. I'm just voicing my thoughts so they don't burrow out of my skull in a fit of abject despondency.
AID00145373	What kind of research?
AID00145374	Oh, you know. Finding alternative treatments for common illnesses and injuries. Stimpaks out of barrel cacti and other fantastic improbabilities.
AID00145375	As far as fruitless wastes of time go, it's quite noble in its aims.
AID00145376	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
AID00145377	Huh? Hey, I think you dropped your gun there. Here. Here you go. Just don't point it at me, okay?
AID00145378	I'm paranoid now, and even though you clearly don't know how to hold that thing, it'd be one less thing for me to worry about. Thanks.
AID00145379	Did you know there's a nerve on your neck that helps you sleep? It's... uh... I know it's here...
AID00145380	You're weird. Please stop that.
AID00145381	Maybe beating your head on a rock will fix it.
AID00145382	Who are you, again?
AID00145383	Maybe my weak and flimsy hands can massage that out for you.<Apply Sleeper Hold>
AID00145384	What the-? Don't touch me. I could get a better massage from a baby.
AID00145385	Er... join the White Glove Society. They're cannibals, but that's probably a step up for you.
AID00145386	What? Are you crazy?
AID00145387	Will you serve human flesh at the Gourmand?
AID00145388	Oh, I very much doubt that. What fun would it be if everyone could have it?
AID00145389	Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if our chef used it here and there as a secret ingredient to make his dishes really come alive.
AID00145390	What's next, now that the White Glove Society has tasted human flesh again?
AID00145391	Now that it's been accepted, it will become a regular course for us.
AID00145392	It's a new and exciting frontier for our chef. I've never seen him so cheerful.
AID00145393	How is your new cuisine faring?
AID00145394	Why it's splendid. Simply to die for.
AID00145395	Mortimer told me about you, you know. What a pair of mischief makers you two are!
AID00145396	But the new entrees are fresh and bold and I have the two of you to thank for it.
AID00145397	How do I get in?
AID00145398	Anything you can do to help me?
AID00145399	What can you tell me about the Great Khans?
AID00145400	We know they supply the Fiends with illegal chems, but they never stick around in NCR territory for long. They know the land, and move quick.
AID00145401	There's talk from time to time about taking out their base at Red Rock Canyon, but nothing ever comes of it. The Great Khans are tough fighters.
AID00145402	If we ever did go up against them on their home turf, we'd win, but casualties would be high.
AID00145403	You were at Bitter Springs, I'm told.
AID00145404	Yeah, I was there. I was Captain Dhatri, then. That whole situation was a mess and could easily have been avoided with good intel.
AID00145405	The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place.
AID00145406	By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started.
AID00145407	The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him. I took over and salvaged the situation as best I could.
AID00145408	For my effort, I was promoted to major. Not quite the way I'd have wanted it.
AID00145409	Goodbye.
AID00145410	What happens if I hang around one of your camps?
AID00145411	Then'll we have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
AID00145412	I'll keep that in mind.
AID00145413	See ya.

AID00145458	This is most unusual! The Powder Gangers have visitors today. I guess there's a first for everything!
AID00145459	Now those tough-looking fellows must be Great Khans. I recognize those funny helmets and leather vests from stories I've heard...
AID00145460	So what are they doing with that dapper gentleman who wears a checked suit? I wouldn't mind a suit like that.
AID00145461	They're talking about heading south toward Nipton, then west to Novac where they'll meet up with someone...
AID00145462	I guess I could track them if I needed to, but the town of Primm needs me here, to serve and protect.
AID00145463	Oh my. I think I've been spotted...
AID00145464	<Speech Options>
AID00145465	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you look to be the trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
AID00145466	You can tell me or you can rot in here.
AID00145467	[FAILED] I'm sure you mean well, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm in a calmer emotional state before my memory is going to function.
AID00145468	I'll free you... right after you tell me...
AID00145469	Can you tell me about the people who passed through town now?
AID00145470	Indeed I do good sir, and I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
AID00145471	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
AID00145472	My good lady, I believe I may have some information that would prove useful.
AID00145473	If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share what information I have with you.
AID00145474	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
AID00145475	I'm in quite a state here. If you help me with my bonds I'll be more than happy to tell you anything, and everything about those Khans.
AID00145476	Ahh yes, my memory is much clearer now that I am free from my bondage.
AID00145477	I was sku... er, performing recon, gathering information on some of the Powder Gangers, when some great Khans arrived with your friend in the suit.
AID00145478	They were talking about some delivery they took from a courier, I assume that was you.
AID00145479	They said they'd be heading through Nipton to Novac to meet a contact there.
AID00145480	Can you tell me about the man in the checkered suit who came through here?
AID00145481	I overheard them saying that they are on their way to Novac. If you want to follow them I strongly suggest that you follow the road through Nipton.
AID00145482	There are a lot of dangerous things out in the desert, and you won't have me with you to protect you, as I need to stay here and keep Primm safe.
AID00145483	Can you tell me where the man in the checkered suit went again?
AID00145484	Earlier, it seemed like you knew Tabitha. What's the story there?
AID00145485	Tabitha was grandma's squad leader when we both worked for the Master. She wasn't very nice at all, but she was good at the chopping.
AID00145486	Almost as good as Leo....
AID00145487	LilyTabitha
AID00145488	Tabitha! You naughty, naughty girl! Leo remembers what you did!
AID00145489	Let's talk about something else.
AID00145490	What'd you have in mind?
AID00145491	Is that when you settled out here with your wife?
AID00145492	Eventually we made our way out here. But uh...
AID00145493	Well, when folks spend their lives in isolation, sometimes that ain't the best of things for learning to fight off germs.
AID00145494	We was going to California, but Goodsprings was as far as we got. After she passed, wasn't no reason to keep going.
AID00145495	I stayed so I could keep close to her.
AID00145496	I saw your old vault on the Strip. Vault 21, right? Mr. House filled it with concrete?
AID00145497	Yep. He sure did. Wanted himself a hotel, and to make sure once he made the change there'd never be any going back.
AID00145498	We didn't get a say. Don't know how you'd argue with a fella like that anyways, everywhere and nowhere all at once.
AID00145499	So just like that, we was all homeless. Went our separate ways, and that was all she wrote.
AID00145500	You said before you had something taken from you.
AID00145501	Well, ain't we all, right? That was a long time ago. I don't pay it much mind anymore.
AID00145502	Give me a name, and I'll take care of it.
AID00145503	Can you tell me anything more?
AID00145504	Forget it, I'll bring her here.
AID00145505	Good, getting tired of questions from you when I should be getting answers. Bring her here.
AID00145506	I'm not doing this for you.
AID00145507	Guess Gloria was wrong about you, then. Get out of here, you're no use to me.
AID00145508	Nowhere.
AID00145509	"Nowhere's" a strange place to get an idea like that.
AID00145510	You know what, you're new. Gloria's not going to miss you. And I'm not going to risk you saying the same thing to that bitch I'm hunting for.
AID00145511	Found out from investigating the wreckage.
AID00145512	And after all the trouble I went through to kill all those witnesses. Guess now I have one more than I thought.
AID00145513	These contract papers, for one.
AID00145514	So, looks like we have us a thief. All right, guess I'm talking to you instead of the girl.
AID00145515	If I run across her, I'll let her know.
AID00145516	What did you want to talk to her about?
AID00145517	If your answer isn't "yes, I'll bring her here" or "no, I won't, cause Gloria had me pegged wrong," then we're done here.
AID00145518	Anything you can say to her, you can say to me.
AID00145519	You don't want us chatting, trust me. As for the girl - I just want to talk to her.
AID00145520	And if you can't bring her here, you're no use to me - or Gloria. So if you want to cause trouble in here over nothing, then go on - try.
AID00145521	Why don't you do it?
AID00145522	I got business here, need to watch the shop, make sure things are running - smoothly.
AID00145523	Besides, if I came for the girl, I'm not all friendly and charming like you are. She might get the wrong idea.
AID00145524	Is it because the Van Graffs attacked her caravan?
AID00145525	I had nothing to do with that, and neither did anyone here. Now where would you have gotten an idea like that?
AID00145526	Do you know where she is?
AID00145527	Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
AID00145528	Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
AID00145529	She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
AID00145530	I doubt Cass will listen to anything I have to say.
AID00145531	What? You two on the outs? Ain't that a shame.
AID00145532	Guess you misheard me - I wasn't asking you a question. Find a way to get her here.
AID00145533	If you can't bring her here, then make sure she never leaves the Outpost, and that's fine with me.
AID00145534	Cass? She's in the Mojave Outpost.
AID00145535	Really. NCR all around her.
AID00145536	Well, tell you what. You find a way to bring her here. She'll want to hear what I have to say.
AID00145537	Cass is dead.
AID00145538	Dead? What... by you? Yeah, I can tell, you had something to do with it.
AID00145539	Gloria was right about you. You take care of business before it's a problem.
AID00145540	[Terrifying Presence] Raise that gun, and I'll kill everyone in here.
AID00145541	You know what, I think you mean that. All right... maybe...
AID00145542	You shoot, you'll regret it.
AID00145543	Really. We'll see about that.
AID00145544	I'm not with her, so watch the spread.
AID00145545	Sounds good, kill her.
AID00145546	Waited too long to finish this, last loose end, all wrapped up.
AID00145547	HiddenValleyRepConsequences
AID00145548	Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
AID00145549	If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
AID00145550	You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
AID00145551	We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
AID00145552	There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
AID00145553	We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
AID00145554	VEndingCourierFemale
AID00145555	The Courier, fair and even-handed in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
AID00145556	She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AID00145557	Though the Courier's agenda was a mystery to many, she was honored by NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
AID00145558	She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AID00145559	With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
AID00145560	Despite her extreme actions, she was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AID00145561	Though the Courier herself was just and forthright in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, she helped the Legion achieve victory.
AID00145562	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00145563	The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
AID00145564	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00145565	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
AID00145566	Caesar honored her with a  golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AID00145567	The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
AID00145568	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, both out of gratitude and a quiet pride in his choice of lieutenants.
AID00145569	The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
AID00145570	Mr. House kept New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations, and afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
AID00145571	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
AID00145572	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, mostly as a reward, but partly out of fear.
AID00145573	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
AID00145574	She ensured that Mr. House's tyranny was broken and that neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
AID00145575	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
AID00145576	She had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
AID00145577	Supporting all of the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
AID00145578	She ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
AID00145579	I'm not actually armed.
AID00145580	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
AID00145581	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
AID00145582	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
AID00145583	Here you go.
AID00145584	Pleasure doing business with you.
AID00145585	You still haven't said where these guys were going.
AID00145586	Go on.
AID00145587	VFSBaitThugGetHim
AID00145588	Get him!
AID00145589	Get her!
AID00145590	Ooh, look. A body. I really should be going.
AID00145591	What's your rush? The boys and I here want to get to know you better.
AID00145592	Friend of yours?
AID00145593	Nah, just some idiot that wandered down the wrong alley. Sound familiar?
AID00145594	Who is that?
AID00145595	The last person stupid enough to follow me down this alley. Get this fool, boys!
AID00145596	FreesideRepConsequences
AID00145597	Hey, you're the one who's been going around helping people around here, right? The King says to keep up the good work, and said to give you this.
AID00145598	You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
AID00145599	The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
AID00145600	Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
AID00145601	Give me all of your ca- whoa, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was you. Please don't hurt me. I've got a wife! And kids! And pets and stuff!
AID00145602	PapaKhanKarl
AID00145603	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AID00145604	You need me more than I need you - don't forget that.
AID00145605	We'll see about that. In any case, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
AID00145606	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
AID00145607	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
AID00145608	Let's move on, then.
AID00145609	Yes, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
AID00145610	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
AID00145611	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
AID00145612	Apology accepted.
AID00145613	Caesar's death is regrettable, but we can't let it stand in the way of the Legion's goals.
AID00145614	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
AID00145615	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
AID00145616	Can I buy out the rest of his contract for 300 caps?
AID00145617	Yeah, that sounds alright to me. I bet we can find someone to do his work for that much. Tell him to get going.
AID00145618	What about Primm Slim? Could he be sheriff?
AID00145619	Well I reckon he could be a sheriff if you have the skills to reprogram him.
AID00145620	Do you think Primm Slim could be sheriff?
AID00145621	Well I guess I never thought of that. I guess he could be sheriff, if you think he could be reprogrammed for it.
AID00145622	Goodbye.
AID00145623	Yeah, go on.

AID00145626	VikkiVanceCasinoManagerTopic
AID00145627	Wow, this is our first hot streak since we opened this place back up! Here's a little something, on the house.
AID00145628	You're doing great! Keep on spending money, hopefully we'll get some extra action in here.
AID00145629	You're the luckiest player I've ever seen. Keep up the good work in here.
AID00145630	I'm sorry, you've done so much good stuff for us here in Primm, but we just can't afford to lose any more money to you.
AID00145631	I can't let you play here anymore.
AID00145632	Ted's dead.
AID00145633	Confound it. I knew I shoulda stayed with him. Ted, I'm so sorry, boy.
AID00145634	I demand to know who did this!
AID00145635	Ted's been kidnapped. He's here in the hotel.
AID00145636	He's here? Bless you, I thought he was a goner for sure.
AID00145637	Listen, you do what you gotta do to find him. I'd send my men with you but I'm worried they'd kill Ted if we got close.
AID00145638	Reckon you might need one of these. Take it. Just don't wave it around here where they might take it from you.
AID00145639	Let's talk about something else.
AID00145640	Whatever suits you.
AID00145641	What are they doing?
AID00145642	I don't know what they're up to and I don't want to know. I just hope no harm comes to Novac.
AID00145643	Not much to live off of around here, except salvage from that factory. If they made off with anything expensive, we'd be hurting something fierce.
AID00145644	But I will say this. If all of 'em turned up dead tomorrow, I couldn't see as to how they'd be missed.
AID00145645	That might even be a desirable thing, knowing the town was safe from the likes of them. There'd be a reward in it if some brave soul made it happen.

AID00145655	RadioOpLine01
AID00145656	Why is the NCR interested in this desert?
AID00145657	It is no secret. Our interest here is two fold.
AID00145658	First, we want to remain in control of Hoover Dam. It supplies the Republic with power, and is a source of fresh water.
AID00145659	Second, we want to prevent the Legion from advancing across the Colorado River and endangering the home states.
AID00145660	What's the Legion?
AID00145661	Caesar's Legion.
AID00145662	A bunch of degenerate slavers, led by a madman who calls himself Caesar. Every one of them is a barbarian to the last.
AID00145663	I've even heard one of their leaders, the Legate or something, goes around with a human skull on his head. Savages to the last.
AID00145664	Can you tell me more about the NCR?
AID00145665	Sure can. The NCR was founded from the survivors of one of the great Vaults. We started as a small settlement called Shady Sands.
AID00145666	We now consist of 5 states, that make up the greatest nation since the Great War.
AID00145667	What's the New California Republic?
AID00145668	Where do you come from that you haven't heard of the NCR? Nevermind, it doesn't matter much.
AID00145669	If you haven't heard of us, you must not be from the Legion. Put simply, the NCR is the greatest nation currently functioning.
AID00145670	What was Project SEMELE?
AID00145671	Another one of Poseidon Energy's many secret weapons projects. Before the Great War. It didn't go anywhere.
AID00145672	That's how REPCONN got their shot. So to speak.
AID00145673	An odd combination.
AID00145674	REPCONN went through some rough times. When their rocket business was shaky, Mr. House purchased the company.
AID00145675	It didn't take long for him to repurpose their plasma technology for a government weapon contract.
AID00145676	What kind of prototypes?
AID00145677	Plasma rifles. They were intended to replace the P94 plasma caster.
AID00145678	There was some corporate espionage going on between Poseidon Energy's Project SEMELE and whatever was going on here.
AID00145679	I need a good-looking doctor to help take care of me in the big, bad wasteland.
AID00145680	Overt flirtation will get you everywhere, you know.
AID00145681	On a slightly more serious note, if you're interested in helping out with the troubles plaguing Freeside, I can come with you.
AID00145682	Just don't do anything obnoxious, like trying to help Caesar's Legion, and we should be fine. Understood?
AID00145683	Well, uh... on second thought...
AID00145684	Of course. I'm not interested in helping the Legion.
AID00145685	Oh, well... in that case, never mind.
AID00145686	I'm not sure why you thought a Follower would want to help Caesar after all of the misery he's visited on us and the people we try to help.
AID00145687	Well, good luck to you in your future endeavors, assuming they don't involve Caesar.
AID00145688	Fair enough.
AID00145689	All right. Let's not waste any time. There are people out there to help, things to learn. Maybe not in that order, but let's get to it.
AID00145690	Uh... it beats sitting around here all day, doesn't it?
AID00145691	Uh... probably not. Until things settle down around here, alleviating my boredom isn't a good motive to leave. Sorry.
AID00145692	Ugh. Well if you're going to be like that then never mind.
AID00145693	Yes. The Followers do not like Caesar or Caesar's Legion. You should also not like them. If you do, you like hurting people and that is bad. Goodbye.
AID00145694	Yeah, I guess. So are you coming with me or what?
AID00145695	This place is really complicated and stuff. You're smart. Can you help me do... things?
AID00145696	Hmm. Wow. You sound like you really do need some help. Look, I can help you out, but you can't do anything stu-
AID00145697	I mean, you can't... help bad people, who want to hurt the locals in Freeside. If you do, I'll leave. Does that make sense?
AID00145698	Things are bad around here. I'd like to make a difference, and I'd like you to help me.
AID00145699	Hmm. That seems appropriately resolute and yet vague. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and go with you, but let me be clear about something.
AID00145700	If you plan to help Caesar's Legion, this is going to be a brief relationship.
AID00145701	I may not have all the answers for how to fix Freeside's problems, but Caesar taking control isn't part of the solution. Fair?
AID00145702	The NCR oppression around here would disappear if the Legion took control. I could use your help.
AID00145703	Only because everyone would be conscripted or enslaved. And the people who are unfit for military service or slavery would be put down. Swell plan.
AID00145704	Yes, a veritable Pax Romana for post-nuclear America. My political beliefs are a bit more progressive than outright fascism, so I'll pass. Thanks.
AID00145705	If New Vegas can remain independent, I'm going to find a way to do it. I could use your help.
AID00145706	If that's really what you're trying to do, I'll go with you.
AID00145707	Things are hectic around here, but it won't mean anything if NCR or the Legion take control. I'm sure the Followers can manage without me.
AID00145708	Just don't try to help the Legion, and we shouldn't have any problems. Sound good?
AID00145709	I'm trying to help Mr. House keep New Vegas independent.
AID00145710	That's funny. Mr. House doesn't want to keep New Vegas independent. He just wants to keep the NCR and Caesar's Legion from pushing him around.
AID00145711	He must be pretty convincing if he's roped you into helping him, but you can count me out.
AID00145712	The NCR needs help against the Legion before Caesar moves on the dam. We could use your skills.
AID00145713	The NCR had a chance to use the Followers' skills before, but being imperialists mattered more to them. No thanks.
AID00145714	I'm going after a man named Benny for revenge and I need someone to keep me patched up.
AID00145715	Pulling bullets out of a vengeance-crazed drifter is truly a noble step up from tending to the downtrodden of Freeside, but I think I'll pass.
AID00145716	What do you know about them?
AID00145717	Uh, what does anyone know about them? Big... flying machines, right? Crazy helicopters. So weird.
AID00145718	When was that?
AID00145719	Huh. Good question. Must have been in a book.
AID00145720	Anderson killed White. He deserved to pay for what he did.
AID00145721	Fantastic. Now the only influential person who gave a damn about Westside is gone. Great job.
AID00145722	In case I'm not laying down enough sarcasm, you just screwed up the lives of a bunch of struggling people.
AID00145723	What's done is done.
AID00145724	I guess that means you don't have to apologize to all of the people in Westside you just screwed over.
AID00145725	In case you weren't paying attention, you killed the only person who ever gave a damn about them.
AID00145726	I'm sorry. I didn't realize it would end like this.
AID00145727	Neither did Anderson.
AID00145728	Let's keep moving.
AID00145729	Of course.
AID00145730	If you say so. I'm not arguing.
AID00145731	I do say so. The Followers aren't a military organization. If anyone knew what he was up to, they weren't talking.
AID00145732	And if they knew he was stealing water, so what? Westside has more of a right to that water than the NCR.
AID00145733	Right. "The Followers don't endorse his actions," and all that.
AID00145734	Well I don't. I'm sure there were a few people turning a blind eye, but can you blame them?
AID00145735	NCR's sharecropper farms had all of the water. The nearest fresh source is the lake, and that's a bit of a hike.
AID00145736	Goodbye.
AID00145737	See you around.
AID00145738	What kind of research do you do?
AID00145739	Do you need any help?
AID00145740	Me, specifically? No. I'm sure Julie Farkas does, though. Lab coat, pointy hair. Answers to the name "Julie Farkas," strangely enough.
AID00145741	I'm sure she can find something for you to do. It might be kind of... depressing and terrible, though. Caveat Samaritanus.
AID00145742	Personally, no. But thanks to you, Julie says we're a lot better off these days. I'll take her word for it. So, thanks.
AID00145743	It says a superior is not allowed to give orders to the men under his subordinate.
AID00145744	Then that means I can cast McNamara down for giving those secret orders to my Paladins! Well done! That's exactly what I was looking for!
AID00145745	That is the standard procedure, yes. For example, McNamara gives orders to Head Scribe Taggart, who then relays further orders to the scribes.
AID00145746	I wasn't aware that failing to do so was punishable, however. Interesting...
AID00145747	If we can just find an instance where McNamara went around someone and gave orders to their subordinates, we'll have him.
AID00145748	Did you know there's a second part to it?
AID00145749	Second part? What are you talking about?
AID00145750	One of the few times an Elder was dismissed was due to it.
AID00145751	I could be wrong, but I think that's a dead end. McNamara's always followed orders, and we've been incommunicado since fleeing HELIOS.
AID00145752	Do you know anything about the Chain That Binds?
AID00145753	I could hardly call myself Head Paladin if I didn't. It's one of the first things every initiate learns when they start training. What about it?
AID00145754	I found the patrols for the Elder, and they had mission discs with orders from McNamara on them.
AID00145755	Just as I thought, McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me. The nerve of that man!
AID00145756	This little stunt is probably what got them killed in the first place. Our normal patrol routes are known to be relatively safe.
AID00145757	This is exactly what I've been looking for! McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me, thereby breaking the Chain That Binds!
AID00145758	With this, I can finally have him removed as Elder, and end this ridiculous lockdown.
AID00145759	This is exactly the kind of thing I'm trying to avoid by ousting McNamara.
AID00145760	I wanted to ask you some other questions.
AID00145761	If you must.
AID00145762	The Elder has me looking for parts to fix the bunker's air filtration system.
AID00145763	The filtration system? He wouldn't have you looking if we didn't need those parts badly, which means that system's in real trouble.
AID00145764	If the air filters go, it will become impossible to breathe down here. We'd be forced to evacuate the bunker!
AID00145765	I can't believe he's kept something like this to himself! We should have every able-bodied person in the chapter working on this.
AID00145766	All the more reason for you to find a way to get McNamara out of that chair, before he dooms us all.
AID00145767	The Elder tasked me with contacting several scouts out in the waste.
AID00145768	That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liason.
AID00145769	I've been trying to get the Elder to send out scouts for years, and he's always been resistant to the idea. Said they'd be a vulnerability.
AID00145770	I wonder what changed his mind.
AID00145771	The Elder has me looking for the lost patrols and retrieving their mission discs.
AID00145772	Yes, I know the loss of the patrols has weighed heavily on his mind for some time. He took it very personally when they first went missing.
AID00145773	That was when I first began to seriously question his ability to lead us. A commander has to be able to deal with the potential loss of his men.
AID00145774	It's strange that he would ask you to find mission discs on them, however. The missing paladins were all on standard patrols, which don't need them.
AID00145775	Only Brothers sent on special assignments are given mission discs. If you should find any on the lost patrols, let me know.
AID00145776	I wanted to ask you some questions.
AID00145777	Sure, what about?
AID00145778	No, I haven't found any of them yet.
AID00145779	I don't want to rush you or anything, but time is of the essence. Please try to find those components as soon as you can.
AID00145780	Not all of them.
AID00145781	It's amazing that you've found any of them and not gotten gruesomely mangled. Keep up the good work!
AID00145782	They're all right here.
AID00145783	Really? I mean, that's great! I knew you could do it all along. I'll get right to work installing these.
AID00145784	Why don't you go tell the Elder the good news. I'm sure it'll be a huge load off of his shoulders.
AID00145785	Just give the details.
AID00145786	The items I'll need to keep the system running are a differential pressure controller, a reverse pulse cleaner, and several  HEPA cartridge filters.
AID00145787	At present, my best guess for finding the items would be to search any of the old vaults in the area.
AID00145788	Those vaults were usually built much like these military bunkers, even using the same contractors in their constructions at times.
AID00145789	I'll mark the vaults' locations on your map. Best of luck to you.
AID00145790	Maybe you misheard me.
AID00145791	No, I heard you quite clearly. You're being sent off to be killed like the others.
AID00145792	Er, what?
AID00145793	You think you're the first person the Elder's trusted with this? He sent three of our patrols out looking for those components, and they're all dead.
AID00145794	I was the one who supplied the Elder with the location of possible sites where we could find the components, so their deaths are my fault.
AID00145795	And now it's your turn. Well, don't say you weren't warned. I won't take the blame when you die horribly. But I can tell you're getting impatient.
AID00145796	The Elder wants me to retrieve components to help fix the air filtration system.
AID00145797	...So now I'm going to have your death on my conscience, too. Great.
AID00145798	Go on.
AID00145799	The device that creates the sandstorms above, that masks our comings and goings, was only intended to be used in case of emergencies.
AID00145800	It was never meant to be used with any regularity, and the other systems here were not designed to accommodate such usage.
AID00145801	In particular, the air filtration system simply cannot handle the quantity of sand and grit that it's been forced to cope with these last few years.
AID00145802	As a result, the system is failing, albeit slowly. I'm told we have scant few months before it shuts down completely.
AID00145803	Should that happen, it will quickly become impossible to breathe here in the bunker. Already the air quality begins to slightly worsen.
AID00145804	Just tell me what you want me to do.
AID00145805	I would like you to find the components we need to fix this bunker's air filtration system. I cannot overstate the importance of this task.
AID00145806	See Senior Knight Lorenzo for the details. He's the one who brought the matter to my attention, and the only other person who is aware of it.
AID00145807	One of the datastore entries mentioned the Chain That Binds. What is that, exactly?
AID00145808	That's an old, old principle that's been around since the Brotherhood was founded. It basically means that you have to obey a superior officer.
AID00145809	It's pretty much common sense, but it gets invoked a lot when people get pissy about following orders.
AID00145810	If you're curious, I'll give you access to the datastore entry on it. You'd probably be the first to read it in years, if not decades.
AID00145811	How do I get access to more topics in the datastore?
AID00145812	Well, you'd have to get a senior-level member of the chapter to unlock a topic for you. I've given you access to what I can, but that's not much.
AID00145813	The majority of topics fall under Ramos's aegis, since they'd constitute a security risk. Good luck getting anything out of him.
AID00145814	You might have better luck with another member of the senior staff. Try talking to them about it.
AID00145815	He was going to leave if he couldn't get his radio working. So I destroyed it.
AID00145816	I see. And he's not particularly likely to come back, since he's learned that the bunkers here aren't secure enough to serve as safehouses.
AID00145817	It's not a foolproof solution, but indirect methods rarely are. What matters is that you drove him off without alerting him to our presence.
AID00145818	I convinced him that staying here was more dangerous than moving on.
AID00145819	Yes, you exploited his fear of Powder Gangers very effectively. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
AID00145820	He'll keep his distance, setting ambushes, never suspecting that these bunkers house something far more dangerous to him than criminals. Well-played.
AID00145821	Hey, I fixed your radio.
AID00145822	What? Let me see that.
AID00145823	What? That's great. I'll have to check it out when I head back tonight.
AID00145824	No, not really.
AID00145825	The desert can play tricks on a man's mind. Don't let it bother you overmuch.
AID00145826	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00145827	You're a strange one, aren'tcha? Fine, what did you want to talk about?
AID00145828	How about this explosive collar around my neck?
AID00145829	I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
AID00145830	All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
AID00145831	There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
AID00145832	That's not to say I don't believe you, bu- did you just hear something?
AID00145833	I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
AID00145834	All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
AID00145835	There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
AID00145836	That's not to say I don't believe you, just that maybe you got your facts mixed up a little. Let's head back to my camp and go over what you saw.
AID00145837	The Brotherhood of Steel has a base inside one of the bunkers here. They sent me after you.
AID00145838	A Brotherhood base? Here? Are you shitting me? No one's seen them for years.
AID00145839	I don't suppose you've got a scrap of evidence to support this wild-eyed claim of yours?
AID00145840	Who are you?
AID00145841	Dobson's my name. I'm an NCR Ranger, operating out of Camp McCarran north of here. Redding man by birth, though.
AID00145842	What are you doing here?
AID00145843	Well, I was thinking I might set this bunker up as a safehouse. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
AID00145844	'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
AID00145845	I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
AID00145846	Well, I thought I might set up a safehouse in one of the bunkers here. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
AID00145847	'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
AID00145848	I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
AID00145849	You have to get out of here.
AID00145850	Now why would I do that? You see some powder gangers on the approach or something?
AID00145851	Not sure. Just feels bad.
AID00145852	I see. Well, I'll take that under advisement.
AID00145853	
AID00145854	[SUCCEEDED] You've seen that with your own two eyes?
AID00145855	Goddamn, I knew Cooke's gang passed through these parts 'bout that frequently, but I didn't know they holed up here.
AID00145856	Be a rude awakening, to find fifteen of those merciless bastards looking down at me snoozing on my bedroll!
AID00145857	Yep, I'd be better off setting up an ambush along one of their routes to catch stragglers. Thanks for the information. You may've saved my life.
AID00145858	<Lie> Powder gangers use these bunkers as hideouts once or twice a month.
AID00145859	[FAILED] See now, thing is, I fancy myself a bit of a tracker. And I don't see much in the way of tracks 'round here.
AID00145860	Could say that's on account of the dust storms. But if there were criminals using these bunkers as hideouts, I'd know.
AID00145861	Well, criminals come through here. And the storms, they're bad. Right?
AID00145862	This seems like a bad location for a safehouse.
AID00145863	Oh? And in your expert opinion, why would that be?
AID00145864	Actually, I rigged your radio with a bomb.
AID00145865	Well, at least you're man enough to admit it. Now get the hell out of here. If I see you again, it'll be through my rifle's sight.
AID00145866	Nothing, I swear.
AID00145867	Okay, but if I find you messing with it again, there'll be hell to pay, you hear me?
AID00145868	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
AID00145869	Just kidding. You weren't doing any harm that I could see. So what do you think? Can it be fixed?
AID00145870	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
AID00145871	HVRangerFixedIt
AID00145872	I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you decided to just start tinkering with it? Let me see that.
AID00145873	I was just trying to fix it.
AID00145874	[SUCCEEDED] I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you think you fixed it in a few minutes? Let me see that.
AID00145875	[Lie] I just fixed it.
AID00145876	[FAILED] The hell you did. I know enough about electronics to know that what you were doing wasn't fixing it.
AID00145877	So I'll give you one more chance to tell me what you were doing.
AID00145878	[Lie] I just fixed it.
AID00145879	HVRangerMessWithRadio
AID00145880	Hey, what are you doing to my radio?
AID00145881	You just had to go messing with my radio again, didn't you?
AID00145882	I did what I could, but the capacitor needs to be replaced.
AID00145883	You might want to know that I fixed your radio earlier.
AID00145884	What are Powder Gangers?
AID00145885	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
AID00145886	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
AID00145887	The NCR mounted an attack not long ago but they just used regular troops - no rangers - so that didn't amount to anything.
AID00145888	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
AID00145889	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
AID00145890	So far the brass haven't mustered up enough men to take the prison back. Long overdue if you ask me. But I'm just one man.
AID00145891	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
AID00145892	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
AID00145893	Or so they did, 'til NCR brass finally mustered up enough troops to take out the trash. Wish I could've been there.
AID00145894	There's a Brotherhood of Steel base inside one of the bunkers here!
AID00145895	So no one knows you're here?
AID00145896	Standard practice. Rangers operate on our own most of the time. And that's how we like it.
AID00145897	Usually we call in our positions to McCarran to be relayed to other rangers, but I can handle myself.
AID00145898	I'm sure as hell not going to lose any sleep on account of a goddamn broken down radio. But it will shorten my stay if I can't fix it.
AID00145899	It was a complete accident, I swear.
AID00145900	Accident or no, we both now find ourselves in an uncomfortable situation.
AID00145901	No, what I told your man before was the truth. I don't like repeating myself.
AID00145902	I applaud your commitment to your own word, though it saddens me to hear of the fate of our comrades.
AID00145903	Actually, I'd rather just be going. If I could just have my belongings back...
AID00145904	I'm afraid that's not a possibility at the moment. Let's just say that your eventual safe departure from here relies on how forthcoming you are.
AID00145905	That said, I'd like you to tell me why you're here.
AID00145906	I found one of your patrols out in the waste. Your men are dead.
AID00145907	That is sad news, indeed, and I thank you for making your way here to convey it to us, but now the issue remains that an outsider knows our location.
AID00145908	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
AID00145909	What did you have in mind?
AID00145910	Hmm, on second thought...
AID00145911	Look, the Followers have had enough of a role in the misery that this area has had to endure.
AID00145912	If you want to go off half-cocked and leave a trail of corpses in your wake, that's your business. We'll do our best to clean up your mess.
AID00145913	Just don't try to drag us into it personally, okay?
AID00145914	Sounds reasonable.
AID00145915	Would you like to come with me? I could use someone skilled in medicine.
AID00145916	Hmm... I'm starting to remember hearing some rumors about you and this crazy guy called "Caesar." Bad. Not a friend of the Followers.
AID00145917	Maybe they're not all true. That's enough for me to stand here and talk to you, but I'm not about to leave Freeside as your comrade-in-arms.
AID00145918	You've helped the Followers, so you can't be entirely bad. To be honest, I haven't heard anyone say a negative word about you.
AID00145919	As long as you keep working to help people around here get a fair shake, sure, I'll lend a hand.
AID00145920	You helped the Followers, but your reputation isn't exactly spotless. How do I know you're not going to lose it out there?
AID00145921	Here's my proposition. If you want to work together to help the people around here, I'll lend a hand. If you start acting like a crazy waster...
AID00145922	Would you reconsider my offer to travel with me? I could really use your help.
AID00145923	The last time we discussed this, you didn't exactly wow me with your pitch. What have you got for me this time?
AID00145924	Good point. Goodbye.
AID00145925	You're right. Let's talk about something else.
AID00145926	Let's talk about something else.
AID00145927	Certainly.
AID00145928	What kinds of illnesses are you trying to deal with?
AID00145929	Where did you get your medical training?
AID00145930	The Followers taught me everything I know about medicine. Despite our humble abode here in New Vegas, we have great facilities back in the NCR.
AID00145931	We may have over extended ourselves by setting up camp in Freeside, but the people here need help from someone. If not us, who?
AID00145932	How did you join the Followers?
AID00145933	Honestly, it isn't too difficult if you have half a brain and aren't a complete jerk. I wanted to help people and I enjoyed learning, so I signed up.
AID00145934	New Vegas is in trouble, so I came out here. If someone doesn't step up and try to help the people here, it's going to end very badly.
AID00145935	Do you always deflect personal questions?
AID00145936	Only to obfuscate my past association with a fascist paramilitary organization.
AID00145937	I'm joking, of course. I will deflect personal questions at any opportunity.
AID00145938	I'll keep an eye on it.
AID00145939	Safety first. That's all I'm saying.
AID00145940	That sounds a little paranoid, Arcade.
AID00145941	Does it? Does it?
AID00145942	What's an eee-em-pee?
AID00145943	It's... a thing. A science thing. It hurts robots. Don't worry about it. Silly Arcade's just telling magnetic field jokes for his own amusement.
AID00145944	Ahem. Shall we?
AID00145945	Ooooo-kay.
AID00145946	Fine, ignore me. Just don't ask me to re-attach your arm when your pet murder machine goes into "search and destroy" mode.
AID00145947	What's your problem with ED-E?
AID00145948	It just seems a little twitchy. Some of these robots, you look at them the wrong way, don't screw in a vacuum tube right...
AID00145949	The next thing you know you're a pile of ash on the floor and someone's stepping out of a vertibird to sweep your remains into a Nuka-Cola bottle.
AID00145950	I'd like you to come with me.
AID00145951	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
AID00145952	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
AID00145953	A courier, a doctor, and cybernetic dog. After we deal with this whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
AID00145954	There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
AID00145955	I'm just saying that if it were to fall into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
AID00145956	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
AID00145957	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
AID00145958	Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I do.
AID00145959	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
AID00145960	I need you to leave.
AID00145961	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
AID00145962	All right, I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
AID00145963	Ugh. I guess that means I have to go back to that creepy mausoleum Mr. House calls the Lucky 38.
AID00145964	I've been around a few unsettling places in my life, but that place takes the cake.
AID00145965	Anyway, if you need me, you know where to find me.
AID00145966	Back to the tomb, I suppose.
AID00145967	If you need me, et cetera.
AID00145968	Goodbye.
AID00145969	What's your opinion on the current situation?
AID00145970	You're helping the Legion, a slaving army that will almost certainly kill and enslave the majority of people in New Vegas.
AID00145971	What? Did you expect me to applaud your efforts to support a deranged warlord?
AID00145972	Caesar is bad. You are bad for helping him. Please stop.
AID00145973	I have to say I don't understand where you're going with Mr. House. The man's been manipulating the locals for as long as anyone can remember.
AID00145974	If you help him kick the NCR and Legion out, he's going to keep right on doing it. The people in Freeside will be just as bad off as they ever were.
AID00145975	If you can find a way to push Mr. House out of the picture as well, I think everyone will be better off.
AID00145976	Helping the NCR is better than helping Mr. House, but I don't think it's the best solution for the people in New Vegas.
AID00145977	If the NCR can take full control of Freeside and the Strip, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
AID00145978	Besides, even if New Vegas eventually gets representation in the NCR senate, it's not like the NCR runs efficiently.
AID00145979	I think you're on the right track.
AID00145980	The only way to ensure relative safety and independence for the people of New Vegas is to prevent others from taking control of the region.
AID00145981	That means no NCR, no Mr. House, and no Legion.
AID00145982	It could be better. If we can find a way to work toward the independence of New Vegas, that would be ideal.
AID00145983	But really, as long as you don't help out the Legion, anything's better than that.
AID00145984	Tell me about yourself.
AID00145985	I'm really very boring. You'd get better stories out of a Freeside junkie.
AID00145986	I'm not interested.
AID00145987	Oh. After spilling my guts to you, I wasn't expecting that kind of a response but... I understand.
AID00145988	If you change your mind, let me know. It would mean a lot to me.
AID00145989	Say no more. I'll do it.
AID00145990	Great! I'd like you to talk to the old-timers, the Remnants. I don't think I can convince them by myself. To them, I'm still a kid.
AID00145991	But you're a big part of what's happening out here. When you talk to them, they'll understand how important this all is.
AID00145992	I've kept in contact with them over the years, so I know where you can find them, but I doubt they'll open up to you unless I come along.
AID00145993	I know I'm not always the most serious guy around, but this means a lot to me. Thanks.
AID00145994	Do you want them to help NCR?
AID00145995	That's a hard question to answer. I know I don't want the Legion to take Hoover Dam.
AID00145996	So militarily, yes, I want them to help NCR. If possible, I'd like to figure out a way to help the NCR win Hoover Dam without holding New Vegas.
AID00145997	Where are you going with all this?
AID00145998	The Enclave did a lot of bad things, but there were good people at Navarro. Good people with a lot of experience.
AID00145999	Not many of them are alive anymore, but I think they could make a difference in the fight against Caesar.
AID00146000	What happened to Navarro?
AID00146001	After the Enclave's command structure fell apart, it was only a matter of time before Navarro was overrun by NCR forces.
AID00146002	My mother and I left with some of the troopers from my father's old unit, the same people I've kept in contact with over the years.
AID00146003	Anyone who didn't get out was killed by the NCR. Even some of the ones who escaped were eventually hunted down by the Brotherhood of Steel.
AID00146004	Where did the Enclave go?
AID00146005	A lot of different places. I only know what I was told. Some of them were cut down by the NCR and the Brotherhood. Some of them went east.
AID00146006	My mother never told me what happened to my father, but she and I went south with some others and integrated into the NCR.
AID00146007	When the NCR learned that Enclave personnel had integrated, we kept moving to the fringes. It's one of the reasons why I wound up out here.
AID00146008	I'm sure. I'm not interested.
AID00146009	Okay, I hear you. Forget I said anything. Consider it dropped.
AID00146010	All right, let me hear it.
AID00146011	Arcade, I'm not interested.
AID00146012	Are you sure? I didn't even get to the ostensibly "good" part.
AID00146013	If you're sure, I won't bring it up again. We can just go on our merry way, fighting injustice in our typical fashion.
AID00146014	What are you talking about?
AID00146015	I wasn't always with the Followers, or with the NCR.
AID00146016	My late father was an officer in a group called the Enclave, a remnant of America's Pre-War government.
AID00146017	Memories being short around here, not a whole lot of people remember them. But they did bad things. Terrorized communities, kidnapped people.
AID00146018	Eventually, someone stopped them. I was born a few years later at a military base on the coast, a place called Navarro.
AID00146019	Not right now, Arcade.
AID00146020	Actually, I'm going to keep talking anyway. Sorry, but I really need to get this out.
AID00146021	Sure.
AID00146022	Any day now, Caesar's going to try to march across Hoover Dam and kick NCR out of the Mojave.
AID00146023	We're getting caught up in something important out here. Hell, after how you handled Benny, you're practically right in the middle of all this.
AID00146024	I know I'm just along for the ride, but it's made me think about the past, how I might be able to help out.
AID00146025	If you don't like it, leave.
AID00146026	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as King Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
AID00146027	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as Queen Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
AID00146028	They profit from crime, now I profit, too.
AID00146029	That's one way to look at it.
AID00146030	It's just like other armor, but heavy, right?
AID00146031	Not even close. Power armor isn't something you wear so much as use. It's a weapon in its own right, and takes skill to wield.
AID00146032	If you don't know what you're doing, you won't even be able to walk with it on. So how about a bit of quick instruction?
AID00146033	I'd appreciate a lesson.
AID00146034	Here, I'll show you. It's easy, once you get used to it. First, we'll start with putting it on...
AID00146035	Actually, I already know how to use power armor.
AID00146036	Do you now? If I didn't already owe you a great deal I'd be highly suspicious right now. You'll have to tell me about it sometime.
AID00146037	HardinPowerArmorTraining
AID00146038	...There, I think you've got the hang of it now. You should be able to use any type of power armor you come across using what you just learned.
AID00146039	Very well, then. In addition to the armor, I've given the order that all of our arms and equipment be made available for your purchase.
AID00146040	Finally, while you are now a member of the Brotherhood, I cannot ask any more of you. I'm sure you have goals of your own outside these walls.
AID00146041	You are free to come and go as you please, though I hope you'll return to us someday in a more permanent capacity.
AID00146042	I wish you the best, outsid- Brother.
AID00146043	HVHardinPowerArmorTraining
AID00146044	I've taken care of the Van Graffs.
AID00146045	Well done. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's damn good to move forward again. Now, I believe congratulations are in order.
AID00146046	It is my honor to bestow up on you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for your meritorious service in its name.
AID00146047	Normally, there'd be a ceremony and such, but everyone is too busy at the moment for such frivolity.
AID00146048	I can give you this, however. Your very own suit of power armor. We can't spare our best, but I had the knights assemble this one for your use.
AID00146049	Which reminds me, you don't even know how to use these, do you?
AID00146050	On second thought, I'm fine not joining the Brotherhood.
AID00146051	Hmph, I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that. The Brotherhood could use someone with your skills.
AID00146052	In any case, was there something else you wanted?
AID00146053	Now you're just wasting my time. When you make up your mind, let me know.
AID00146054	Tell me what the task is before I agree to anything.
AID00146055	Is that a waver of resolve I sense? The Brotherhood is not in the habit of taking on the timid.
AID00146056	Yes, what is the task?
AID00146057	Back when we were stationed at HELIOS, our scouts reported that a group was establishing itself in the area as a distributor of Pre-War weapons.
AID00146058	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, was too concerned with getting HELIOS running and fending off the NCR, so he ordered us to leave them alone.
AID00146059	It's time that we correct that oversight, and show this region that the Brotherhood is still a force to be reckoned with.
AID00146060	I want you to visit these weapons dealers, this Van Graff family, and make an example of them. Leave no one alive.
AID00146061	When the job is done, report back and I'll arrange for a team to clean up the site and retrieve the weapons.
AID00146062	
AID00146063	Yes, I thought you might, given how much time you've spent here.
AID00146064	That's not usually a request we agree to. Typically, we take in the young, so that they might be trained through adolescence.
AID00146065	In special cases, we allow exceptional individuals to conditionally join. Luckily for you, you happen to be exceptional.
AID00146066	The condition is that you must complete a task. This task must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have what it takes to join the Brotherhood.
AID00146067	I happen to have something perfectly suitable in mind, though I warn you - it won't be easy. Still interested?
AID00146068	I want to join the Brotherhood.
AID00146069	Had second thoughts, did you? We've made some progress since the lockdown was lifted, but the task I had in mind is still available if you want it.
AID00146070	I wanted to ask about joining the Brotherhood again.
AID00146071	About my reward...
AID00146072	While I can't dispute that you've earned our gratitude, I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. Such a change takes time.
AID00146073	Stop back in a few days, and we can speak of this again. Now, I must be off. There is much to do!
AID00146074	Is there anything else for me to do?
AID00146075	No, your role in this is done. The rest is up to us. There is much for me to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.
AID00146076	Come back in a few days, and I should be firmly installed as Elder.
AID00146077	So what happens now?
AID00146078	There are a number of people I'll need to talk to. The process won't be instantaneous, but with this evidence, my path is clear.
AID00146079	It shouldn't take more than a few days, and then we can begin moving forward again.
AID00146080	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold you.
AID00146081	Predecessor's records indicate matching item purchased by nervous man wearing metal collar.
AID00146082	Records indicate man requested free lodging and was directed to concrete building in Freeside. Transmitting coordinates.
AID00146083	What kind of prototype were they making?
AID00146084	How do you know so much about this, again?
AID00146085	Stop thinking so much. Thanks.
AID00146086	Rockets and energy weapons? That's an odd combination.
AID00146087	McNamaraPowerArmorTraining
AID00146088	...There, I think you've got the knack of it now. You should now be able to wear any kind of power armor you come across.
AID00146089	I've also given the order that all of our equipment be made available to you, not just the more mundane arms.
AID00146090	You're a member of the Brotherhood now, and your gear should reflect that.
AID00146091	Lastly, you will be allowed to come and go as you please. You've done so much for us that to do otherwise would be a crime.
AID00146092	I just ask that you keep the Brotherhood's interests at heart in all your dealings. Remember that you will always have a home here.
AID00146093	Don't I just put it on?
AID00146094	If only it were that simple. Think of power armor as a machine to be operated rather than clothing you'd wear.
AID00146095	With a little instruction, using it becomes as natural as simple movement, but to the ignorant, it's just so much heavy junk.
AID00146096	So let's bring you up to speed, shall we?
AID00146097	Please do.
AID00146098	First, let's go over how to put it on...
AID00146099	I already know how to use power armor.
AID00146100	Would you like to tell me where you learned such a thing?
AID00146101	No, don't bother. A person as well-traveled as yourself is bound to pick up all kinds of skills, I suppose. Luckily, that's not all I have for you.
AID00146102	I installed the device up at Black Mountain, as instructed.
AID00146103	Yes, we've already started receiving telemetry from it. This will be a great help in our future efforts, and I thank you.
AID00146104	Now then, it is my great honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for meritorious service above and beyond the call of duty.
AID00146105	I'm afraid a formal ceremony was out of the question given our current state, but I hope this will make up for it.
AID00146106	I had the knights refurbish a suit of our power armor for your use. It's one of the earlier models, but it should serve you well.
AID00146107	Now, I suppose I'm going to have to show you how to use it, aren't I?
AID00146108	On second thought, I'm not really interested in joining the Brotherhood at the moment.
AID00146109	Regrettable, but understandable. Should you change your mind, return here. I will hold off on assigning the task to my brethren, for now.
AID00146110	That depends on the task.
AID00146111	Do not hesitate, my friend. Learn from my mistake and go boldly, one way or the other.
AID00146112	Yes, what is the task?
AID00146113	As one of our patrols discovered, the mutants just to the northeast have become strangely violent in the years we were secluded.
AID00146114	However, this turn of events could also be an opportunity. We mostly left the equipment of the communications array there alone, out of respect.
AID00146115	As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will accorded them. Making their equipment fair game.
AID00146116	I want you to head up to the summit of Black Mountain and install this remote signal transmitter in one of their consoles.
AID00146117	It will allow us to tap into the radar and other detection systems running there, assuming they're still operational.
AID00146118	If we're going to operate on the surface again, it would be nice to do so with as much information at our fingertips as possible. Good luck.
AID00146119	
AID00146120	You've certainly earned the right, but I'm afraid there's a slight matter of protocol that must be dealt with first.
AID00146121	Exceptional individuals, like yourself, are sometimes allowed to join the Brotherhood if they perform a valuable service for it.
AID00146122	While your actions up to this point have been commendable, I'm afraid they don't quite qualify as such a service.
AID00146123	However, I do have another task that fits the bill rather nicely. Would you consider undertaking it?
AID00146124	I want to join the Brotherhood.
AID00146125	The task I had in mind is still available, if you're up for it.
AID00146126	Can I still join the Brotherhood?
AID00146127	Never mind.
AID00146128	Female, Evil Karma.
AID00146129	Female, Evil Karma.
AID00146130	Female, Neutral Karma.
AID00146131	Female, Neutral Karma.
AID00146132	Female, Good Karma.
AID00146133	Female, Good Karma.
AID00146134	Male, Evil Karma.
AID00146135	Male, Evil Karma.
AID00146136	Male, Neutral Karma.
AID00146137	Male, Neutral Karma.
AID00146138	Male, Good Karma.
AID00146139	Male, Good Karma.
AID00146140	I'll be going now.
AID00146141	Watch yourself.
AID00146142	Any work around here?
AID00146143	Nothing I know of, but if you've come from the North, means you can travel freer than most around here.
AID00146144	Might check the Barracks, someone might need you to hoof it somewhere. Just be careful if you go up on the roof - got a sniper watching the road.
AID00146145	If you're gear's in need of repair, HQ's also worth checking out - talk to Major Knight, he can help. Provided you got a pen and plenty of ink.
AID00146146	What are those statues of?
AID00146147	Those two? Represents unification. Mostly good for shade. Won't do much else when the Legion reaches us.
AID00146148	What is this place?
AID00146149	Outpost, Mojave Outpost. Watching a lot of nothing, feels like a big Brahmin pen for caravans.
AID00146150	They've been stopped for a while, waiting for the roads North to clear - or their clearance papers to go through.
AID00146151	Look like you've walked a ways, so if you need to shake the dust off, head to the Barracks, the bar's there. Not much, but better than nothing.
AID00146152	Tell me about the battle at HELIOS.
AID00146153	HELIOS was the worst goddamned action I've seen in a long, long career of fighting.
AID00146154	Tell me about your last Elder.
AID00146155	Elijah was a strange one. His even becoming Elder was highly questionable, seeing as how he was a Scribe. Typically, only Paladins are eligible.
AID00146156	But an exception was made in his case, on account of him being a genius. Unfortunately, whatever scientific acumen he had didn't extend to tactics.
AID00146157	Trying to defend HELIOS was a blunder of the worst kind, and many brothers lost their lives because of it.
AID00146158	Many of the senior paladins, myself included, advised him to fight a retreating action, but he refused to budge. Said he almost "had it working".
AID00146159	We never did find out exactly what he was talking about. When the perimeter was finally overrun, the Elder had simply vanished.
AID00146160	What would you do if you became Elder?
AID00146161	After lifting the lockdown, the first thing I'd do is send scouts out to recon the area. We need to know what's going on out there.
AID00146162	Next, I'd resume patrols in the near vicinity, and begin sending search teams out to the spots the scouts reported were relatively safe.
AID00146163	It's standard procedure when a chapter relocates to an area, but standard procedure wasn't our last Elder's style, either.
AID00146164	Why do you dislike McNamara so much?
AID00146165	It's not that I dislike the Elder, but I strongly disapprove of his current style of leadership. We're safe, yes, but at what cost?
AID00146166	What do you think of the lockdown?
AID00146167	It's a travesty, is what it is. Every second we sit on our hands down here is another second that we're not fulfilling our sworn duty.
AID00146168	
AID00146169	Yes, I've always known they were. Luckily, they don't know exactly where we are. And even if they did, our position here is fortified.
AID00146170	And assuming they managed to breach the bunker, I would be forced to activate our failsafe system.
AID00146171	Better we all die than allow the technology we have here to fall into such unworthy hands.
AID00146172	The NCR is currently looking to destroy you.
AID00146173	I suppose it was only a matter of time. I wonder if, given the NCR's current situation, they would consider a truce of sorts?
AID00146174	We've given up our claim to HELIOS, and we don't have any interest in claiming Hoover Dam, so our ambitions are not at crossed purposes.
AID00146175	Perhaps it's time for a new strategy. Go to the NCR commander and tell her the Brotherhood is willing to put aside our enmity for the time being.
AID00146176	Further, tell her that we are willing to send troops to aid in their coming defense of the Dam. My guess is they're in no position to refuse.
AID00146177	The NCR is currently looking to destroy you.
AID00146178	Did you know Hardin is trying to find a way to become Elder?
AID00146179	Oh yes, he's been trying for quite some time. Hardin has been strongly opposed to the lockdown from the first. It goes against his nature, you see.
AID00146180	Hardin's the type to fight to the last, and die rather than surrender. It's a good trait to have in a soldier, and a bad one to have in a leader.
AID00146181	Don't let his actions bother you. He's only doing what he thinks is best for the chapter.
AID00146182	Tell me about what happened at HELIOS.
AID00146183	We were overrun, plain and simple. My Brothers fought with great courage, but in the end the enemy was just too many.
AID00146184	When the tide of the battle turned for the worse, our Elder was nowhere to be found, and everything was chaos.
AID00146185	Fully half of our forces had already fallen. I gathered up those I could find and we fought our way here.
AID00146186	This place had been briefly discussed as a fallback point, though at the time none really believed that could possibly become necessary.
AID00146187	That's it, really. There was nothing glorious about the battle, just a nightmare of screams, blood, and death.
AID00146188	What is with that crazy sandstorm on the surface?
AID00146189	That is this base's defensive system. It serves as camouflage and masks all entry and exit from the bunker.
AID00146190	We use it to hide our patrols and supply runners, though we still send such out at night to be extra safe.
AID00146191	Let's talk about something else.
AID00146192	All right. What did you wish to speak about?
AID00146193	How do you get supplies?
AID00146194	We have some personnel that are allowed to travel on the surface. They trade for what we need, and occasionally drop off what they acquire.
AID00146195	We make sure that they only enter or leave the bunker while the sandstorm is active, to avoid detection.
AID00146196	Tell me about the lockdown.
AID00146197	It's a protective measure that was enacted after our defeat at HELIOS. The NCR was hot on our heels, and we wouldn't have survived another encounter.
AID00146198	It was decided that we would stay quiet for a time, heal the wounded, and try to come up with a new strategy.
AID00146199	However, after we had fully recuperated, our first scouting measures showed that the NCR's presence in this region had only increased in our absence.
AID00146200	There are now more than five times the number of NCR troops in the area as when we fought them, and we have half the number we did at HELIOS.
AID00146201	And so the lockdown has been extended. To go outside would be the death of us all.
AID00146202	I must prepare myself before I go.
AID00146203	Then be quick about it.
AID00146204	It will be an honor to fight for the Legion.
AID00146205	Good. "In hoc signo taurus vinces."
AID00146206	Report to Legatus Lanius immediately - he'll brief you on the plan of battle. Come back victorious, or don't come back.
AID00146207	Fine. Get lost.
AID00146208	That was the plan. Bye.
AID00146209	Why?
AID00146210	Because you're helping Caesar's Legion. They are bad. You are bad. I am going. Bye.
AID00146211	Why are you crazy? That's a question for someone much wiser and more patient than myself.
AID00146212	All I know is that you are a bad person and I don't want to be around you anymore. So if that was your goal, congratulations.
AID00146213	If not, I'm sorry to inform you that you are, as the locals say, "nuttier than a Bighorner dropping."
AID00146214	If you have a problem with me, why don't you just leave right now?
AID00146215	If you insist. Have a nice life.
AID00146216	Whatever.
AID00146217	That wasn't exactly the response I was hoping for, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
AID00146218	Seriously, though, watch it.
AID00146219	Sorry. I just lose my head sometimes.
AID00146220	If by "sometimes" you mean "a lot of times," I agree. Please, just... settle down, okay?
AID00146221	They hide behind NCR's protection and they deserve everything coming to them.
AID00146222	They sure don't, but I hope you get everything that's coming to you.
AID00146223	Have a nice life.
AID00146224	That's a good way to put it.
AID00146225	Sure, if you're a sociopath.
AID00146226	Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
AID00146227	More than collateral damage. A necessary sacrifice.
AID00146228	How noble of you.
AID00146229	Sorry, but I won't be sticking around to see if you have the courtesy to lay flowers on the mass grave that the Legion's going to dig for them.
AID00146230	Actually, yes, I would like to see New Vegas turned into a slavery hub.
AID00146231	Great! You're either unimaginably cruel or profoundly insane!
AID00146232	Either way, I'm not going to wait around for you to help the Legion roll across Hoover Dam. Bye.
AID00146233	The Legion is better than the alternative.
AID00146234	What?! Caesar is going to enslave or kill everyone in the Mojave.
AID00146235	And when that's done, he'll try to destroy the NCR senate and install himself as its new military dictator.
AID00146236	I can't comprehend how Caesar could so extensively scramble your sense of morality to make you think the Legion is a better alternative to anything.
AID00146237	And you know what? I'm not going to stick around to try to figure it out. At least legionaries have the excuse of being born into it.
AID00146238	Have a nice life.
AID00146239	NCR is broken beyond repair. Its time has come.
AID00146240	If the NCR is broken, it will fail on its own.
AID00146241	The people who live here don't deserve to be victims of your misguided attempts at political engineering.
AID00146242	Or are they just collateral damage?
AID00146243	Yes, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.
AID00146244	Okay. I just wanted you to confirm that I'm traveling in the company of an insane fascist. Thanks.
AID00146245	I'm just trying to be open-minded.
AID00146246	It's a good thing to be, but you may want to close the floodgates once you see how Caesar runs things.
AID00146247	With how messed up New Vegas is, do you really think Caesar has nothing to offer?
AID00146248	At least the mess is ours to clean up.
AID00146249	Wait a minute... am I going crazy or are you actually suggesting it might not be bad if the Legion takes over?
AID00146250	Enjoying your stay?
AID00146251	In the words of Socrates, "Go fornicate yourself."
AID00146252	The world needs Caesar more than it needs you.
AID00146253	Victrix causa deis placuit sed victa Catoni.
AID00146254	Goodbye, courier.
AID00146255	I thought you were interested in preserving life.
AID00146256	I know I shouldn't place one life below another, but in Caesar's case, I'll make an exception.
AID00146257	The whole "slavery and cultural annihilation" stance he's adopted is bit repugnant to me.
AID00146258	Though I guess what I think never really mattered much to you, did it?
AID00146259	But in the end, doesn't it all just come down to numbers anyway?
AID00146260	If you lose your humanity, then I suppose that is all that's left.
AID00146261	I'm sure he means well.
AID00146262	It isn't enough to mean well if you don't do good. I'm sure Caesar meant well, too.
AID00146263	Good thing there are still people like you around.
AID00146264	Kind of you to say, but there are better people than me around here. I just hope the Followers can make a difference in the long run.

AID00146307	Nothing, man.
AID00146308	Just hanging out. Same as usual.
AID00146309	I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
AID00146310	I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
AID00146311	Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
AID00146312	Goodbye.
AID00146313	Stay safe.
AID00146314	I'd like to see your wares.
AID00146315	Sure. Here's what I've got.
AID00146316	VES08TakeWater03
AID00146317	Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
AID00146318	VES08TakeWater02
AID00146319	Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
AID00146320	VES08TakeWater01
AID00146321	Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
AID00146322	VES08LeaveWater03
AID00146323	Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
AID00146324	VES08LeaveWater02
AID00146325	You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
AID00146326	VES08LeaveWater01
AID00146327	Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
AID00146328	I could use some help with my gear.
AID00146329	Let me sign off on the work order for you, then.
AID00146330	Scared of something?
AID00146331	So is that a "no," you don't want to be friends, or...
AID00146332	I... would, perhaps some other time. When my orders take me to Vegas, perhaps. Wish things were different, but might take some time.
AID00146333	Forget it, then, you're a waste of time.
AID00146334	Wait... wait a minute. Look. Some things in the NCR are... aren't ideal. But I want to help.
AID00146335	If you need something repaired... let me know, I can sign the work order. As long as caps change hands, I can put them back in yours.
AID00146336	Didn't realize NCR was so spineless.
AID00146337	Now wait a minute - Republic's a sight better than... other alternatives. Women are serving here, after all. The rest... well, might take some time.
AID00146338	And they're more accepting back West, like I said. In the meantime...
AID00146339	Something wrong with asking your name?
AID00146340	What do you mean?
AID00146341	This isn't the Republic. Oddly enough, Legion's a little more forgiving about... friendships. Out here, it's not as accepted.
AID00146342	Not that I mind being friends, it's just being open about it in the Outpost... well, I have to work here.
AID00146343	[Confirmed Bachelor] You didn't tell me your name.
AID00146344	Oh - Knight. You must not be from around here. If so... it doesn't do to get too friendly.
AID00146345	Courier.
AID00146346	[NCR] NCR Soldier.
AID00146347	Reinforcements? About time we got some more hands around here.
AID00146348	Uh, citizen, I guess.
AID00146349	What?
AID00146350	Just need something for the log book, keeping tabs on traffic through the Outpost... although mostly just in, not out these days.
AID00146351	If you're looking for the commanding officer, he's in the back. Although... he's got a lot on his plate, so if you speak with him... keep it short.
AID00146352	Also, you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
AID00146353	Never mind, I'll be going now.
AID00146354	Fine, then.
AID00146355	Any work around here?
AID00146356	Work around here? Might check with Jackson in the main building. Or Ghost up on the roof above, but watch out, she's... well, she's kind of a bitch.
AID00146357	Don't tell her I said that, though. Might take a bullet some night when I'm going to the latrine.
AID00146358	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
AID00146359	Not too much, lot of caravans going nowhere. Lot of troopers going nowhere, too.
AID00146360	Few prospectors here and there, but... they don't do more than stink up the place.
AID00146361	Everybody's backed up here. You think it'd be good for business, but most of the traders are tight with the caps, even the larger caravan outfits.
AID00146362	Up for some more Caravan?
AID00146363	All right, go on - let's put our cards down.
AID00146364	I was hoping to pass the time with a game or two.
AID00146365	What, Caravan? All right, I'll give it a go. Haven't exactly got much of a line of folks to serve.
AID00146366	What do you have for trade?
AID00146367	Take a look.
AID00146368	For you? I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
AID00146369	Let's get going.
AID00146370	Hold on a second. I need to talk to you about something else.
AID00146371	You've certainly done your part.
AID00146372	I've been wondering about Daisy and the others for so long, I still haven't figured out what I should do.
AID00146373	I mean, I'm not like them. I was born at Navarro and my father served with them, but I wasn't really part of the Enclave.
AID00146374	It seems presumptuous of me to think that I could join the fight, even if this is a cause worth fighting for.
AID00146375	Because I know when fighting breaks out at the dam, all hell is going to break loose in Freeside. They're going to need every doctor they can get.
AID00146376	That's their story Arcade, not yours.
AID00146377	Oh, I know. I was only a boy when they went through hell together. I'm glad you're helping me reunite them.
AID00146378	Even if I'm still just a spectator in all of this, I know they can still do some good.
AID00146379	They're loyal to you, too.
AID00146380	Sometimes I wonder how much of my father they see in me. They went through a lot together, but my family went through it, too.
AID00146381	I'm glad they've watched out for me all these years. Maybe someday I can return the favor.
AID00146382	It seems pointless to do all of that without a goal.
AID00146383	I'm sure Henry has goals. He was just more concerned with the "how" than the "why" of things. Being in the Enclave didn't really mean much to him.
AID00146384	I guess I'm lucky that I'm part of the Followers. Helping people as a doctor is important, but with the Followers, it feels different.
AID00146385	It feels like we're working toward something more important. That's more than the sum of good deeds that we do.
AID00146386	His work was what mattered to him.
AID00146387	Not everyone dreams of being a revolutionary, I suppose. Maybe we can't all change the world.
AID00146388	Maybe it's enough just to do good for the short time that we're here. No one's going to sing Doc Henry's praises when he's gone.
AID00146389	But he's probably saved more lives than I ever will.
AID00146390	Why worry about it? You don't have to be your father.
AID00146391	I grew up without him. I'll always feel like something is missing from my life. But you're right.
AID00146392	It's not like I'm the only kid in the wasteland who's grown up without a dad. Johnson always said my father was a good man.
AID00146393	If that's the only thing about me that's like him, that's enough for me.
AID00146394	I'm sure your father would be proud of you.
AID00146395	I wonder if he would. It's pointless, I know, but sometimes I wonder what he wanted me to be.
AID00146396	Maybe being a doctor in the middle of Nevada wasn't exactly what he had in mind for his little boy.
AID00146397	Some people can't stop reliving their glory days.
AID00146398	Not much glory in the Enclave. Most of her old comrades are long gone.
AID00146399	I know life as a salvager can't compare to being a vertibird pilot but... at least it's life. That has to count for something.
AID00146400	It was an important part of her life. Why shouldn't she enjoy it?
AID00146401	As screwed up as it sounds, at least she was part of something. Granted, it was something... admittedly, pretty bad, but it was something.
AID00146402	If you spent the first half of your life flying Enclave troopers in a vertibird, I suppose picking over Pre-War rocket parts doesn't quite compare.
AID00146403	A man should know when to let go.
AID00146404	It's been decades, you know. By now, he's been out of the Enclave longer than he was in.
AID00146405	Most people know when to hang it up and start over. But not Moreno.
AID00146406	Don't be too hard on him. It's part of who he is.
AID00146407	I suppose you're right. When you're part of something for that long, maybe it's impossible to let go without losing part of yourself.
AID00146408	Moreno may be a stubborn son of a bitch, but at least he's loyal.
AID00146409	[Medicine responses]
AID00146410	[SUCCEEDED] Never this... bad before.
AID00146411	Is this the first time you've experienced sudden onset headaches?
AID00146412	[FAILED] What's it look like, you asshole?
AID00146413	Does your head hurt?
AID00146414	You were saying?
AID00146415	Are you all right?
AID00146416	Fuck this, I'm going to lie down!
AID00146417	Come back later - tomorrow!
AID00146418	What is that machine in your tent?
AID00146419	It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
AID00146420	It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
AID00146421	Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
AID00146422	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow07
AID00146423	Damn! And he looks good to me, too.
AID00146424	Damn! And she looks good to me, too.
AID00146425	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow06
AID00146426	Check that out! He just left the Lucky 38!
AID00146427	Check that out! She just left the Lucky 38!
AID00146428	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow05
AID00146429	That one must be important around here!
AID00146430	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow04
AID00146431	Wow... that's crazy.
AID00146432	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow03
AID00146433	I thought nobody has ever been inside that place.
AID00146434	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow02
AID00146435	What? are you serious? I've got to see that!
AID00146436	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow01
AID00146437	Hey... Look! Someone's coming out of the 38!
AID00146438	I'll see what I can find out.
AID00146439	Do that. And try not to take too long.
AID00146440	There may be another solution.
AID00146441	And what would that be?
AID00146442	I'll leave at once.
AID00146443	Vale.
AID00146444	Where would I find a diagnostic scanning module?
AID00146445	It's been said that Auto-Docs were standard equipment in the underground Vaults where mankind survived when the bombs fell centuries ago.
AID00146446	You can search the Vaults, but every Auto-Doc my Legion has run across has been stripped for parts long before we found it.
AID00146447	Some of my scouts did report an abandoned Vault near Nellis Air Force Base. Overrun by ghouls, they said.
AID00146448	Maybe the infestation has been there long enough to keep scavengers out. Why don't you go and see?
AID00146449	I'll bring him to you.
AID00146450	All right. Just leave him outside the tent when you return. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
AID00146451	Be on your way, then. And try not to take too long.
AID00146452	He's standing right outside your tent.
AID00146453	I'll have my guards take him captive. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
AID00146454	One of my companions, Arcade, has medical expertise. You could take him as a slave.
AID00146455	And where is this Arcade?
AID00146456	What about the Auto-Doc in your tent?
AID00146457	It's never had a functional diagnostic scanning module. Without that, it's useless for surgery.
AID00146458	[Speech Check 65+]
AID00146459	[SUCCEEDED] Then go find some proper Surgical Tools. The medications from a Doctor's Bag might come in handy, too.
AID00146460	I'll make sure you're allowed to bring the necessary medications into the camp.  Hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
AID00146461	It's a simple procedure... as brain surgeries go.
AID00146462	[FAILED] If you think this is funny, you should give crucifixion a try. Now that's hilarious.
AID00146463	If you can't help me, who can?
AID00146464	I'll need a vise... or a large nutcracker...
AID00146465	[Medicine Check 75+]
AID00146466	[SUCCEEDED] Then gather those items together and hurry back to perform the operation. I don't know how long I've got.
AID00146467	I can perform the surgery, but I'll need proper tools and supplies from a Doctor's Bag.
AID00146468	[FAILED] Then gather the tools you need, and study up on your medical skills.
AID00146469	When you're confident you can perform the operation, hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
AID00146470	Even with proper Surgical Tools, an operation of this sort might be beyond me.
AID00146471	[Speech Check.]
AID00146472	[SUCCEEDED] I'm not familiar with that condition. Is it treatable?
AID00146473	Straight-forward case of intra-cranial blastoma fibrolosis, I wager.
AID00146474	[FAILED] There's nothing "moderate" about the severity of this. And if you're going to make up names for diseases, come up with good ones.
AID00146475	If you can't help me, who can?
AID00146476	Sounds like a moderately severe case of Skullatosis.
AID00146477	[Medicine Check]
AID00146478	[SUCCEEDED] I figured as much.
AID00146479	Congratulations, you just became my personal physician. Do you have what you need to treat my condition?
AID00146480	I'm afraid your symptoms are consistent with a brain lesion, most likely a tumor.
AID00146481	[FAILED] Yeah, it does. So if you can't help me, who can?
AID00146482	I don't know. Sounds serious, though.
AID00146483	Seriously, let's talk about your health.
AID00146484	I said, take care of the Brotherhood. Then we talk - maybe.
AID00146485	I think we should talk about your health.
AID00146486	Take care of the Brotherhood. Maybe then we can have a conversation.
AID00146487	[Medicine option]
AID00146488	[SUCCEEDED] Don't... just leave it alone. I'm fine. Now what was I saying...? Right.
AID00146489	I'm concerned you may have a serious neurological condition.
AID00146490	Where do I find the Brotherhood? How do I destroy them?
AID00146491	Look for the Brotherhood's bunker around, uh... Hidden Valley. My scouts... saw some things.
AID00146492	I'm going to bed. We'll talk later.
AID00146493	You just blanked out for several seconds.
AID00146494	It's nothing. Just tired, that's all.
AID00146495	[Medicine options]
AID00146496	[SUCCEEDED] I don't know... There have been a couple...
AID00146497	You just experienced an Absence Seizure. Was this the first time?
AID00146498	[FAILED] I'm... I'm not sure. What was I saying? That's right, the Brotherhood...
AID00146499	What were you daydreaming about?
AID00146500	Hello! We were talking?
AID00146501	Are you okay?
AID00146502	Hmm...
AID00146503	Huh... Yeah. Yeah.
AID00146504	Yeah, the Brotherhood. Them.
AID00146505	[Medicine options!!!]
AID00146506	[SUCCEEDED] I appreciate your concern, but I'm in excellent health. And we have other matters to discuss.
AID00146507	I'm concerned your headaches might be symptoms of a more serious condition.
AID00146508	[FAILED] Only when you're around.
AID00146509	Do you get headaches a lot?
AID00146510	Yes, you said I should forge an alliance between the White Gloves and your Legion.
AID00146511	What about the White Glove Society?
AID00146512	I was saying that I'd planned to ask you to forge an alliance with them, but you killed their leaders.
AID00146513	By the time the White Gloves sort themselves out, the battle for Hoover Dam will have come and gone. So, on to the next matter at hand...
AID00146514	The last time we met, your head seemed ready to explode.
AID00146515	I get headaches every once in a while. So what? Anyway, we have other matters to discuss.
AID00146516	What were you saying about the White Glove Society?
AID00146517	Disturb me again and I'll have you killed!
AID00146518	[Medicine responses]
AID00146519	[SUCCEEDED] A week, maybe two... it doesn't matter!
AID00146520	You're limping when you walk. How long has that been going on?

AID00146522	You don't look so good.
AID00146523	Sorry, I'll let you sleep.

AID00146526	Is this the first time you've experienced sudden onset headaches?
AID00146527	[FAILED] What's it look like, you asshole?
AID00146528	Does your head hurt?
AID00146529	You were saying?

AID00146546	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
AID00146547	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
AID00146548	Tell me about Caesar.
AID00146549	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AID00146550	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
AID00146551	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
AID00146552	Your "civilization" sounds like a pack of snarling dogs.
AID00146553	Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
AID00146554	How can I serve the Legion?
AID00146555	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
AID00146556	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
AID00146557	Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
AID00146558	That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
AID00146559	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
AID00146560	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
AID00146561	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00146562	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
AID00146563	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00146564	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
AID00146565	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
AID00146566	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00146567	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
AID00146568	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AID00146569	You slaughtered innocent civilians?
AID00146570	Innocent? Hardly.
AID00146571	Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
AID00146572	They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
AID00146573	They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
AID00146574	I've heard enough.
AID00146575	I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
AID00146576	Why, then, do you keep asking?
AID00146577	You captured everyone?
AID00146578	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
AID00146579	I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
AID00146580	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
AID00146581	What exactly happened here?
AID00146582	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
AID00146583	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers - or men of the Legion. The people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
AID00146584	For a pittance, the great Vulpes Inculta inveigled this town to lead those it had sheltered into a trap.
AID00146585	Only when it was sprung did they realize they were caught inside it, too. I only wish Vulpes had lived to see the scheme come to fruition.
AID00146586	Your crimes are unforgivable.
AID00146587	So you've said.
AID00146588	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
AID00146589	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
AID00146590	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
AID00146591	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
AID00146592	What "lessons" did you teach here?
AID00146593	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AID00146594	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AID00146595	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AID00146596	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AID00146597	I'll do as you ask.
AID00146598	Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
AID00146599	Who are you?
AID00146600	I am Gabban, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the one of his Frumentarii.
AID00146601	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
AID00146602	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
AID00146603	Legionaries - we have a problem!

AID00146610	Caesar's health worsens, and your indecision is unhelpful.
AID00146611	He's all yours.
AID00146612	It will be done.
AID00146613	I've brought a doctor, Arcade Gannon, who can take care of Caesar. He's outside.
AID00146614	Very well. I'll have him seized and brought to Caesar as his personal physician.
AID00146615	So shall I have him seized or not?
AID00146616	Got it.
AID00146617	Anything else I should know?
AID00146618	What else can you tell me about Little Buster?
AID00146619	Sounds like fun. I'll get on it.
AID00146620	Got it.
AID00146621	Lot of soldiers around - where's First Recon?
AID00146622	All right, got it.
AID00146623	I can handle the dogs. Where do I need to go?
AID00146624	You don't have to worry about House. I disconnected him from his system.
AID00146625	You don't have to worry about House. I already killed him.
AID00146626	I thought Mr. House already agreed to hand over New Vegas to the NCR.
AID00146627	Yes, that's what he wants us to believe. And when we turn our attention to other threats, he'll begin moving against us.
AID00146628	No, far safer to simply eliminate him and the risk he represents now. Besides, with him gone, New Vegas will truly be ours once the dust settles.
AID00146629	Any other objections or questions?
AID00146630	Do you know who he was? Where he went?
AID00146631	I'm still working on that, actually.
AID00146632	You had your chance. Now you die.
AID00146633	No, I haven't.
AID00146634	Then you die.
AID00146635	A man who can cure Caesar, Arcade Gannon, waits outside. He's all yours.
AID00146636	Good. I'll have my men seize him immediately.
AID00146637	I have what's needed to do the surgery.
AID00146638	Do it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
AID00146639	I've brought something to fix the Auto-Doc.
AID00146640	Fix it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
AID00146641	No trick, and I'm only trying to help.
AID00146642	We'll see.
AID00146643	Out of my way, Lucius.
AID00146644	Go.
AID00146645	I'll keep that in mind.

AID00146652	<Attack> If you won't surrender, then you'll die.
AID00146653	Singing isn't necessary, but I do have a paper for you to sign.
AID00146654	I have the terms of your surrender here for you.

AID00146656	"The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas..." What the hell does that mean?! Oh, wait, here we go.
AID00146657	"Demands NCR's immediate withdrawal..." Withdrawal? Like fucking hell we're withdrawing... we just held the dam, we didn't do it to let it go!

AID00146674	Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
AID00146675	Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.

AID00146784	Allowing Anderson to get away with murder tells him and everyone else that it's permissable.
AID00146785	There are other ways to punish people, other ways to condemn their actions.
AID00146786	It was either this or spend the rest of his life in an NCR chain gang.
AID00146787	That was his decision to make, not yours.
AID00146788	It's cleaner this way, without bringing NCR in. No connecting Anderson back to the locals.
AID00146789	That's a grim deal to make. But when it came down to it, it's the same choice he made. Not all sacrifices are made by the willing.
AID00146790	But where is the lamb for this burnt offering?
AID00146791	You're assuming a motive without evidence. Please be rational.

AID00146800	<Speech more money>
AID00146801	<Barter>
AID00146802	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
AID00146803	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AID00146804	This kind of work costs time and money.  50/50 would cover my expenses.
AID00146805	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AID00146806	Are you crazy?!  I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
AID00146807	What happens in Freeside won't make any difference if the Legion takes the dam. Fight with them.
AID00146808	Good point. You've been encouraging the others to stand up and fight, maybe I should take the same advice. After all, I also lived in Navarro.
AID00146809	There's something I need to go do, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks again for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
AID00146810	I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you had a problem with people who hold on to the past.
AID00146811	Suiting up to fight against Caesar with the Navarro veterans seems like... I don't know, like a kid playing dress up in his father's clothes.
AID00146812	If you're so sure it's going to be a bloodbath, maybe you should stay in Freeside.
AID00146813	I figured you'd say that. Sometimes staying put is the best thing you can do.
AID00146814	I'll leave the fighting to the old warhorses. It's what they were made for.
AID00146815	I need to go take care of something before I set up at Freeside. I'll see you soon. And again, thanks for your help with the others.
AID00146816	I honestly didn't expect you to say that. When I talked to you about Daisy and the others, you seemed to put a lot of value in loyalty to the past.
AID00146817	What's changed since then?
AID00146818	Time for the NCR to roast.
AID00146819	Oh, to hell with this!
AID00146820	I'm thinking I'm going to get a sweet Pre-War laser. What are you thinking?
AID00146821	I'm thinking that I'm leaving because you are a sociopath. Good riddance.
AID00146822	Oh, uh... whoops, I thought that was to turn it off.
AID00146823	Argh, you moron! You're going to kill all of the troopers down there!
AID00146824	That's it. I'm out. Good luck getting out of this place without being shot to pieces by NCR soldiers, assuming they aren't going to fry to death.
AID00146825	Er...
AID00146826	Yeah, exactly. They don't.
AID00146827	You can always use more power, right?
AID00146828	Maybe if you're Mr. House you do. I bet the people in Freeside need it a lot more than he does.
AID00146829	Redundancy. If Caesar takes the dam and cuts off power, it will be chaos all over New Vegas.
AID00146830	Hmm. That's a valid point. I'm not really behind the NCR in all of this, but the last thing I want is panic in the streets.
AID00146831	Noted.
AID00146832	O... kay.
AID00146833	Why not to the whole area equally?
AID00146834	NCR troops control Hoover Dam. Why do they need more power?
AID00146835	Of course.
AID00146836	Great. Glad we're on the same page.
AID00146837	I mean, I didn't expect that you'd want to... activate the super weapon or anything.
AID00146838	Heh.
AID00146839	Goodbye.
AID00146840	All right.
AID00146841	Let's talk about something else.
AID00146842	All right.
AID00146843	I'll say.
AID00146844	Okay, okay, you don't have to agree with me that much.
AID00146845	Why don't you like talking about yourself?
AID00146846	Some people do. I just... don't.
AID00146847	Look, I appreciate that you're trying to be friendly, but I'd just rather not discuss it.
AID00146848	Arcade, I'm asking you because I'm interested. Don't put yourself down.
AID00146849	Oh, all right. I'm thirty-ish. Well, late thirties. I was born... west of here. I was an only child and spent most of my time with my mother.
AID00146850	My father died when I was young and I never got over it. Oh... and I like medicine and reading books about failed Pre-War socioeconomic policies.
AID00146851	Right now, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "Why hasn't some lucky man scooped this bachelor off his feet?" Like I said, I'm boring.
AID00146852	You can do better than that.
AID00146853	No, really. Have you ever snorted a ground up Cazador venom sac? Neither have I, but I can guarantee you that a Freeside junkie has.
AID00146854	What will you do if Caesar wins?
AID00146855	What the Followers always do. Whatever we can.
AID00146856	What do you think the others will do at Hoover Dam?
AID00146857	I don't think you need to worry about the specifics. Basically, expect a lot of firepower and dead bodies.
AID00146858	Enclave technology is even more advanced than Brotherhood equipment, and in the hands of soldiers as experienced as Moreno and the others...
AID00146859	Let's just say it's truly a sight to behold.
AID00146860	I don't think either of us can fully understand what he and the tribes have gone through.
AID00146861	A fair point, but from the perspective of someone on the east side of Arizona, the man is clearly out of his mind.
AID00146862	Maybe he didn't intend for things to wind up this way, but that doesn't mean he needs to perpetuate this bizarre anachronistic myth.
AID00146863	And it doesn't mean that we should sit by and nod our heads at every absurd faux-Roman casus belli he can dream up.
AID00146864	He's a tyrant. The bad kind. And there's no way we're letting him take Hoover Dam.
AID00146865	He's a madman. What did you expect?
AID00146866	Well, yeah! Right. What did I expect? The man's a megalomaniac. He acts like this is some pre-ordained cycle we're returning to.
AID00146867	Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off of a cliff.
AID00146868	Instead of trying to learn from the past, he re-creates it, runs back over the same old barren ground.
AID00146869	He seemed pretty smart to me.
AID00146870	Being "smart" doesn't matter if you're insane. Everything makes sense to Caesar because he's twisted everything to his world view.
AID00146871	He's Caesar reincarnated, the NCR is the corrupt Roman senate. I wouldn't be surprised if he thought the Colorado River were the new Rubicon.
AID00146872	He abdicates responsibility to a myth of historical inevitability. But he's not Caesar. This isn't Rome. And he isn't going to get away with this.
AID00146873	Who, Caesar?
AID00146874	Of course, Caesar! You can hardly even hold his men responsible, given how they're practically raised to worship him as a living deity.
AID00146875	What's the point of surviving the war? Why did the founders of the Followers crawl their way out of vaults to bring knowledge back to the wasteland?
AID00146876	So we could act like the last two thousand years didn't happen? Play dress up so we can fight ancient wars all over again?
AID00146877	No way is he getting away with this. I'm not letting it happen. You're not letting it happen.
AID00146878	You're right. Freeside needs doctors. It needs you.
AID00146879	You're right. They'll need every ally they can get at the dam.
AID00146880	That was just talk. It's not the same for you.
AID00146881	No, I think it is the same for me. Maybe for a different reason, but... you can't hold on to a past you've never had.
AID00146882	For better or worse, I am not my father. I never had a life with the Enclave, and it would be silly for me to try to start one now.
AID00146883	I'll stay with you until the Legion moves on the dam, but once the attack starts, I'm going to have to go to back to Freeside. It's where I belong.
AID00146884	I need to take care of something, but I'll see you soon enough. Thanks for all of the help. It means a lot to me.
AID00146885	You aren't like the others, Arcade. You're still young. It's up to you to decide who you want to be.
AID00146886	True enough. Maybe I can't fill my father's shoes. I wouldn't even know how.
AID00146887	But if following in his footsteps for a while means I can do some good out here, I will do my best.
AID00146888	I need to go do something. I won't be gone long, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
AID00146889	Well you... you're different.
AID00146890	I am, but they're still my family. I think you were right the first time. If there's something I can do to help hold the dam, I'll do it.
AID00146891	Look, there's something I have to do, but I promise I'll be back in a while. Trust me. And thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
AID00146892	You were born at Navarro, but you are your own man. They have their fight, and you have yours.
AID00146893	True enough, I suppose. Getting them back together must be worth more than me spraying plasma all over the dam.
AID00146894	Back to Freeside it is. I need to make a stop before I settle in. I'll be back in a while. Thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
AID00146895	Now that you're free to leave you don't need your dog tag anymore do you?
AID00146896	You're probably right. Here, take it.
AID00146897	Goodbye.

AID00147054	What do you think I should do about ED-E? Brotherhood or Followers?
AID00147055	This shouldn't be too surprising, but I'd prefer you let the Followers examine him. Hopefully the reasons are obvious.
AID00147056	Don't worry. I agree.
AID00147057	Great. Then all is right with the world.
AID00147058	Understood.
AID00147059	Okay. Don't have to make a decision now. Just... sleep on it or something.
AID00147060	Why not the Brotherhood?
AID00147061	The Brotherhood hoards knowledge and is obviously a smidge more violent than the Followers.
AID00147062	Don't get me wrong. I'd rather the Brotherhood get the intel than see it lost somewhere in the desert, but I'd prefer the Followers overall.
AID00147063	Is the Enclave's treatment by the Brotherhood influencing your opinion?
AID00147064	Some of the old-timers like Moreno hold grudges against the Brotherhood and the NCR. I'd like to think I'm above that, but you may be right.
AID00147065	I'm not going to pout and cry if you give him to the Brotherhood. I'd rather they have it than allow all that knowledge to disappear.
AID00147066	I'd just prefer that it goes to an organization like the Followers, who are less likely to use it for... violent purposes.
AID00147067	ArcadeEDEOpinion
AID00147068	I don't know if you care about my opinion, but I'd prefer that you turn ED-E over to the Followers. Surprised, right?
AID00147069	ArcadeEDEEnclave
AID00147070	Wow. That thing is definitely carrying around a bunch of Enclave intel. Adams is on the eastern seaboard of the country.
AID00147071	Which means this little "Duraframe" sucker somehow managed to survive for over two thousand miles. Certainly lives up to its model name.

AID00147075	Moreno was a lost cause, but at least the others made it.
AID00147076	What are you going to do now?
AID00147077	Back to Old Mormon Fort, where I can do some good. We Followers may be idealistic but even I know this is going to end in blood.
AID00147078	Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
AID00147079	Thanks, I guess.
AID00147080	I have to admit, I did not expect that sort of response.
AID00147081	This is one of the last surviving suits of original-issue Tesla armor from Navarro and it was worn by my father but... yeah I guess it's no big deal.
AID00147082	Good luck at Hoover Dam. I'll uh... be going now, I guess.
AID00147083	I'm honored.
AID00147084	It's the least I could do. All I ask is that you put it to good use. This place has lived in the shadow of Caesar for long enough.
AID00147085	I may not be the one to help stop him here, but you are. Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
AID00147086	VIntroNarration
AID00147087	War. War never changes.
AID00147088	When atomic fire consumed the earth, those who survived did so in great underground vaults.
AID00147089	When they opened, their inhabitants set out across the ruins of the Old World to build new societies, establishing villages, forming tribes.
AID00147090	As decades passed, what had been the American southwest united
AID00147091	beneath the flag of the New California Republic, dedicated to Old World values of democracy and the rule of law.
AID00147092	As the Republic grew, so did its needs. Scouts spread east, seeking territory and wealth in the dry and merciless expanse of the Mojave desert.
AID00147093	They returned with tales of a city untouched by the warheads that had scorched the rest of the world - and a great wall spanning the Colorado River.
AID00147094	The NCR mobilized its army and sent it east, to occupy Hoover Dam and restore it to working condition.
AID00147095	But across the Colorado, another society had arisen, under a different flag.
AID00147096	A vast army of slaves forged from the conquest of 86 tribes - Caesar's Legion.
AID00147097	Four years have passed since the Republic held the dam - just barely - against the Legion's onslaught. The Legion did not retreat.
AID00147098	Across the river, it gathers strength. Camp fires burn, training drums beat.
AID00147099	Through it all, the New Vegas Strip has stayed open for business, under the control of its mysterious overseer, Mr. House,
AID00147100	and his army of rehabilitated tribals and police robots.
AID00147101	You are a Courier, hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip.
AID00147102	What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worse.

AID00147157	Did you ever hear it say anything odd?
AID00147158	Can't say that I have, of course I never saw it running for long, so I never heard it do much of anything.
AID00147159	Where did it come from?
AID00147160	A courier dropped it off a little bit ago. I'd hoped to get it up and running for some courier work, but never could get it running.
AID00147161	I have some questions about ED-E.

AID00147164	You're welcome to try. Its yours if you can get it working.
AID00147165	If I had my way I'd dump it in the scrapyard in Novac and be done with the damn thing.
AID00147166	What is wrong with it?
AID00147167	Hell if I know. I don't think its serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.

AID00147170	I haven't been able to get it up and running again. I was hoping to use it for some courier work, but that ain't gonna happen.
AID00147171	I have some questions about your robot.
AID00147172	That beat up old thing? What do you want to know?
AID00147173	Why can't you protect them?
AID00147174	We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts, and even if we did we need some extra hands for backup.
AID00147175	You should talk to Lieutenant Hayes. He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
AID00147176	Shouldn't you be protecting the town or something?
AID00147177	We'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction. Even if they did we're in no shape to protect them.
AID00147178	Thanks for the warning.
AID00147179	Be careful. You may want to talk to Lieutenant Hayes.
AID00147180	He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.

AID00147201	I already took care of Jackson. Er, the Jackson problem.
AID00147202	No shit? Drink's on me, then.
AID00147203	Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
AID00147204	Any other work?
AID00147205	RaulLoyal2
AID00147206	That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
AID00147207	If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
AID00147208	You seemed like you wanted to say something about Loyal.
AID00147209	RaulAndy2
AID00147210	Your memory is like a steel trap, boss. What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
AID00147211	You wanted to ask me something before, when we left Ranger Andy's.
AID00147212	RaulSterling2
AID00147213	Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
AID00147214	Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
AID00147215	You think he did the right thing?
AID00147216	You wanted to say something about Corporal Sterling before?
AID00147217	Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff using parts.
AID00147218	Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
AID00147219	<Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff using 3 fission batteries and 4 conductors.>
AID00147220	Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
AID00147221	<Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff using 3 fission batteries and 4 conductors.>
AID00147222	I've helped out around here, sending troops to Primm will fortify the NCR in the region.
AID00147223	I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
AID00147224	Earlier you said something about asking the Followers to provide medical aid?
AID00147225	About Hoover Dam...
AID00147226	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
AID00147227	Astor says there's a Ranger Station up north.
AID00147228	ArcadeSilverRush
AID00147229	I can keep killing you, if that's what you want.
AID00147230	Guess I owe you an apology for wrecking you the last time we talked.
AID00147231	That was my fault! But I've changed!
AID00147232	I thought you were dead.
AID00147233	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
AID00147234	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
AID00147235	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
AID00147236	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
AID00147237	Let's talk about something else.
AID00147238	Sorry if that was getting boring!

AID00147250	Is this because I didn't upgrade that army of Securitrons under Caesar's Fort?
AID00147251	Well, problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - probably - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
AID00147252	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
AID00147253	I want this dam out of operation.
AID00147254	Right, who wants a vast army of mechanical servants to savage your enemy? Why make it easy?
AID00147255	I'm setting the generators to blow, just like you asked. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
AID00147256	Send power to the Fort.
AID00147257	Yes! This is going to be fun!
AID00147258	I'm unlocking the East Power Plant. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
