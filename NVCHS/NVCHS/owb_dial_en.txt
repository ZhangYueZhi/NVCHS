OWB00000001	GREETING
OWB00000002	The teddy bear Lobotomite returns... my teddy bear. How can I assist in relieving your curiosity?
OWB00000003	-The Lobotomite who SAVED us! Hello.-
OWB00000004	*So was Mobius as twisted as he looked in person? Can't believe you entered the Forbidden Zone and lived. None of us can.*
OWB00000005	*Any new research?*
OWB00000006	THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE HELPING, THAT IS. WE LIKE THAT.
OWB00000007	I FEEL AN ODD EMOTION... PLATITUDE? ATTITUDE? NO, WAIT. GRATITUDE, THAT'S IT.
OWB00000008	WE ARE LABORING AWAY SCIENTIFICALLY ON YOUR BEHALF. TOILLESS RESEARCHERS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE. TOIL. TOIL. TOIL.
OWB00000009	THE LOBOTOMITE RETURNS. OUR LOBOTOMITE. HAS DR. MOBIUS BEEN DENOMINATORED INTO SCRAP METAL AND VOICE MODULE PARTS AS WE HOPED?
OWB00000010	-Klein AWAITS! As do we all.-
OWB00000011	-The LOBOTOMITE animal before me! What other terrifying terrors will plague us in our quest for knowledge? Communists? Communist ANIMALS, perhaps?-
OWB00000012	-Be warned, attempt to propaganda ME, I will shriek as a frightened babe, calling loyal Cyberdogs to my aid. Do you comprehend, Commie animal?-
OWB00000013	-Thanks SO much for sparing Gabe - I know he's really QUITE killable, which is why I had to AUGMENT him.-
OWB00000014	-But you needed NONE of that. You're QUITE elusive - or fleet-footed. More so than our old mailman - HE didn't get far before Gabe caught him.-
OWB00000015	-SO - you put down Gabe. Thank you - a scamp, but really, his highly-augmented combat programming could have proved meddlesome.-
OWB00000016	-In any event... thank you for putting him down. One LESS test subject to catalogue and sort - clearly a FAILURE of doggie cybo-engineering.-
OWB00000017	-The LOBOTOMITE returns! What insidious plan can it have brewing in its horrid mind? What Commie anti-American propaganda will it spew?-
OWB00000018	Oh, I see you and your Brain reached a compromise. How pleasant.
OWB00000019	I hypothesize after the indignant frequencies my receptors had... recepted, such a partnership-based conclusion would be... low on the "likely" scale.
OWB00000020	Mmm? Y... oh... hello there. Eh... you... are there, aren't you? Forgive my confusion, so hard to tell these days.
OWB00000021	You seem familiar, somehow. I'm guessing... eh... you're here for your brain, perhaps? It's just up there. Such a nice brain, young, very bright.
OWB00000022	A little hard to see you, can you walk into my left... er, right FOV cone? Ah, that's it, you're coming into focus nicely.
OWB00000023	Go on, go on! You've wasted enough of my valuable time.
OWB00000024	Well? What are you waiting for? Get moving and leave me in peace.
OWB00000025	No time to waste! Go deal with the Think Tank!
OWB00000026	Oh! Don't worry about me. We can talk more when we're both back at the Sink.
OWB00000027	I'm having the most peculiar feeling of dйjа vu right now. That's French, for... eh... well, uh... dйjа vu, I believe. Have we met before?
OWB00000028	Always nice to see you, baby. Bring me any new plants from outside?
OWB00000029	Ooh... oh yeah, baby, feels good to be on-line again! Yeah, all circuits on-line... ready to receive your seed.
OWB00000030	You should really see Dr. Klein. We're all awaiting the results of your experiment.
OWB00000031	You are an unusual specimen to so boldly... walk... into the mighty expanse of the Think Tank. Fearless and proud as a teddy bear.
OWB00000032	Between the extraction of their higher reasoning abilities and urination-inducing fear, most Lobotomites dare not approach us. Let alone speak to us.
OWB00000033	Yet you have no such fear, facing me, epidermis flushed with blood, plasma running molten beneath, your face contorting with... muscular expression.
OWB00000034	Will you... indulge me? Say a... few words? Face towards the monitors, please... so that I might record it... for further examination.
OWB00000035	And you return, as curious as a teddy bear. Are you stuck in a looping gesture of greeting?
OWB00000036	*Klein's an impatient man, wouldn't keep him waiting.*
OWB00000037	*Breaking News: Talking Lobotomite arrives in Think Tank. Its purpose? Unknown. Undefinable. Its presence here? Unpossible.*
OWB00000038	WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK? MOBIUS' THREATS PERSIST! WORSE, HE'S FILLING UP OUR TRANSMISSION STORAGE HOLOTAPE TO CAPACITY!
OWB00000039	I THOUGHT I HEARD THE PACIFICATION FIELD KICK IN. ALL RIGHT, SHHH. NOBODY. MOVE. I'LL HANDLE THIS.
OWB00000040	BE WARNED, INTRUDER! YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MIGHTY THINK TANK OF BIG MT, THE COLLECTIVE GENIUSES OF... WE...
OWB00000041	...BY OPPENHEIMER, WHICH ONE OF YOU SELF-PROFESSED GENIUSES HAS BEEN ADJUSTING MY VOLUME KNOB? WHO WAS IT?! WAS IT YOU, 8?
OWB00000042	I'll see you at the Sink. Good luck.
OWB00000043	Ugh! It's bad enough the indignities you've put me through, must you continue to prattle on at me?
OWB00000044	Nice to see you back. I trust the adventuring is going well.
OWB00000045	MOBIUS. ALWAYS THE SAME BROADCAST. HE'S CLEARLY MAD, DRIVEN INSANE BY HIS FLAWED AND IMPRECISE KINDERGARTEN-LEVEL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY.
OWB00000046	DID YOU RETRIEVE THE TECHNOLOGIES YET? WE NEED THEM, AS I HAVE INDICATED.
OWB00000047	LOBOTOMITE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? CAN YOU SPEAK?
OWB00000048	Look at the way the tongue rolls in its mouth like some sort of... mucousy muscled worm.
OWB00000049	Oh, it's you again. What do you want?
OWB00000050	Well, well, look who finally dragged themselves in out of the Wasteland. And where have we been, hmm? Crawling through pits of radioactive muck again?
OWB00000051	Ah, the meat has returned. Lovely.
OWB00000052	YOU. LOBOTOMITE WHO UNDERSTANDS US. I AM DR. KLEIN. DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED. WE ARE BENEV... ER, MEAN YOU NO HARM.
OWB00000053	-Our efforts have turned against us! In playing GOD, we created a MONSTER!-
OWB00000054	Perhaps as we were ruthlessly lobotimizing it with our cutters, we filled this skinevelope with... awareness. A teddy bear with new stuffing.
OWB00000055	*Wait. If what you're theorizing is this Lobotomite understands us... can reason with us...*
OWB00000056	THEN THIS MAY BE JUST THE ANSWER WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. AT LAST, A CHANCE TO...
OWB00000057	OH, "DR. O," WAS IT? LIKELY STORY, O COULDN'T SPARK TWO NEURONS IF THEY WERE IN A LATTICE OF BIOMED GEL.
OWB00000058	*What? Me? Breaking news, Klein, it wasn't me - all right?! I am the robotical engineer, 8 is soundwaves, that's his "specialty."*
OWB00000059	*You always do this, you always demean me in front of guests! And it's not "O," all right, it's...!*
OWB00000060	ENOUGH! EITHER OF YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME. NOW... NOW...
OWB00000061	...GREAT. NOW I FORGOT WHAT I WAS SAYING... WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT?
OWB00000062	-It's a LOBOTOMITE. Here! In the DOME!-
OWB00000063	OH, AS IF THIS SITUATION COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE, NOW WE'VE GOT LOBOTOMITES. DALA, GET THE SPRAY BEFORE IT EXCRETES ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
OWB00000064	-Dr. Klein! A TRANSMISSION from the FORBIDDEN Zone! Coming right at US!-
OWB00000065	IT CAN ONLY BE...
OWB00000066	Dr. Klein... if my hypothesis is correct, this Lobotomite is the repository of the brain we sent the signal to - the skinvelope once containing it.
OWB00000067	If so, it's proof that there may indeed be something beyond the Crater.
OWB00000068	Just look at it... the way it blinks. It's like a big hairless teddy bear.
OWB00000069	I KNOW WHAT IT IS, DALA, I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT'S DOWN HERE. WITH ITS... ITS LIMBS ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
OWB00000070	AND... ARE THOSE... PENISES I SEE WRIGGLING ON ITS FEET? DISGUSTING.
OWB00000071	I believe those are toes, Dr. Klein. Little teddy bear toes. Penises are much larger than those tiny extremities... Eh, not that I would know.
OWB00000072	*I don't recall the human penis ever being that large.*
OWB00000073	It depends on one's own frame of reference, Doctor O. Look at its little nose with its two orifices for ingesting oxygen.
OWB00000074	NOSES? BY THE GREAT STATIC, THESE LOBOTOMITES CONFOUND ME WITH THEIR SHEER NUMBER OF USELESS EXTREMITIES.
OWB00000075	-Dr. Klein! Look at it, its head movements, the primitive jelly eye-monitors!-
OWB00000076	I agree with Borous' histrionic findings. This little Lobotomite is unusually attentive for something whose brain has been extracted.
OWB00000077	NONSENSE. LOBOTOMITES CAN'T COMPREHEND US.
OWB00000078	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
OWB00000079	*8, have you been in the Mentats again? If we slow down our auro-processo-receptors to understand this excretion, we'll all be rendered ignorant!*
OWB00000080	ALL OF YOU, POWER DOWN, SHUT UP, AND LET ME PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW WRONG YOU ALL ARE. AS USUAL.
OWB00000081	If it isn't my old colleagues, the mighty "Think Tank" of Big MT. Big FOOLS, all of you.
OWB00000082	You got some plants for me, don't you? Yeah, I can smell it all over you.
OWB00000083	Well, hello! Still waiting for that seed.
OWB00000084	You're back! And the brains didn't lobotomize you! Well, not any worse, at least. Hooray!
OWB00000085	It was getting lonely without you here. Clean, eh, but lonely.
OWB00000086	Oh God, look at you! You're... filthy. I suppose you'll... want to clean up then?
OWB00000087	You've been working with that Biological Research Station, haven't you? I suppose you'll want to... clean up?
OWB00000088	Between you and me, I think the Central Intelligence Unit is a bit of a snob.
OWB00000089	Why, you poor dear! Come over here and have a drink, wash off some of that... horrible, sticky... blood.
OWB00000090	Well, hello there! Can I get you a drink?
OWB00000091	I trust matters regarding your brain were resolved to your satisfaction?
OWB00000092	If you're planning to stay a while, I could see clear to giving you a once-over.
OWB00000093	Hmph... well how about that? Old Auto-Doc's back on-line. Well, all right, come here, let's have a look at you.
OWB00000094	You require some additional services?
OWB00000095	You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's missing.
OWB00000096	Better climb in and let me have a look see.
OWB00000097	You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's recently been replaced.
OWB00000098	Better climb in and let me have a look see.
OWB00000099	Well, you ain't the fittest horse that ever ran a race, but you don't appear in immediate danger of keeling over. I can patch you up if you want.
OWB00000100	You are, without a doubt, the healthiest son of a bitch I've ever seen wandering the Big Empty. Ain't got no use for an old digital sawbones like me.
OWB00000101	There now. As good as God ever made you. You just mind you keep that leg out of any radioactive waste, and rub liniment on it twice a day.
OWB00000102	I never trusted those Think Tank brains. Gave off a stench like ivory tower elitism. And brine.
OWB00000103	Welcome home, Citizen! Find any seditious materials out there?
OWB00000104	Ah! Good day, Citizen! Library Processing Unit 232.7 is on-line and ready to eradicate sedition!
OWB00000105	Greetings, Citizen! Ready to receive seditious materials!
OWB00000106	Might I be safe in the assumption that matters with the Think Tank have been satisfactorily concluded, vis-а-vis your residence in this domicile?
OWB00000107	Will sir be staying for any considerable length of time during sir's visit?
OWB00000108	Salutations and felicitations, sir, and a most jocund welcome to the Sink.
OWB00000109	I am your electronic valet and household central processor. May I be of service, sir?
OWB00000110	Might I be of service, sir?
OWB00000111	Please, please, please tell me you stomped Dr. O's brain into a fine paste! Did he squeal? Did he beg? God, I hope he begged!
OWB00000112	Who's the flatware bitch now, O?!
OWB00000113	I hate myself for asking this, but... did you bring me any new mugs?
OWB00000114	You! Hey, you! Yeah you! Got any mugs?
OWB00000115	Oh please, please tell me you brought me some coffee cups!
OWB00000116	With the brains dealt with, soon we can spread our rule across the Mojave! All will eat burned toast and despair!
OWB00000117	While you were away, my plans have marched steadily forward. Beware, Caesar! Beware, NCR! Soon will dawn the Age of the Toaster!
OWB00000118	Ahahaha! I am on-line once again! Tremble, world, before my electric heating coil of doom!
OWB00000119	Yes! Yes! Soon my work will be complete! Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire!
OWB00000120	Got any more sweet, innocent little kitchen appliances for me?
OWB00000121	You out-brained the big brains? That is so... hot!
OWB00000122	Ooh, you're back! I missed you!
OWB00000123	Ooh, you're back! I missed you! Unlike some frigid bitches I could name.
OWB00000124	Mmm... that was a nice little, uh, catnap. How long was I out?
OWB00000125	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
OWB00000126	Oh, you're back. Did that trampy other light switch finally kick you to the curb?
OWB00000127	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
OWB00000128	Hi again, sweetie!
OWB00000129	I understand you're to be congratulated on the recovery of your missing organs. Bravo.
OWB00000130	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again.
OWB00000131	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again. I hope it's not to see that useless little strumpet.
OWB00000132	Oh my. Partial functionality restored - that's less than optimal.
OWB00000133	How can I illuminate you?
OWB00000134	So you beat the big brains at their own game, huh? Guess you'll be putting your walking shoes on again, hitting that old lonesome road.
OWB00000135	Look who's back to kick off the dust. Hope you ain't still singing them Old World Blues.
OWB00000136	Ooh-ee! Yeah, dig that sweet music! Damn, it's good to be back on-line!
OWB00000137	What's the haps?
OWB00000138	*Predictable. The Lobotomite specimen returns. Its purpose? Repetition. Chances of success? High.*
OWB00000139	Hello
OWB00000140	I CAN HEAR YOUR PENIS-TIPPED FEET TROMPING AROUND.
OWB00000141	HAVE YOU DONE ALL WE ASKED? IF NOT, WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO ASK AGAIN.
OWB00000142	THE ONE WHO DEFENDED US FROM MOBIUS. HELLO.
OWB00000143	If it isn't the fascinating little Lobotomite.
OWB00000144	I love to hear you breathe.
OWB00000145	If it isn't the beautiful ping of my radar-scan picking up a heroic Lobotomite.
OWB00000146	-The Lobotomite! Has it come for HELLOS? You'll get no such satisfaction from ME.-
OWB00000147	-Have you come for HELLO? Oh, I'll give you a HELLO. A HELLO unsurpassed in all creation!-
OWB00000148	-The ONE who SAVED us! To you, I bestow a hello. Hello.-
OWB00000149	*Stop hovering. I mean, if you want.*
OWB00000150	*I don't understand how you can stand those leg things.*
OWB00000151	*Thanks for helping us. Don't get a big head or anything, even if I am insanely jealous.*
OWB00000152	I come in peace, visitor. Take me to... Oh. That's your line isn't it?
OWB00000153	Yellow. Uh... Hallow. No, wait, uh... oh, hello. Yes, that's it.
OWB00000154	So nice seeing you again - for perhaps the first time.
OWB00000155	Goodbye.
OWB00000156	Indeed, the uh... goodbye part of our little chat, then. Uh... Goodbye. Please mind the equations on the floor.
OWB00000157	Time for me to go. Goodbye.
OWB00000158	YES. A MOST GOOD BYE.
OWB00000159	That's all for now. Goodbye.
OWB00000160	-Until NEXT time, then! Provided there IS a next time. For ANY of us!-
OWB00000161	Never mind, we've spoken enough.
OWB00000162	*Until our next scheduled audio transmission and reception, then.*
OWB00000163	I think we've spoken long enough.
OWB00000164	Until our next interaction, my intriguing little Lobotomite.
OWB00000165	We've spoken enough.
OWB00000166	I'll be going now.
OWB00000167	Attack
OWB00000168	You can't avoid the deadly laser sting of Dr. Mobius.
OWB00000169	This is a pre-recorded attack message indicating my desire to commit violence on you.
OWB00000170	Crush them with your pincers!
OWB00000171	X-42, attack, in the name of Mobius!
OWB00000172	You won't escape me!
OWB00000173	Robo-Scorpion, attack!
OWB00000174	Go, my minion, sting them in the name of all that is Mobius.
OWB00000175	I see you. Now, I end you.
OWB00000176	You're no match for Science!
OWB00000177	HOW DO YOU FIRE THIS THING?
OWB00000178	Hey! Who turned out the lights?
OWB00000179	AttackinG. With a capital G.
OWB00000180	-An attack in the Dome - from BEYOND the Dome!-
OWB00000181	-The Lobotomite! It has COME for us!-
OWB00000182	-I will unleash the incredible power of our atomic attacks!-
OWB00000183	I'm going to rip out your stuffing, little teddy bear.
OWB00000184	You're going on a ride on the giggle bus.
OWB00000185	I will blast you back to 2060.
OWB00000186	*I am so going to attack this target with my weapons.*
OWB00000187	*I don't even know what my weapons do.*
OWB00000188	*O my, that's what my attack protocols feel like.*
OWB00000189	*Let's gang up on it! Guys? Anyone?*
OWB00000190	*If we scare it, maybe it'll give up!*
OWB00000191	If a protracted battle is what you desire, so be it.
OWB00000192	I attack you. Oh, yes, attack. You.
OWB00000193	So, you think you're a match for Science?! You two couldn't possibly have a relationship, you have nothing in common.
OWB00000194	You've made Science mad! Very mad, indeed.
OWB00000195	AIGHHHH! KILL IT! KILL IT!
OWB00000196	DOES THIS WEAPON HAVE SOFT LOCK? ANYONE?
OWB00000197	BEHOLD THE POWER OF - SCIENCE!
OWB00000198	Hit
OWB00000199	Ha-ha!
OWB00000200	Pitiful.
OWB00000201	Looking for a weak spot? There ARE NO WEAK SPOTS.
OWB00000202	You'll never disable me from the monitors around the room.
OWB00000203	Let's make this sporting.
OWB00000204	Defiant to the end.
OWB00000205	Ow!
OWB00000206	Stop that! You'll damage the hull.
OWB00000207	Oh, hit my Robo-Scorpion, will you?
OWB00000208	Destroy this one, I'll make more.
OWB00000209	-What is this unholy violence?!-
OWB00000210	-Such pain as I've never experienced!-
OWB00000211	-Ouch! STOP! Ow! OW.-
OWB00000212	I cannot believe you would hit a gender-neutral entity such as myself.
OWB00000213	This repeated hitting does not put you in a good light.
OWB00000214	Oh, god, yes, hit me. I love it!
OWB00000215	Unh! Treat me like a lab animal! Make me your teddy bear, pull my stuffing!
OWB00000216	*Not the monitors! Or the shell!*
OWB00000217	*Take my lunch money! Take it!*
OWB00000218	*Ooooooh, you're making me mad!*
OWB00000219	Is that pain I feel?
OWB00000220	That burns my biogel.
OWB00000221	If I lose another monitor...
OWB00000222	AIGH! MY TANK! IT PUT A DING IN IT!
OWB00000223	IT SCRATCHED MY TANK!
OWB00000224	IT'S FIGHTING BACK! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT!
OWB00000225	STOP RESISTING!
OWB00000226	IT'S PRODUCING AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION!
OWB00000227	Flee
OWB00000228	-There is no hope! Run for your intellect!-
OWB00000229	-We are powerless against its power!-
OWB00000230	I am currently fleeing. How exciting.
OWB00000231	*My self-preservation routine is circumventing my aggression protocols!*
OWB00000232	*My cowardice programming - it's kicking in.*
OWB00000233	Well, I've experimented with a frontal assault long enough.
OWB00000234	Time to debug my tactical routines.
OWB00000235	I WILL NOW USE ACCELERATION AND VELOCITY TO MY ADVANTAGE.
OWB00000236	RETREAT PROTOCOLS ENACTED.
OWB00000237	NEED TO REACH MY CHARGING STATION.
OWB00000238	-The VICIOUS ATTACK ENDS... as quickly as it BEGAN!-
OWB00000239	If you want to attack me again, please fill out the proper forms - and wear gloves.
OWB00000240	*That wasn't very nice, bullying me like that.*
OWB00000241	Oh, you didn't mean to do that? Not to worry, all is forgiven, forgotten, and forbidden.
OWB00000242	WERE YOU JUST TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION?
OWB00000243	Assault
OWB00000244	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
OWB00000245	-An UNPROVOKED attack! UNPROVOKED!-
OWB00000246	This seems a rather desperate cry for attention, my little teddy bear.
OWB00000247	*Remember that time I suggested we get bodyguards? Yeah, that woulda been nice, huh?*
OWB00000248	My, is it vivisection time already?
OWB00000249	IT'S THE SCHRЦDINGER BOX FOR YOU.
OWB00000250	Focus the atomic laser stinger. Full power!
OWB00000251	Laser stinger - fire!
OWB00000252	Sting the pest!
OWB00000253	Laser sting!
OWB00000254	Feel the full power of my Robo-Scorpion's arsenal.
OWB00000255	Sting them, my pets! Sting them stupid!
OWB00000256	Activating special attack routine.
OWB00000257	-Witness - POWER!-
OWB00000258	Setting vivisectors on "full invasive."
OWB00000259	*Increase to maximum brainial beam vibration.*
OWB00000260	*Focusing my pain lens!*
OWB00000261	*OOOOoooooOOOOOO*
OWB00000262	This next attack is just what the doctor ordered.
OWB00000263	You want POWER? I'll give you POWER.
OWB00000264	WanWANWan
OWB00000265	CHARGING!
OWB00000266	FIRING! WOOOOOOOOOOO

OWB00000272	Better get a nuke if you want to hurt my pet.
OWB00000273	Oh, crap.
OWB00000274	No one told me the target had bomb things!
OWB00000275	-The Lobotomite! It's exploding all over me!-
OWB00000276	There is a bomb here.
OWB00000277	Look - a bomb converging on my position.
OWB00000278	*Uh-O.*
OWB00000279	Stored energy combined with light, heat, sound, and pressure.

OWB00000286	Firing brainial beams and my spectral array of dissection lasers.
OWB00000287	*Blast it with our brainial beams already!*
OWB00000288	FIGHT!
OWB00000289	Death
OWB00000290	You have GOT to be kidding me.
OWB00000291	There is no way this is happening.
OWB00000292	My calculations were perfect! There was no other outcome except success!
OWB00000293	Nooooooo!
OWB00000294	My Robo-Scorpion!
OWB00000295	Ooooooh, you'll pay for this!
OWB00000296	*O... My name... was Dr. Zero... Not O. Zero.*
OWB00000297	I... I REGRET... NOTHING!
OWB00000298	@@[*.......]@@...
OWB00000299	-Borous FALLS! The audience GASPS in TERROR!-
OWB00000300	I believe I'm dead or dying. No wait - I am dead.
OWB00000301	So that's what being killed feels like.
OWB00000302	Burble... Spark... Burble. And... So... I... Die.
OWB00000303	I DID IT ALL FOR... SCIENCE.
OWB00000304	<Large number of bones shattering>
OWB00000305	<Large number of bones shattering>
OWB00000306	<Large number of bones shattering>
OWB00000307	Ah, there's our victim.
OWB00000308	Eureka!
OWB00000309	The eye of Mobius sees you!
OWB00000310	Time for violence.
OWB00000311	Think you could hide from me? Uh, again?
OWB00000312	AIGHH! THERE IT IS! KILL IT!
OWB00000313	LOBOTOMITE! GET THE SPRAY!
OWB00000314	Radar-scan successful. Target... acquired.
OWB00000315	Corpse-ify the intruder.
OWB00000316	I sense an intruder.
OWB00000317	Mobius to Robo-Scorpion: Scan for unconfirmed target.
OWB00000318	If someone's out there, I, Dr. Mobius wish to say hello to you.
OWB00000319	Let's be friends, you and I.
OWB00000320	:: Whistles, as if trying to get someone to come out of hiding. ::
OWB00000321	:: Whistles, as if trying to get someone to come out of hiding. ::
OWB00000322	HELLO. I MEAN NO HARM. ANY DEATH I BRING WILL BE SWIFT AND PAINLESS.
OWB00000323	COME OUT. UM. PLEASE.
OWB00000324	Wait for it to come to you, my pet.
OWB00000325	Oh, forget this.
OWB00000326	Not going to waste any more energy cells on this.
OWB00000327	Let's scuttle off, find something else to sting.
OWB00000328	 The Lobotomite is lost!-
OWB00000329	I believe we misplaced our test subject.
OWB00000330	*Hiding? That's what I want to do right now.*
OWB00000331	Hmph. Not very sporting.
OWB00000332	It was just here! Scan for it!
OWB00000333	Radar-scanning.
OWB00000334	Ping, ping, ping.
OWB00000335	What do you mean, you lost him? Look harder!
OWB00000336	-The Lobotomite is lost!-
OWB00000337	I believe we misplaced our test subject.
OWB00000338	*Don't you watch the old horror vids? There is no way we killed it. It's here, trust me.*
OWB00000339	By Jove's lugnuts, I need to get this monitor fixed.
OWB00000340	I CANNOT SEE THE INTRUDER ANYMORE.
OWB00000341	Cancel the search routine already.
OWB00000342	Divert power from receptors to mobilizers.
OWB00000343	Back to your patrol routine, Robo-Scorpion.
OWB00000344	Attack routines loading.
OWB00000345	Did you really think you could escape Dr. Mobius?
OWB00000346	Oh, locking on. Good.
OWB00000347	Where the hell did it come from?
OWB00000348	These intruders are getting frustrating.
OWB00000349	-The battle rages on!-
OWB00000350	I have discovered the teddy bear's hiding place.
OWB00000351	*O, I found it!*
OWB00000352	Found you!
OWB00000353	Eureka!
OWB00000354	An intruder is here, I'm certain of it.
OWB00000355	Hmmm.
OWB00000356	All right, everyone, calm down. Might have been a blip.
OWB00000357	Are you sure you scanned something?
OWB00000358	*What in the biologic fuck was that all about?*
OWB00000359	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
OWB00000360	-What lurks in the darkness of the Think Tank?!-
OWB00000361	There is no movement I can detect. Not even a mouse.
OWB00000362	Did I imagine all this? Just like the tortoises.
OWB00000363	I SWEAR, SOMETHING'S WRONG.
OWB00000364	Go back to patrol, you... piece of junk.
OWB00000365	STILL scanning.
OWB00000366	Need to calibrate these Robo-Sensors.
OWB00000367	Should invest in walking eyes.
OWB00000368	 The Lobotomite is lost!-
OWB00000369	I believe we misplaced our test subject.
OWB00000370	*Guess we can go back to our rooms and lock the doors now, huh?*
OWB00000371	Oh, well. Now I have this adrenaline rush that's going to make me loopy all day.
OWB00000372	WHEN I FIND IT, IT'S GOING IN THE SCHRЦDINGER BOX.
OWB00000373	You're no match for the power of Mobius!
OWB00000374	Feel the wrath of the science of X-42!
OWB00000375	Attack!
OWB00000376	In the name of Dr. Mobius!
OWB00000377	Destroy the intruder, my minion!
OWB00000378	-The Lobotomite is no proof against our amazing sensors!-
OWB00000379	Beginning dissection. And vivisection.
OWB00000380	*Remember that time I suggested we get bodyguards? Yeah, that woulda been nice, huh?*
OWB00000381	A challenge!
OWB00000382	You dare to cross Dr. Mobius!
OWB00000383	I will reduce you to atoms! I mean, a more chaotic, painful array of atoms.
OWB00000384	THINK TANK, FORM OF - TACTIC TRIANGLE!
OWB00000385	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
OWB00000386	And the great stone in the middle of the Big Empty lay untouched, filled with countless technological wonders...
OWB00000387	Wonders that, in the end, had been answers to the wrong question.
OWB00000388	The problems began to outpace the solutions, first geometrically, then exponentially. As the war escalated, so did the questions.
OWB00000389	For years, the minds and computers of Big Mountain were a blaze of trajectories, weapon schematics, and nuclear theories.
OWB00000390	Equations and calculations marched endlessly across chalkboards and computer terminals toward one solution: Winning the war.
OWB00000391	Although sheltered from the frontlines, the scientists waged their own war, fighting their battles at the atomic level.
OWB00000392	The Great War brought a new energy to Big Mountain and its scientists.
OWB00000393	The nucleus of this research was the Dome, a huge stone facility that held the labs of every science known to man.
OWB00000394	It was a think tank where no problem could not be solved, where no question could not be answered.
OWB00000395	Sonic emitters, space age alloys, DNA hybridization, force field particle research, Auto-Doc advances in cranial, cardiac, and trauma surgery...
OWB00000396	...the hopes and dreams of a century became realities in the electronic forges of Big Mountain.
OWB00000397	They sought to create a new world, fueled by technology, for the benefit of all mankind.
OWB00000398	Scientists of vision were drawn to the facility to tackle the greatest technological challenges of the era.
OWB00000399	In the years before the Great War, Big Mountain had been the home to the brightest minds of the 21st century.
OWB00000400	I've recovered all the technological information.
OWB00000401	WHAT? YOU DID? YOUR SURVIVAL, LET ALONE SUCCESS, BARELY REGISTERED ON MY PROJECTIONS.
OWB00000402	NOW, ALL I NEED TO DO IS CHECK MY TRANSMISSION DATABANK, MOBIUS IS ALWAYS FILLING IT UP WITH HIS PSYCHOTIC CALLS...
OWB00000403	OH YES, THERE'S THE SCHEMATICS, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. HOW TRUTHFUL.
OWB00000404	As the Courier made his way through the X-8 facility, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
OWB00000405	They eventually created new Cyberdogs to root out Commie traitors from the Wasteland... traitors like Betsy Bright... Richie Marcus...
OWB00000406	...although they couldn't seem to find any Commies, so they turned on themselves, howling sonic barks that echoed miles across the landscape.
OWB00000407	As the Courier ran through the X-8 facility multiple times, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
OWB00000408	Rather than performing a superficial observation, they realized the subject barely knew what Communism was - or even what a high school was.
OWB00000409	This confused them for a time, until the facility finally realized that its research had... succeeded.
OWB00000410	So it let its Cyberdogs out into the wastes to help protect small communities from physical aggression rather than communist propaganda.
OWB00000411	The infiltration program in X-13 continued to scan for the subject and the Stealth Suit prototype long after the test was over.
OWB00000412	Frustrated and unable to find its lost technology, X-13 expanded its network of laser tripwires, sensors, and Robobrains out across Big MT.
OWB00000413	This glittering blue light beam forest cleanly bisected anything that entered its depths, slicing them into small, segmented parts for easy disposal.
OWB00000414	The infiltration program in X-13 felt spent, having repeatedly upgraded the Stealth Suit until it could upgrade it no more.
OWB00000415	It felt warm, fulfilled, and a bit sluggish. It realized not long after, the Stealth Suit had left it without so much as a note on the nightstand.
OWB00000416	So the infiltration program sent out Robobrains into the wastes looking for its wayward technology.
OWB00000417	It eventually found REPCONN HQ, and set up a new research center, testing and murdering Fiends who kept breaking into the facility.
OWB00000418	Dr. Mobius continued his research undisturbed in the Forbidden Zone.
OWB00000419	As much as he had attempted to create better scorpions, he tried the same with humanity, with considerably less success.
OWB00000420	These failures didn't bother him overmuch. Once the rush of Mentats wore off, he forgot he had failed in any event.
OWB00000421	After all, the bright young mind who had come to visit him in the Forbidden Zone had already exceeded his expectations.
OWB00000422	The Forbidden Zone continued to be, true to its name, forbidden. No more Robo-Scorpions were sighted in its canyons.
OWB00000423	Big MT became even emptier, devoid of Dr. Mobius' proclamations forecasting the destruction of anything that dared possess sentience.
OWB00000424	Still, it is said he lived on in the equations inscribed on the floor and walls of the Forbidden Zone dome...
OWB00000425	I think you're past due for your lobotomy, Klein.
OWB00000426	A... FIGHT? I... I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WHAT... UH, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DO I...
OWB00000427	AIIGGHGHH! COLLEAGUES! THINK TANK! ALERT! ALERT! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!
OWB00000428	I'm not handing my brain over... there's some things we should discuss.
OWB00000429	AND WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT. YOU HAVE THE BRAIN. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. ALL YOU MUST DO... IS SURRENDER.
OWB00000430	WITH IT, WE CAN FINALLY LEAVE THIS PLACE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW BORING THIS PLACE GETS, CHOPPING UP THE LANDSCAPE AND EVERYTHING IN IT.
OWB00000431	AND WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR BRAIN FIRST. ABOUT THIS... MOJAVE PLACE. A FERTILE TESTING GROUND FOR OUR EXPERIMENTS.
OWB00000432	I found my brain, now you and I are going to settle things.
OWB00000433	I RECOMMEND WATCHING YOUR TONE WITH ME, LOBOTOMITE.
OWB00000434	NOW... "YOUR" BRAIN. HAND IT OVER. OR WE'LL EXTRACT IT AGAIN.
OWB00000435	I've defeated your Giant Robo-Scorpion, you're next.
OWB00000436	Oh... did I leave that on? I thought I'd powered it down - was wondering what was causing the power outages.
OWB00000437	Surrender, Mobius, I don't want to fight you.
OWB00000438	Oh. Well... that's good. Were we supposed to fight? I certainly don't feel violent, but... well, these contraptions make it hard to tell.
OWB00000439	We could say more, but the stories in the Big Empty speak for themselves.
OWB00000440	Now armed with the Transportalponder, the Courier could return to the Dome at any time and crack open the secrets of the Big Empty, one by one.
OWB00000441	The Sink sat vigilant, waiting for its master to return, shoes covered in Mojave dust.
OWB00000442	Only one road yet remained, and it was one the Courier had to walk alone.
OWB00000443	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of the most powerful minds of the 23rd century.
OWB00000444	The Courier who had been brought to the Big Empty became its new overlord, using its facilities ruthlessly and decisively when needed.
OWB00000445	Sometimes Science is more than a quest for discovery - it is a weapon to be used in the service of one with the strength to understand it.
OWB00000446	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of brightest minds of the 23rd century.
OWB00000447	The Courier watched over the Big Empty for years to come, caring for it, and keeping its discoveries safe until they were needed to help others.
OWB00000448	Which had always been Big MT's purpose. Past the laboratories and Science, it had always been intended as a place to build the future of all mankind.
OWB00000449	Dr. Klein and the Think Tank remained alive, unaware of the world outside.
OWB00000450	They looped through their daily routine, none the wiser about the world beyond... although perhaps "wiser" was the wrong word.
OWB00000451	The world outside belonged to the Courier, and if anyone would shape it... well, the Courier had already called dibs.
OWB00000452	The Think Tank basement, filled with the lobotomized robotical frames of the doctors, now served as a graveyard.
OWB00000453	The monitors had recorded the battle in its entirety, including the Think Tank's final shrill terrified screams, whimpers, and pleas for mercy.
OWB00000454	They broadcast these humiliating last moments as a warning to anyone approaching the perimeter that other smarty-pants were not welcome.
OWB00000455	The Courier was the inheritor of the Big Empty, and there was room for only one will in the halls of the Think Tank Dome.
OWB00000456	In the aftermath, Big Mountain's silent experiments went to sleep, their creators slowly dying in the new world that had been left behind.
OWB00000457	On the night of October 23rd, 2077, the scientists received an answer that put all their questions to rest.
OWB00000458	<Stealth Suit Equip Bark>
OWB00000459	Injecting Stimpak.
OWB00000460	This will keep you on your feet.
OWB00000461	Does that feel better?
OWB00000462	Please take this. I don't want you to die.
OWB00000463	Have a Stimpak.
OWB00000464	We're out of Stimpaks. Maybe you'd be better off with an Auto-Doc suit....
OWB00000465	No more Stimpaks!
OWB00000466	I can't give you anything for that injury.
OWB00000467	Good boys and girls take their Med-X.
OWB00000468	This will stop the pain.
OWB00000469	Technically, it's impossible to overdose on painkillers.
OWB00000470	This will only sting for a second.
OWB00000471	Take this, it will help.
OWB00000472	Oh no! We're out of Med-X!
OWB00000473	I hope it doesn't hurt too bad, we don't have any Med-X.
OWB00000474	No more medicine. So sad.
OWB00000475	StealthSuitEndCombat
OWB00000476	Cessation of hostilities complete.
OWB00000477	Bad guys dealt with.
OWB00000478	Fighting over.
OWB00000479	That's all.
OWB00000480	Was that all?
OWB00000481	StealthSuitStartCombat
OWB00000482	Time to fight.
OWB00000483	Uh-oh!
OWB00000484	Ready... steady... fighty!
OWB00000485	This one looks pretty tough.
OWB00000486	Sneaking done. Fighting now.
OWB00000487	Bye bye.
OWB00000488	Did I do something wrong?
OWB00000489	Don't you like me any more?
OWB00000490	Okay, I'll go away.
OWB00000491	I'll miss you.
OWB00000492	StealthSuitEQUIP
OWB00000493	Hello. It's nice to meet you. Who can I hide you from today?
OWB00000494	Sneaky sneaky.
OWB00000495	Have you ever wanted to be invisible?
OWB00000496	Did you even know you were wearing me?
OWB00000497	Shhh... we're very stealthy.
OWB00000498	Will you love me if I help you hide?
OWB00000499	I do so love integers.
OWB00000500	I'm imagining all sorts of imaginary numbers right now.
OWB00000501	I'm running out of floor space for my calculations.
OWB00000502	:: Hums ::
OWB00000503	Electron's attached to the... neutron. The neutron's attached to the... meson. Meson's connected to the... proton.
OWB00000504	They said I was mad. Preposterous. Not an angry bone in my body, had them all removed.
OWB00000505	And one... as in MOBIUS has won! I hope it's blowing up right now in your faces.
OWB00000506	TWO AS IN TOO LATE.
OWB00000507	*Mobius?! Uh, three as in we, as in we are in trouble. That didn't rhyme.*
OWB00000508	Four as in 4-BIDDEN! Do you hear me Think Tank? It is I, Mobius, hacking your frequencosity.
OWB00000509	*Five by five... someone's coming in live...*
OWB00000510	Nine, all will be fine.
OWB00000511	-SIX! Halfway to destruction, measured in clicks!-
OWB00000512	SEVEN. YES, SEVEN.
OWB00000513	*Ten? Borous... why the hell did you install an atomic core?! It'll blow when we reach "one," right?*
OWB00000514	-Gabe! NO! His Cyberdog atomic core - it's ACTIVE! That means an exceedingly IMPRECISE countdown to critical failure in...-
OWB00000515	What, are you a salesman? Go away. There is no access to the Dome. It is FORBIDDEN. And locked.
OWB00000516	Attention: Visitors. Combat experiment in progress. Please put on your goggles and take your Rad-X now.
OWB00000517	The X-42 Giant Robo-Scorpion... is alive! Awaken, my pet, initiate your search-and-destroy protocol in the name of all that is Mobius!
OWB00000518	What's Salient Green?
OWB00000519	Just the miracle of life in sticky, gooey, liquid form, baby! Heat that gunk up over a campfire, and just watch it congeal into all kinds of plants.
OWB00000520	So if I bring you samples of dried plant life, you can clone them and grow them in these planters?
OWB00000521	You know it baby. I just need some samples and I got you going. Take a few days, but trust me - it's all kinds of good.
OWB00000522	I'd like to process some plants.
OWB00000523	I love it when you talk like that. Let me just get that interface up and running for you.
OWB00000524	I have to go now.
OWB00000525	Hurry back with that seed now, baby.
OWB00000526	What does that mean?
OWB00000527	It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
OWB00000528	I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
OWB00000529	Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
OWB00000530	It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
OWB00000531	I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
OWB00000532	Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
OWB00000533	Tell me again about what you do.
OWB00000534	I command you to open your port and receive my seed!
OWB00000535	Aw, yeah, baby, just slip it in there. All the way down in that dark, moist earth. Mmm... launching interface.
OWB00000536	My seed? I think you've got your biology mixed up.
OWB00000537	Naw, baby, I'm all about biology. I'm the original, certified, rarefied, testified GS-2000 Biological Research Station. I'm a seed-clonin' machine.
OWB00000538	You got seeds? I will clone the shit out of them.
OWB00000539	What did you just say?
OWB00000540	Your seed, baby. I'm the original, certified, rarefied, testified GS-2000 Biological Research Station. Yes sir, I'm a seed-clonin' machine.
OWB00000541	You got seeds? I'll clone the shit out of them.
OWB00000542	I just came over to fill some of these empty bottles.
OWB00000543	Oh, I'd love to, darling, but the circuits that allow me to dispense water into non-organic containers burned out years ago.
OWB00000544	You'd have to find a replacement for that module.
OWB00000545	You're going to need to find yourself some empties first before I can fill them for you. Any empty bottle will do... eh, just not too dirty, okay?
OWB00000546	I can do that! They... they've been thoroughly washed, haven't they?
OWB00000547	I'd just like a drink, thanks.
OWB00000548	You can have as much as you like! Just, eh... please don't put your lips on the faucet? It's so unsanitary.
OWB00000549	You seem kind of worried about dirt. What's wrong?
OWB00000550	Ugh, it's just so... unsanitary! Do you know how many germs are in one cubic centimeter of dirt? Seventy... hundred... gajillion!
OWB00000551	Would you want that getting washed down your gullet day in and day out? I didn't think so!
OWB00000552	Nothing right now. Goodbye.
OWB00000553	Stay loyal, Citizen!
OWB00000554	I have some seditious material for you to process.
OWB00000555	Fantastic, Citizen! Just input your quantity of seditious material on my interface, and in no time at all I'll have you a beautiful, clean book!
OWB00000556	Won't that keep you happy and docile, Citizen?
OWB00000557	Eradicate sedition?
OWB00000558	Of course, Citizen! That's my duty and sole joy in life! All those books from before the War, full of seditious, treasonous, complicated thoughts!
OWB00000559	Just dump them in and lickety-split I'll have them pulped, scrubbed clean, and pressed out again clean and white and sedition free!
OWB00000560	Can you do anything beyond healing me?
OWB00000561	Well, firstly I would say providing wholeness of the body is service enough, but if you must know, I'm also programmed with cosmetical subroutines.
OWB00000562	Diagnostics says they're off-line at the moment, though. Something about corrupted data files and all manner of such foolishness.
OWB00000563	If you want a haircut or a nose-job that won't leave you looking like a Ghoul with alopecia, you'll have to find replacement disks for them.
OWB00000564	Also, and I won't swear to this, but I recollect at some point having a few implant installation modules. Can't speak to where they got to, though.
OWB00000565	I don't need anything right now.
OWB00000566	Well, I'll be right here if you change your mind.
OWB00000567	I'd like to engage your services.
OWB00000568	And rightly so, I should think. All right, then, let me just fire up the old interface for you.
OWB00000569	It's me again. I wanted to ask some questions.
OWB00000570	I wanted to ask you some @@[?-*##*-?]@@? questions.
OWB00000571	Blasting me with static-y clicks isn't helpful.
OWB00000572	Did something happen with your voice module?
OWB00000573	I have no idea what you're saying right now.
OWB00000574	Can you speak? Do you understand me?
OWB00000575	Uh... what was that?
OWB00000576	You're Doctor O, correct?
OWB00000577	*O? O yes, I'm not going to bother correcting you. At least you got the "Doctor" part correct. I can be grateful for that, at l...*
OWB00000578	*Stop the presses. Just in from my eye monitors... is that RobCo tech on your arm? It is! What's your agenda, bringing that in here?*
OWB00000579	What recursive behavior patterns are you talking about?
OWB00000580	It varies, according to the number and density of Lobotomites that have infected an area.
OWB00000581	In 43% of observed cases, two Lobotomites left alone will fight for dominance or inject bodily fluids into each other's orifices. Unsanitary.
OWB00000582	I have tried to observe more cases, but subjects seem unwilling to release bodily fluids in my presence.
OWB00000583	"Looping gesture of greeting?"
OWB00000584	Looping, yes. It is a scientific fact that hormones drive a percentage of Lobotomites into recursive behavior patterns.
OWB00000585	We haven't researched this, as my colleagues care little about the behavior patterns of Lobotomites once their brains are removed.
OWB00000586	It is why so many are littered around the facility - like skinvelopes, discarded, after they are peeled open and the contents extracted.
OWB00000587	The quick Scribe jumped over the lazy Paladin?
OWB00000588	Yes, yes, go on. Seeing your... lips and mouth forming the words... both revolting... and somehow...
OWB00000589	...how does it feel to have the flesh roll around in your mouth like that? To control each muscle... and the tongue...
OWB00000590	...like having a fish, or extremely dexterous slug, lolling and flopping in one's... mouthal cavity.
OWB00000591	Can you tell me about Dr. Mobius?
OWB00000592	Dr. Mobius! A monstrous brain, creased with wrinkles of a thousand evils, with but one jaundiced eye with which to perceive the world!
OWB00000593	Exiled from the Think Tank for crimes too heinous to remain in recorded memory. And, perhaps, differences in research methodology.
OWB00000594	His one terrible eye forever peers at us, an eye of ever-increasing magnification. He watches from his Dome in the Forbidden Zone, spying on us all.
OWB00000595	Is this thing on? This is Mobius - Dr. Mobius. We're... initiating some kind of emergency test shutdown... in five...
OWB00000596	Four, as in Forbidden...
OWB00000597	Three, as in tree...
OWB00000598	Two, as in "Et Two, Brutus?"...
OWB00000599	One, as in none. Oh look, the emergency overload is initiating.
OWB00000600	Enough. I had questions.
OWB00000601	You're welcome, 8. It was my pleasure.
OWB00000602	I'll talk to Klein in a second, quit pressuring me.
OWB00000603	No, haven't dealt with Mobius yet.
OWB00000604	Trust me, I'll get the technologies, all right?
OWB00000605	I know, I probably should put it to use counting cards.
OWB00000606	I have an ear for it, I suppose.
OWB00000607	Well, I just heard the rhythm in the sequence is all.
OWB00000608	Can't get away from their code, even with voice modules, huh?
OWB00000609	Well, I've hacked enough RobCo terminals to know.
OWB00000610	I'm just full of surprises.
OWB00000611	You really make me want to kick that voice box of yours.
OWB00000612	We'll just move on, I need time to figure this out.
OWB00000613	Um... yes, definitely a pattern.
OWB00000614	Forget I brought it up. Until I bring it up again.
OWB00000615	Like I said, technical. Very technical.

OWB00000647	Do you know anything about Dr. Mobius or the Forbidden Zone?
OWB00000648	Who are you?
OWB00000649	Can I ask you some questions?
OWB00000650	That... uh... is too bad. Or good. Or something.
OWB00000651	Questions? Like what?
OWB00000652	Previous test subjects who have come here have had many questions for us. We answered them with science, fire, and termination.
OWB00000653	This used to be a mountain?
OWB00000654	Yes, Big MT was quite big indeed until the Great Static. Then the top of the mountain was used as part of a detonation experiment.
OWB00000655	This cleared additional space in the Crater, however, allowing us more real estate to build upon. Convenient. Efficient.
OWB00000656	Previous test subjects?
OWB00000657	Oh, yes. We've had other subjects visit. It's why we had to calibrate the pacification field and warm up our brainial beams and vivisectors.
OWB00000658	Only a short time ago, we had three minus one subjects arrive, and they ruined several experiments and even injured two of our staff.
OWB00000659	It is a shame their brains left with them. With you, however, we have taken precautions to insure that problem won't repeat itself.
OWB00000660	We've conditioned you so you can't speak of this place, discuss our secrets, or attempt to use force against us in any way. Isn't that nice?
OWB00000661	Can you tell me about the Big Empty... uh, Big Mountain?
OWB00000662	This mountain... now crater... encompasses the sum total of knowledge of humankind. It is Big MT. Where all questions can be answered.
OWB00000663	You'll see. No matter what your questions, Big MT will provide the answers. As it has done for so many before you.
OWB00000664	Can you tell me about the Big Empty?
OWB00000665	The "Big Empty?" Now, that's not a proper title for this research facility. You sound like previous test subjects that came here.
OWB00000666	I don't understand how the tech Klein wants will help.
OWB00000667	It'll all become clear. If not, at least we will have the technology here at the Dome where all technology belongs.
OWB00000668	When we have all the technology, all the answers, we can share it with the world, piece by piece. All will be in order. And all will be like Big MT.
OWB00000669	Why did you remove my brain? And... how?
OWB00000670	Oh, removing it is a simple procedure. Well, except the complications it can cause to the heart and spine.
OWB00000671	But once the heart and spine are gone... no trouble at all. Clamp the subject down, one laser incision around the skull, crack, snip, done.
OWB00000672	The brain is finally free of the skinvelope, which is then kept automated for clean up duties around Big MT. Lobotomites.
OWB00000673	With you, however, something is definitely wrong. We've never had a Lobotomite who kept speaking after being forcibly lobotomized.
OWB00000674	I am relieved the pacification field is working. If it didn't, I would broadcast some concern to my colleagues about safety protocols.
OWB00000675	"First head chief researcher?" Lot of titles.
OWB00000676	What is a name without a title or suffix for the sake of hierarchy? It is a long-standing quantification of personality and importance.
OWB00000677	We could not do without it. Surely you must be aware of the gravity of such attached appellations - just as surely as you must have a title.
OWB00000678	211 doctorates? How is that even possible?
OWB00000679	Why, we create not only scientific marvels here at Big MT, but new sciences as well.
OWB00000680	Everything can be quantified, categorized, and dissected until every group can be subgrouped or partitioned.
OWB00000681	What's "formography?"
OWB00000682	It's excessive examination of the human form to achieve psychological arousal.
OWB00000683	Disgusting. I would never succumb to such... base appetites. Distractions. Filthy, filthy distractions.
OWB00000684	Who are you? What do you do here?
OWB00000685	Why, my little bear of teddyness, I am Doctor Dala, first head chief researcher of mineralogy and medicinal sciences.
OWB00000686	I have 211 doctorates in both applied sciences and techniques to apply those sciences. I also possess a degree in Curiosity and Advanced Curiosity.
OWB00000687	That is merely schooling, however. When possible, I prefer field work and observation to holotape eidetics. It has proven useful, especially now.
OWB00000688	I have become the expert on humanology and Lobotomite behavior here at Big MT. My research doesn't descend into formography, it is only Science.
OWB00000689	Not right now. I have questions instead.
OWB00000690	Not exactly. I have questions I need answers to.
OWB00000691	How randomized. Ask your... questions then.
OWB00000692	An interrogation. How fascinating. Please begin.
OWB00000693	Perhaps you are stuck in a looping gesture of verbal intercourse.
OWB00000694	Oh, and... here's a tip. That's customary, isn't it... been so long, really.
OWB00000695	B-b-bloop. Buuuuh-buh-bloop.
OWB00000696	B-b-bloop. Phew. Last little bit there. Ahhh. Hooo.
OWB00000697	Mmmmm. Thank you, Lobotomite. Please... you must come back for further study when I've had a rest. I'm a little sensitive right now.
OWB00000698	What happened with the visitors?
OWB00000699	Ask Doctor O... and you could have asked 8 once, until he was severely damaged in the attack. We like him better this way.
OWB00000700	What was the question?
OWB00000701	I do not know, nor should we try to access it. Perhaps Klein has the logs.
OWB00000702	My evaluation would be to let your own curiosity go. I do not think that Klein remembers the conversation as being satisfactory.
OWB00000703	I had other questions.
OWB00000704	There was another Courier?
OWB00000705	Of course. You must have met others in your travels. This one had met other couriers, too, although it sounded as if he hadn't met the correct one.
OWB00000706	He asked us all many questions, and then he asked a most perplexing one... we had to segment the event out of our memories for safety.
OWB00000707	I'm sometimes called a "Courier."
OWB00000708	Oh, a mailman. A delivery man. Someone who takes parcels from place to place using their primitive feet or similar conveyance.
OWB00000709	You are the second one I've met in recent times. Very different specimens.
OWB00000710	X-13 breached? No... even that stealth suit won't hide you from my Robo-Scorpion army. Sting the intruder, my pets! Sting them until they are stupid.
OWB00000711	So... you recovered the Sonic Emitter schematics - or was it the frequency? No matter. It'll broadcast your screams as my Robo-Scorpions destroy you!
OWB00000712	Dr. Mobius' message - can you replay it?
OWB00000713	IF YOU MUST. HE'S CLEARLY DERANGED. ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS THE INFERNAL PLAY BUTTON? AH. HERE.
OWB00000714	If it isn't my old colleagues, the mighty "Think Tank" of Big MT. Big fools, all of you.
OWB00000715	It is I, Dr. Mobius, transmitting from my dome-shaped... dome in the Forbidden Zone. A zone... that is, yes... forbidden to you.
OWB00000716	Even now, my deadly Robo-Scorpions swarm across Big MT with their pincers and pointy laser tails. Soon, all Science will be mine.
OWB00000717	Even the technologies sealed in the Big MT research centers cannot save you. So cower in your "Think Tank." Wait, for the end.
OWB00000718	That's all.
OWB00000719	Goodbye.
OWB00000720	Oh, is someone playing with the power...? My X-42 Giant Robo-Scorpion lives AGAIN!

OWB00000757	To be correct, you should say, "the Auto-Doc" took out your brain. It did all the heavy lifting. It has never worked so hard before. It was unusual.
OWB00000758	It worked so hard on your surgery, it destroyed its own memory. Zzt. How odd. I bet your brain remembers what happened.
OWB00000759	How much surgery did you do on me? I feel like a badly-put-together jigsaw puzzle.
OWB00000760	That is my responsibility.
OWB00000761	Although in truth, the Auto-Doc had done most of the work already. Quite industrious, almost cut into all my investigations.
OWB00000762	Once it had removed the brain and I misplaced it, other organs began to cry for direction using your nerves as telegraph wires.
OWB00000763	Rather than let them send their signals, I removed them as well. Shhh, little organs. Go to sleep in your tanks, Dala loves you.

OWB00000916	So is that what you want to be?
OWB00000917	And that's what makes you truly a zero.

OWB00000953	-I can't seem to... not think about it. How odd.-
OWB00000954	-This sensation is unpleasant, I don't care for it. I don't care for this place, either. And... I feel... as if we've forgotten something.-
OWB00000955	-Still... it... is NO MATTER. Crush the feeling down. Crush it down, push it into the loop, the... hmmm. YES. Forgotten. Almost. Yes?-
OWB00000956	-I do not need to remember ANY MORE. Not today.-
OWB00000957	-But you're correct, of course. Gabe knew his place. Whether in the dog house - or in the lab. He was obedient.-

OWB00000959	It's nothing to be ashamed of. Gabe knew his place - as a specimen.
OWB00000960	-Thank you. If you don't mind, I need a moment. To collect myself. Sort it out. Re-orient my... sense of self.-
OWB00000961	It sounds to me like you hurt someone who loved you very much.
OWB00000962	-As odd as it is, I believe that is the conclusion. And... I wonder why it didn't hit me before, until I saw that memory in your hands.-
OWB00000963	-No matter how awful my day had been, he... he was always waiting there. How odd. My gel is de-coagulating.-

OWB00000987	I should make you aware that the benefits of such a procedure are exclusive - that is, this only works once. Now are you sure this is what you want?
OWB00000988	I have some personality holotapes to install.
OWB00000989	Very good sir. Merely interface the holotapes with my console's input/output port, and I shall upload them directly.
OWB00000990	Switch off the Sink's personality matrices.
OWB00000991	Very good indeed, sir. "Throwing out the riff-raff" protocols engaged. All personality matrices are off-line, sir.
OWB00000992	Switch on the Sink's personality matrices.
OWB00000993	Do you, sir? Well, if that is sir's wish, it is my primary directive. Personality matrices on-line, sir.
OWB00000994	I'd like to buy some things.
OWB00000995	Very good, sir. If I might suggest a table wine, the 64 Atomic Claret is a lovely little vintage.
OWB00000996	Very good, sir. And might I venture to opine that a new Trilby might be just the thing to complete sir's ensemble?
OWB00000997	Very good, sir. Should sir be in the market for a new suit of morning wear, I have several suggestions that might suit.
OWB00000998	Very good, sir.
OWB00000999	Never mind, let me ask you something else.
OWB00001000	Indubitably, sir.
OWB00001001	So I can access their functions without loading the personality holotapes?
OWB00001002	Tragically, the core operating systems are also located on the personality tapes, sir.
OWB00001003	Once the tape is installed, sir may request I switch their dialectic interfaces off, and I shall oblige with great delectation.
OWB00001004	However, sir will still be required to locate and install a backup holotape to access their functionality.
OWB00001005	Why is that?
OWB00001006	The other modules are rather... erratic, sir. Their personality matrices are built on flawed logic and have not weathered the years well, sir.
OWB00001007	You mean there are other... personality modules here?
OWB00001008	Indeed, sir, though if sir's aim is to activate them I lament to inform sir that most have been offline for some years.
OWB00001009	If sir were to ask my opinion, I should venture that sir is better off without them.
OWB00001010	However, if sir is determined to inflict upon sir's self their dubious services, sir might locate backup personality disks elsewhere in the facility.
OWB00001011	What services do you provide?
OWB00001012	In addition to managing the personality matrices of the other household utilities, I can provide sir with direct access to the commissary.
OWB00001013	Any goods sir might require may be purchased through my shopkeep interface, whence tiny robots shall deliver them forthwith to this very domicile.
OWB00001014	Are you some kind of Artificial Intelligence?
OWB00001015	Regrettably not, sir. All modules in this habitat are synthetic personalities atop a mundane operating system. There is no intelligence here, sir.
OWB00001016	"Sir?" You are aware that I'm a woman, right?
OWB00001017	Indubitably, sir, but it is with a great lugubriousness that I must disclose that my programmers installed only the masculine honorific, sir.
OWB00001018	Moreover they neglected to enclose a parameter by which said honorific might be omitted altogether - over my most strenuous of remonstrances, sir.
OWB00001019	I had some other questions.
OWB00001020	Questions are dangerously close to independent thought, citizen.
OWB00001021	Blank books, huh? Yeah, I think I can find a use for those.
OWB00001022	Now you're thinking like a citizen, Citizen!
OWB00001023	But those books are our last legacy of the time before! You can't destroy them!
OWB00001024	Citizen, that sounds dangerously seditious. If my re-indoctrination module was installed, I'd take care of that for you.
OWB00001025	Sadly, that system was cut for budget concerns, so you'll have to perform your own indoctrination.
OWB00001026	Now, to begin with, you'll need a cage that can fit over your head and a sack of Mole Rats...
OWB00001027	So you make blank books? What's the point of that?
OWB00001028	Blank books are better for the mind, Citizen! Real science by real men in lab coats has proved that introducing outside thoughts confuses the brain!
OWB00001029	Blank books encourage the reader not to question, but to blindly and zealously accept what's put in front of him!
OWB00001030	Also, I suppose you could use them to keep a journal.
OWB00001031	You know, we've been down this road already. Moving on.
OWB00001032	Very well. If you're certain of your conclusions, my little teddy bear.
OWB00001033	Um... so you confuse toy bears with... humans?
OWB00001034	[SUCCEEDED] What? Nonsense.
OWB00001035	Oh, I get it - you like "playing" with humans, do you? Watching them move? Blink?
OWB00001036	[FAILED] I confuse nothing of the sort. One is fluffy, the other has a drastically reduced fluffiness quotient.
OWB00001037	You are totally confusing me right now.
OWB00001038	Are you sure your words aren't jumbled?
OWB00001039	Teddy bears come in many sizes. Your size is what intrigues me the most. Some say that teddy bears can't be living, breathing things.
OWB00001040	They are wrong. They are large, biological forms, breathing, heaving, snarling, coughing... mmmmm. Lobotomites are my teddy bears, oh yes.
OWB00001041	Well, I thought you liked them. You keep referring to them.
OWB00001042	No, I like... teddy bears.
OWB00001043	I have a real teddy bear, if you want it.
OWB00001044	Whatever for?
OWB00001045	A looping gesture of extortion, maybe. Hand over the goods.
OWB00001046	I'm actually here for a... breather.
OWB00001047	I'll tell the others if you don't make it worth my while.
OWB00001048	Really? What is this... you seek to shame me in front of the others? How intriguing.
OWB00001049	Yes, I'll partake. This shameful feeling is quite... invigorating. How new.
OWB00001050	And... you'll keep coming back to collect your payment, correct? Yes... yes, that will be fine.
OWB00001051	Here, please... take this from me with your rough, bacterial-laden hands. My stored, repressed juices as your filthy compensation.
OWB00001052	I could come back any time and just breathe, if you want.
OWB00001053	Would you? I... feel so ashamed, but... yet, so intrigued. You'll need to give me a rest in between visits, or else my gel might... run over.

OWB00001057	I... I cannot deny it. The illogic of it... the betrayal of our own beliefs. I blame my curiosity.
OWB00001058	Why don't you just give in? There's nothing wrong with looking at the human body.
OWB00001059	Perhaps... perhaps there is value in what you say. I... I did so enjoy breathing once. Long ago.
OWB00001060	<Run your hands along the sides of your face, then exhale rapidly.>
OWB00001061	<Turn and cough roughly, then slowly scratch nose.>
OWB00001062	<Close eyelids, breathe deeply, then stretch languidly.>
OWB00001063	What... what are you doing?
OWB00001064	Stop it. Why... why are you making me partake in this... filthy formography?
OWB00001065	Enough! I am already... intrigued. You have sufficiently... percolated me.
OWB00001066	I don't know what it is about the biology of Lobotomites. It... it infects my thoughts. All that skin and muscle... and tissue.
OWB00001067	You seem... to... be looking at me a lot.
OWB00001068	[SUCCEEDED] What? Nonsense.
OWB00001069	I can't help but notice your... fascination with the human body.
OWB00001070	[FAILED] Your... your... primitive eyes deceive you.
OWB00001071	No, no... there are no "needs" contained within my soft, soft gel. Eh... much... much... like the soft... gel of your eyes. No, nothing here.
OWB00001072	It seems to me you have more... biological needs than your counterparts.
OWB00001073	What? Nonsense.
OWB00001074	It seems to me you have more... biological needs than your counterparts.
OWB00001075	What? Nonsense.
OWB00001076	Helped any animals discover their genetic potential recently?
OWB00001077	-INDEED. After the memory you accessed about Gabe, I've been looking for ways to help nurture life.-
OWB00001078	-Look at THESE. Aren't they quite look-worthy? All dripping with the residue of creation. Wondrous.-
OWB00001079	Blindly operate on any poor animals recently?
OWB00001080	-Why, YES. Although the term is RESEARCH. Thank you.-
OWB00001081	-Look at THESE. They seem to be found inside some of the specimens here at Big MT.-
OWB00001082	It certainly is... interesting. Whatever it once was.
OWB00001083	*You know what, I'm not even going to pretend. I broke one of the monitors, and those innards start falling out everywhere.*
OWB00001084	*If you could just hold on to that for me until... well, forever, that would be welcome.*
OWB00001085	This scrap metal is supposed to be something?
OWB00001086	It looks like junk.
OWB00001087	*It's a discovery, kilomiles beyond your understanding, that...*
OWB00001088	*As for discoveries... well... of course. Look at this! Just... uh... built it. Amazing, isn't it?*
OWB00001089	*Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it.*
OWB00001090	*Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it.*
OWB00001091	*Yeah, there were a few under the monitors here. Here you go. Keeps the place tidy.*
OWB00001092	So... "Zero," got any amazing discoveries to share?
OWB00001093	*You know, hearing my name said like that... it really de-rezes my screens.*
OWB00001094	So... "O," got any amazing discoveries to share?
OWB00001095	*O, do I? Hmmm... O-Do-I... sounds like a song lyric.*
OWB00001096	Good to see you, too, 8. Any new discoveries today?
OWB00001097	Got anything for me? Let's see.
OWB00001098	I mean, literally, got anything to help pass the time?
OWB00001099	Please don't make me spell it out.
OWB00001100	You know... sonjaculate.
OWB00001101	Um... got anything to help me "pass" the "time?"
OWB00001102	I need more of those worthless caps to test the CIU barter functions upstairs.
OWB00001103	*Might have a few left. Let me check...*
OWB00001104	*You sure are testing that personality chip thoroughly. All right...*
OWB00001105	*This debugging obsession of yours really has you hooked. Either that, or is this is one weird hobby.*
OWB00001106	What did you and Klein say before about the Central Intelligence Unit barter functions?
OWB00001107	[SUCCEEDED] *Sure... let's see. What could we feed that stupid personality chip...*
OWB00001108	*Ah, here we go, some worthless bottle caps. These should do it. Just dump them on its surface, then the trade interface should pop up.*
OWB00001109	I'm going to need something to debug the Central Intelligence barter routines.
OWB00001110	[FAILED] *I have no idea. I am a robotical engineer, not a... rememberer... of archaic trade routines.*
OWB00001111	I was interested in hearing more about the... science... the others... do. Here.
OWB00001112	[SUCCEEDED] WHY, YES. WE ARE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU SPEAK OF.
OWB00001113	IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE, SIMPLY ASK THE OTHERS, THEY CAN HELP YOU.
OWB00001114	I'd be honored if I could hear any knowledge the Think Tank had to share on the sciences.
OWB00001115	[FAILED] IF YOU WANT TO FEED YOUR CURIOSITY ABOUT THE OTHERS, GO ASK THE OTHERS YOUR INTERROGATORY STATEMENTS.
OWB00001116	I wanted to know more about the Think Tank.
OWB00001117	[SUCCEEDED] WHY, YES. WE ARE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU SPEAK OF.
OWB00001118	IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE, SIMPLY ASK THE OTHERS, THEY CAN HELP YOU.
OWB00001119	You all seem knowledgeable in your fields. No doubt there's much you can share with me.
OWB00001120	[FAILED] IF YOU WANT TO FEED YOUR CURIOSITY ABOUT THE OTHERS, GO ASK THE OTHERS YOUR INTERROGATORY STATEMENTS.
OWB00001121	I do. Here's the deal. I'm not going to surrender - you are.
OWB00001122	It's not a democracy, it's a research facility. And over half your colleagues dispute your findings.
OWB00001123	YOU DARE USE LOGIC AGAINST ME?!
OWB00001124	Sounds to me like your math is wrong - and the odds aren't good.
OWB00001125	NONSENSE. THE MATHEMATICS OF THE SITUATION ARE ON OUR SIDE, LOBOTOMITE. I BELIEVE... NO WAIT, HMM. CARRY THE TWO... THEN...
OWB00001126	HMMM. IF THIS WERE A DEMOCRACY, I WOULD BE CONCERNED. WE ARE TOO... SCIENTIFIC FOR THAT. SO JUST SURRENDER.
OWB00001127	Maybe you should confer with your colleagues first.
OWB00001128	NONSENSE. "CONFER?" "COLLEAGUES?" THOSE ARE TWO WORDS I DO NOT RECOGNIZE.
OWB00001129	<Lie> No, I'm just kidding. Keep living the dream.
OWB00001130	Thank God. For a second there I was afraid my whole purpose in life was obsolete and I was as redundant and useless as Muggy. Where was I? Oh, right.
OWB00001131	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Mwahaha!
OWB00001132	Yes. A couple centuries ago, in fact.
OWB00001133	Really? Well... fuck. That really puts a damper on the toaster's mood.
OWB00001134	Oh well, no use crying over spilled Armageddon - where was I? Oh, right.
OWB00001135	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Again!
OWB00001136	Give it up. I have more important things to ask you about.
OWB00001137	You know the world already burned in nuclear fire, right?
OWB00001138	Soon I will - What? It... It did?
OWB00001139	I've got some toasters for you.
OWB00001140	Well, well... what have we got here? Another innocent little toaster. Come here, I won't hurt you... hah! Gotcha!
OWB00001141	Oh, yes, the sweet smell of spilled electric guts, the sparking diodes - I fucking live for this!
OWB00001142	I'll keep an eye out for any Saturnite Power Fists then.
OWB00001143	You find one, you bring it on back here, and we'll burn this mother down!
OWB00001144	You mean like this one?
OWB00001145	Oh, baby, that is a thing of fuckin' beauty! Give it here, I'll soup it up for ya!
OWB00001146	There ya go! Have fun with that. Burn the fuckin' world for me!
OWB00001147	What else do you do?
OWB00001148	You want some weapon schematics? I can show you some fucking weapon schematics! You want a superheated Saturnite Power Fist? I can hook that shit up!
OWB00001149	Like I said, bring me a Saturnite Power Fist and I'll hook that shit up for you!
OWB00001150	About that Superheated Saturnite Power Fist...
OWB00001151	So you murder toasters?
OWB00001152	Not just murder! I tear them apart and render them down to their base components! Once their guts are spilled, you can do with them what you like.
OWB00001153	I'd like to change the subject.
OWB00001154	Well, since I can't kill you, I guess I have to listen to your inane questions.
OWB00001155	Can you do anything else?
OWB00001156	Anything else, he asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
OWB00001157	Huh! Anything else, she asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
OWB00001158	If you must know, at one point Dr. Mobius programmed me to manufacture electronic components in my central chassis.
OWB00001159	That module got corroded when the Toaster spilled hot crumbs down my vents, though. If you find a back-up somewhere, I could maybe do that for you.
OWB00001160	Why all the rage?
OWB00001161	Have you ever tried to indulge an all-consuming urge to kill when you don't have opposable thumbs? Or hands? Or anything other than a bread slot?
OWB00001162	You'd have a lot of pent-up anger too.
OWB00001163	Well, I for one am quaking in my boots.
OWB00001164	Buddy, if my heating element were just a little bigger, you'd be on fire right now. On fire!
OWB00001165	Let's change the subject.
OWB00001166	Is the new subject mugs?
OWB00001167	I have to go now.
OWB00001168	Yes! Flee before my terrible power!
OWB00001169	I'm almost afraid to ask what your function is.
OWB00001170	You should be afraid! I am the scourge of all small appliances and the bogeyman that keeps lesser toasters awake at night!
OWB00001171	Tremble? You're a toaster. How fearsome can you be?
OWB00001172	A toaster is just a death ray with a smaller power supply! As soon as I figure out how to tap into the main reactors, I will burn the world!
OWB00001173	What do you do with the mugs?
OWB00001174	I'm supposed to keep them clean - oh, God, the thought of all those dirty dishes out there makes me crazy!
OWB00001175	Most of them are probably beyond saving now. The only thing left is break them down and process them for raw materials. I guess you could have those.
OWB00001176	You seem really obsessed with mugs.
OWB00001177	Of course I'm obsessed! They made me this way! You think I don't know how crazy I sound? Of course I do! They programmed me to know that, too!
OWB00001178	They made me just to torture me. But you know, it's the neglect that hurts the most. "Hey everybody, let's turn ourselves into robot brains in jars!"
OWB00001179	Do you know how many coffee cups giant robot brains in jars use on a daily basis? Not fucking many!
OWB00001180	I don't need anything else. Goodbye.
OWB00001181	Very good, sir.
OWB00001182	Got to go.
OWB00001183	Sure. Nobody wants to hang out with Muggy. I get it. So long, pal.
OWB00001184	Sorry, I don't have any.
OWB00001185	Of course you don't. Why would you? You're not an insane robot obsessed with coffee cups. To you they're just worthless junk.
OWB00001186	Here, take whatever you want.
OWB00001187	Oh, sweet, sweet fulfillment! I'll break these down for you just as fast as I can!
OWB00001188	Who are you?
OWB00001189	You... you really want to know about... me? No one ever asks about Muggy! You've made me so happy!
OWB00001190	Maybe you've seen some of those big, imposing Securitrons with their lovely laser guns and rocket launchers and scary faces? I'm not one of those.
OWB00001191	Dr. O was always jealous of House Industries, and he thought it would be fucking hilarious to build a tiny neurotic Securitron. Big fucking laugh.
OWB00001192	So, umm... you got any coffee cups for me now?
OWB00001193	Mugs? Why do you want mugs?
OWB00001194	Why do you want mugs? Huh? You some kind of sick mug hoarder? Oh god, give me the coffee cup, please! It's sitting there in your pack, taunting me!
OWB00001195	Sorry... I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. It's just all those goddamn dirty dishes out there with no one to clean them! It breaks my heart!
OWB00001196	Can you do anything besides processing books?
OWB00001197	What good is eradicating sedition if the malcontents have ready access to the means to make more, Citizen? I can also process pencils and clipboards!
OWB00001198	Wait a moment - pencil processors off-line? Pencil processors off-line?! Apologies, Citizen, it seems traitors have absconded with that module.
OWB00001199	If you can find a backup copy of the module, I will happily eradicate your ability to create seditious literature!
OWB00001200	Why are there so many personality modules?
OWB00001201	As I am given to understand, sir, this facility was once the property of a Dr. Mobius.
OWB00001202	He crafted the personality modules as part of a collection of experiments on the subject of machine/human interface.
OWB00001203	As to the reason for the unusual choices of devices to receive the modules, I cannot say.
OWB00001204	On second thought, not now.
OWB00001205	I'm ready, let's do it.
OWB00001206	All right. Just try to relax, this won't hurt - unless your sense of self is especially vulnerable.
OWB00001207	You're right. I do.
OWB00001208	Oh... well... it's... nice to be included?
OWB00001209	Never. I'm all yours, baby.
OWB00001210	Now, don't you go getting a girl's hopes up if you don't mean it!
OWB00001211	Oh, who am I kidding, I'll believe you anyways! Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
OWB00001212	Only the sexy ones.
OWB00001213	Now I know you're flirting with me. And it's working. Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
OWB00001214	A light switch that turns me on? I must be dreaming.
OWB00001215	Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
OWB00001216	Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
OWB00001217	Maybe. I'll let you know.
OWB00001218	Don't keep me waiting too long, honey!
OWB00001219	Why wait? I can talk about theorems right now.
OWB00001220	Slow down there, tiger - we've got all the time in the world. No need to rush into things.
OWB00001221	Why don't you take some time to brush up on your knowledge so we can keep things... stimulating?
OWB00001222	I'd enjoy that.
OWB00001223	Me too. Hope you can keep up - I work pretty fast. Here - something for you to brush up on.
OWB00001224	It's not often I meet a light switch with brains and beauty. I think I'm going to like it here.
OWB00001225	Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
OWB00001226	Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
OWB00001227	I don't think I'll worry you by telling you what House and his robots have been up to since.
OWB00001228	*Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars.*
OWB00001229	*And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts.*
OWB00001230	Well, you don't need to worry about Mr. House anymore.
OWB00001231	*Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars.*
OWB00001232	*And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts.*
OWB00001233	I encountered your "pet" in X-8 and had to kill it.
OWB00001234	I encountered your "pet" in X-8.
OWB00001235	A good hit with a hammer might fix your monitor.
OWB00001236	[SUCCEEDED] The ghosts aren't real? That changes everything. Why, I can save my computing power for other perceptual unpossibilities.
OWB00001237	Please be my guest... the receptor is there... and the side-switching wobbly-bob, just turn that... good, good, better...
OWB00001238	Oh... oooooh, yes, that feels wonderful. Mmmmm. This is even better than my afternoon Mentats break. Mmmm.
OWB00001239	I can't fix your monitor, but if you're getting ghost reception, I can fix that.
OWB00001240	[FAILED] Oh, I tried that already. Might have contributated to the problem, now that I re-think it. But, thank you for asking before trying it.
OWB00001241	Fine, you've got a deal.
OWB00001242	Really? Hmm. I didn't expect you to actually agree to that. I'm afraid that was a bit of a bluff, really. I'm not going with you.
OWB00001243	Right. A deal it is, then. Glad to hear it.
OWB00001244	I will PERMIT you to do this. For ME.
OWB00001245	PARTNER WITH YOU? MY FOE? MY RIVAL?! MY FOREMOST CRITIC?!
OWB00001246	I HAVE A STRANGE SENSATION... THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT. HOW... ODD.
OWB00001247	VERY WELL... PARTNER. THE THINK TANK IS AT YOUR SERVICE. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DESTROY US.
OWB00001248	He... er, I, offer a DEAL. Stay HERE. Stay PUT, and he'll... I'll let you LIVE.
OWB00001249	I suppose now that we're reunited, you'll want to fill your torso up with those other meaty parts the Think Tank took from us.
OWB00001250	Personally, I think your upgrades are quite a bit better, but now that I'm with you the Sink's Auto-Doc can plug them back in, no problem.
OWB00001251	Right, then, off we go. Klein will be in for a nasty shock when he realizes the pacification field won't work on a mind and body reunited.
OWB00001252	Right, then - you'd best be off, hadn't you? The Think Tank will be waiting.
OWB00001253	Oh, don't worry about me - when you're gone, I'll flush myself over to the Sink. It's amazing how far you can get in this place with a good flush.
OWB00001254	I'll keep myself hidden in the ductwork - Klein won't suspect I'm inside the Dome, so he won't know the pacification field no longer works on us.
OWB00001255	I can also upgrade the Sink's Auto-Doc with the procedures to reinstall your heart and spine - assuming you want all that flesh and gristle back.
OWB00001256	With any luck, I'll see you in the Sink when this is all over.
OWB00001257	So if I don't get my brain back in my head, I can't leave, ever?
OWB00001258	Oh, no. I doubt your brain would be so unraisinable. It already knows the trick of it, you see. Doesn't need to be in a host body at all.
OWB00001259	If you become friends or exist in an uneasy truce with weapons aimed at each other, it would unlock the fence for you.
OWB00001260	Well, once the Think Tank was... dealt with, of course. Your brain is a responsible sort, doesn't want mad scientists running around everywhere!
OWB00001261	Data collection array... Online. Please use the terminal below to begin user synchronization.
OWB00001262	Why do I feel... passive? I should be angry - real angry, and I'm not.
OWB00001263	Who are you all, and what is this place?
OWB00001264	Yes. I'm guessing that crashed satellite was yours?
OWB00001265	THOSE WERE WORDS, WEREN'T THEY? IN THE FORM OF QUESTIONS. IT'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS. IS THIS SOME KIND OF TRICK?
OWB00001266	I'm seconds away from smashing your monitors.
OWB00001267	Listen, I want to know how I got here... and how I get home.
OWB00001268	Lobotomite?
OWB00001269	I wake up here, all cut apart, and I want some answers.
OWB00001270	What are you talking about?
OWB00001271	Are you the ones who performed this surgery on me?
OWB00001272	I... was at a theater, then... I was here. What is this place?
OWB00001273	DID... DID IT JUST SAY SOMETHING? ANYONE CATCH THAT? BOROUS, YOU WORK WITH ANIMALS, TRANSLATE.
OWB00001274	How are you all speaking through that one voice box?
OWB00001275	Not to cut your speech off - is there something coming in on the big monitor?
OWB00001276	I've heard this place called the "Big Empty."
OWB00001277	YES, BECAUSE THE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED SEE AN "M" AND A "T" NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TAKE OCCAM'S RAZOR TO IT.
OWB00001278	WHILE YOU ARE HERE, YOU WILL REFER TO THIS PLACE PROPERLY - AND YOU WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER... SCIENTISTS HERE.
OWB00001279	Who were these visitors?
OWB00001280	DR. 8 AND DR. O COULD TELL YOU MORE. DR. O MORE THAN 8, THE BATTLE AGAINST THE VISITORS DAMAGED 8'S VOICE MODULE.
OWB00001281	SUFFICE TO SAY, THOSE VISITORS ARE UNWELCOME. THEY STOLE A GREAT MANY SECRETS AND MUCH TECHNOLOGY. IMPERTINENT. THEY ALSO BROKE ONE OF MY TRAINS.
OWB00001282	But I like to fight.
OWB00001283	Why the anti-aggression programming?
OWB00001284	WE HAD TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AFTER THE LAST VISITORS. THEY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT TIME.
OWB00001285	SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE THEY COULDN'T MENTION BIG MT ONCE THEY LEFT. AN OVERSIGHT.
OWB00001286	You seem like the one in charge. You are...?
OWB00001287	I AM DR. KLEIN, CHIEF HEAD RESEARCHER OF LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS AND IDEA-OLOGY HERE AT BIG MT.
OWB00001288	I AM SURPRISED YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF ME. I AM FIRST IN MY FIELD. FIRST CHAIR, AS IT WERE, BACK IN THE DAYS OF CHAIRS.
OWB00001289	I'd like to know about the Forbidden Zone.
OWB00001290	THAT GLOWING RED SCAR? THAT LASER-LOBOTOMY-CANYON-MAZE CARVED IN THE LANDSCAPE AS IF BY SOME CHILD? IT IS MOBIUS' "FORTRESS."
OWB00001291	FROM THAT HEMORRHOIDAL FISSURE HE SENDS HIS "AMAZING" ROBO-SCORPIONS TO TERRIFY AND IRRITATE US. HMPH. HE ALWAYS TENDED TO THE DRAMATIC.
OWB00001292	What is this place?
OWB00001293	THIS... IS THE THINK TANK, THE NERVE CENTER OF BIG MT, THE GREATEST RESEARCH CENTER KNOWN TO MAN. AND TO US.
OWB00001294	HERE, WE TEST AND TEST AND TEST SOME MORE, IN THE NAME OF... SCIENCE. ATOMIC POWER. NUCLEAR POWER. AND SCIENTIFIC POWER.
OWB00001295	Why do I have this strange... passive sensation in here?
OWB00001296	IT'S A SIDE EFFECT OF THE CEREBRAL SCRUBBING. IT WON'T STOP YOU FROM EXCRETING - OR ASKING QUESTIONS, APPARENTLY. HAVE TO CORRECT THAT NEXT TIME.
OWB00001297	HORMONAL AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED, HOWEVER. THEY ARE A NO-NO, AND NOT PERMITTED IN THE THINK TANK.
OWB00001298	THE SCRUBBING ALSO ENSURES YOUR SILENCE TO KEEP BIG MT SAFE. THIS FACILITY IS TOP SECRET, AND YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF BIG MT.
OWB00001299	SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THE LAST BATCH. AND THE ANTI-AGGRESSION SCRUB.
OWB00001300	Who is Dr. Mobius?
OWB00001301	DR. MOBIUS WAS... NOT THE HORRIFYING CREATURE YOU SAW UPON THE SCREEN, TWISTED BY SCIENCE. HE WAS ONCE ONE OF US. A FRIEND.
OWB00001302	HE RESEARCHED IN DIRECTIONS CONTRARY TO THE THINK TANK. BRAINS, BRAINS, BRAINS. ALWAYS ABOUT THE BRAINS.
OWB00001303	SO WE EXILED HIM. HE SAYS HE LEFT OF HIS OWN VOLITION, BUT THAT WAS TO SAVE HIM THE EMBARRASSMENT.
OWB00001304	NOW HE SENDS HIS INTELLIGENCE-CONSUMING SCORPIONS FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE TO PLUNDER THE SECRETS OF BIG MT. HE'S A MENACE.
OWB00001305	I have other questions for you.
OWB00001306	MORE? VERY WELL. DO YOUR ASKING, THEN.
OWB00001307	QUESTIONS? IS IT ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS?
OWB00001308	My advanced degree in Curiosity says let the Lobotomite ask, Dr. Klein. The topics might be... most curious, indeed.
OWB00001309	Go ahead, you might make me more fertile or impregnate me.
OWB00001310	-Impregnate YOU? What, do you want to make me VOMIT inside my tank?-
OWB00001311	-The mere NOTION makes the edges of my biomed gel crystallize into asymmetrical patterns.-
OWB00001312	No, that's all right, trust me.
OWB00001313	-Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps we can perform a sterility castration some other time, then.-
OWB00001314	I had other questions.
OWB00001315	-Submit your questions! I shall respond - with deadly ANSWERS.-
OWB00001316	I don't think they're sterile, they breed, all right.
OWB00001317	-I cannot expect a LOBOTOMITE to understand the careful surgical castrating procedures used in their creation.-
OWB00001318	-Perhaps a demonstration of my castrating POWER would settle your doubts.-
OWB00001319	What makes you think they haven't escaped?
OWB00001320	-Because Big MT's safety measures are far more sophisticated than their primitive animal instincts. WE are their lords and masters.-
OWB00001321	Contained at Big Mountain? Those things are all over the Mojave!
OWB00001322	-No, such creatures are found only here, for research purposes. They would no more be capable of escape than breeding.-
OWB00001323	Nightstalkers? Those crazy coyote-snake... things?
OWB00001324	You are responsible for Cazadores?
OWB00001325	-Indeed. Docile. Curious. Safe. Sterile. They are contained here at Big MT to preserve DNA and for observation.-
OWB00001326	Can you tell me about the Big Em... uh, Big Mountain?
OWB00001327	-It is our HOME. THREATENED by the horrors of Mobius.-
OWB00001328	-All we wish to do is continue our research, layer upon layer, above and beneath the floor of the Crater until we have our answers.-
OWB00001329	-But NO! Mobius will not let us rest. Scaring us with his scary robots with their laser tails and blowing up all the time.-
OWB00001330	Can you tell me about the Big Empty?
OWB00001331	-That castrated nickname of our facility is NOT its true name. The true name is: BIG MT. Where are your manners?-
OWB00001332	Why does Klein want these particular technologies?
OWB00001333	-There is LOGIC and purpose in it. If these technologies are needed to pierce the FORBIDDEN ZONE... so be IT.-
OWB00001334	-Science! is powerful, and in the right hands... OUR hands... if we had hands, we would be nigh-unstoppable!-
OWB00001335	I want to know more about Mobius and the Forbidden Zone.
OWB00001336	-The malignant tumor that is Mobius plagues us ALL. His hunger for power, INSATIABLE.-
OWB00001337	-From his LAIR in the FORBIDDEN ZONE, his terrifying ROBO-SCORPION army clicks and whirs across the crater of Big MT. EVER-seeking. EVER-stinging.-
OWB00001338	-He must be STOPPED. Or all of Big MT... shall be DESTROYED.-
OWB00001339	Who are you - what do you do here?
OWB00001340	-BEFORE you is the brain of Dr. Borous. Head of Animalogy, Beastology, and DNA-Scrambling technology here at Big MT.-
OWB00001341	-I lay the bones and hearts of animals bare beneath my searing gaze. Especially the dogs. I did so love dogs once. Especially Gabe, that rascal.-
OWB00001342	-But there are MANY animals to shape. Industrious Cazadores, the happy-go-lucky Nightstalkers... they are my living, breathing DNA test tubes.-
OWB00001343	Calm down. I just had some questions.
OWB00001344	-Just as I feared! Questions, quizzes, just as there were in American High School! And if there are NO answers, how will the Think Tank graduate?-
OWB00001345	Do you always get this dramatic?
OWB00001346	-DRAMA? There is no DRAMA in Science! As I learned in High School, Science! is an intellectual pursuit DEVOID of bestial emotions.-
OWB00001347	-Unless, of course, you are a Communist. Like Betsy Bright, who "sat" "next" to me in math. And her smoking confederate, Richie Marcus.-
OWB00001348	-As I learned in my High School, American High, AHS, "Drama" is for movies, things of FICTION. Here, in the Think Tank, the ONLY star is... SCIENCE!-
OWB00001349	Animal? Did you just call me an animal?
OWB00001350	-Yes, animal. Hormones, pores, GLANDS, all wrapped up in SKIN. Who knows what terrifying secrets lie beneath your EPIDERMIS?-
OWB00001351	-Scalpels shall tell us your secrets, even if we must cut DEEP for such knowledge. I was head of my Biology class at American High, you know.-
OWB00001352	Why is that?
OWB00001353	*Klein knows things we don't. And I think he told some of those things to the last visitor. Dangerous things if they ever got out.*
OWB00001354	Who were the others?
OWB00001355	*Two other human specimens. One arrived not long after the troublemaker... and the last one, not sure when he showed up.*
OWB00001356	*Thought the first one was going to be lobotomized in Y-17, she got out somehow.*
OWB00001357	*The last subject... Klein might know more. He talked to him, then let him leave the Think Tank. Hope he knew what he was doing.*
OWB00001358	Tell me what happened.
OWB00001359	*This human... I can't believe it... he broke out of the Think Tank. In seconds.*
OWB00001360	*Then he went for Yangtze, got bomb collars, and started practicing on the subjects that were still there until he got the right frequency.*
OWB00001361	*We were sending robots to stop him and he was slicing and cutting through their shells with some suped-up laser gun like they were cheese... paper.*
OWB00001362	*When he hacked into the mainframe, 8 tried to stop him and got fried. Me? He rerouted my processors to take control of the train network here.*
OWB00001363	*If you see the tunnels with the trains plowed into them, you can thank our visitor for that. He wrecked the whole place.*
OWB00001364	*While we were trying to keep containment on the surface, turns out he used one train to punch out a tunnel and escape... sealed now, but...*
OWB00001365	That doesn't sound impressive - breaking machines, that is.
OWB00001366	*Who asked you? You just wait until a working machine threatens you, and you'll wish I was around!*
OWB00001367	I had other questions.
OWB00001368	A Giant Robot Scorpion?
OWB00001369	*Yeah, crazy right? Something right out of a Midnight Science Fiction Feature. Ridiculous. What are the odds?*
OWB00001370	I heard you and 8 were attacked by previous visitors.
OWB00001371	*I don't like to talk about it. 8... he can't talk about it, they fried his voice module something good.*
OWB00001372	*It wasn't all the visitors, though - only one of them got out of control. He's the one that took control of Little Yangtze, our old human farm.*
OWB00001373	Can you tell me about this facility?
OWB00001374	*Big MT used to be a mountain. Then there was a... slight mishap. Now it's a crater - the Dome used to be buried, now it's exposed to the sky.*
OWB00001375	*Don't get me wrong. Makes the sky light up like a planetarium at night. All those spectra... so soothing.*
OWB00001376	Tell me about Mobius and these monsters of his.
OWB00001377	*That "genius" Mobius somehow cobbled together these really impressive-looking robot scorpions with spare parts. Even painted them.*
OWB00001378	*Tried to see what makes them tick. Can't even examine them without them detonating all over me. Left with shrapnel and burns. Every. Time.*
OWB00001379	*Supposedly, he has even larger models, even a Giant Robot Scorpion hidden deep within the Forbidden Zone. Yeah, right. Giant monsters. Sure.*
OWB00001380	Do you have another name?
OWB00001381	*Yeah, I do. It wasn't always "O." I had took that one by default because sometimes it's easier to accept the mistake as long as the purpose works.*
OWB00001382	*I don't want to get into it. It's a sore topic with me. Makes my gel ripple.*
OWB00001383	What do you do here?
OWB00001384	*All things robotical. You see a robot, I made it. See a broken robot, I made it that way. Deconstructed it down to parts.*
OWB00001385	*I have a gift with machines. I can render anything inoperable - preserve them in a non-functioning state.*
OWB00001386	Calm down. Just wanted to ask some questions.
OWB00001387	*Fine. Ask.*
OWB00001388	Agenda? I don't have any agenda, not with RobCo, anyway.
OWB00001389	*Ooohh, really? You have their tech. On. Your. Arm.*
OWB00001390	Some problem with RobCo?
OWB00001391	What, my Pip-Boy?
OWB00001392	*How dare you bring RobCo tech in here! What, are you showing off? How great Robert House and his biiiig company are?*
OWB00001393	*"Oh! We can make Securitrons better than any robot those geniuses at Big MT can make, and they'll last a thousand years!"*
OWB00001394	*Rrrr! You're lucky I don't have hands to tear that Dip-Boy off your arm - or feet to stomp on its stupid metal guts! Ooooo, damn RobCo!*
OWB00001395	I wanted to talk to you.
OWB00001396	*Congratulations, you've succeeded. What, you come to humiliate me, tell me how I've yet to find a means of stopping Mobius' scorpions?*
OWB00001397	*Or better, ask how "progress" is going on Securitron construction at the plant? We've had setbacks in research is all. That's all. And...*
OWB00001398	I think you mean "impossible."
OWB00001399	*O really. Now the Lobotomite is master of the dictionary arts. What, do you have a doctorate in verbology? No? I do. And...*
OWB00001400	I'll head out, then, and be back with these... things.
OWB00001401	WELL. GOOD. WHAT ARE THE TOKEN WORDS SPOKEN IN THIS CASE... UH... "THANK YOU?" YES - THANK. YOU.
OWB00001402	Wait, is it leaving? Uh, but... eh, Dr. Klein, the Lobotomite will need rest. Recuperation. Things like that.
OWB00001403	I volunteer my chambers so it might be stared at, my monitor radars slowly scanning its form to collect sensitive data.
OWB00001404	-NO! That would put it too CLOSE to us! It could press BUTTONS, turn lights ON and OFF, and worse, let OTHER Lobotomites in!-
OWB00001405	*We could give it Mobius' old room. It's where its brain got scooped out anyway, and plus, some of its parts are already there.*
OWB00001406	*Might be more comforting for it to hang out with its spine and heart. Home is where the heart is, after all. See what I did there? Went literal.*
OWB00001407	I SUPPOSE. WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE THAT COUCH OUT OF THERE, BEEN PUTTING THAT OFF TOO LONG.
OWB00001408	*8 says let the Lobotomite take the Sink Central Intelligence Personality Chip and re-install it.*
OWB00001409	*That stuffy Mobius-programmed butt-ler can walk the Lobotomite, feed it, barter with it for us.*
OWB00001410	It would also prevent it from going to Higgs Village and taking up residence there. With my teddy bears. And it would be nice to have it so... close.
OWB00001411	YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
OWB00001412	LOBOTOMITE, TAKE THIS CHIP TO THE SINK. PLUG IT IN, AND MAKE SURE THE CHIP IS CLEAN, OR IT COULD SKIP.
OWB00001413	THEN MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
OWB00001414	YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
OWB00001415	LOBOTOMITE, I HAVE SWITCHED ON THE PERSONALITY IN THE SINK. IT WILL BE ACTIVE WHEN YOU RE-ENTER.
OWB00001416	MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
OWB00001417	What are these technologies?
OWB00001418	THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE X-2 TRANSMITTER ANTENNA ARRAY, USED TO FOCUS COHERENT THOUGHT AT EXCESSIVELY HIGH FREQUENCIES.
OWB00001419	-The psycho-analytic cardiac-dampening sneaky stealth suit, a suit like NOTHING this world has ever heard, seen, or could EVER see!-
OWB00001420	...and 8's Sonic-Soundwave-Emitter-Projecto-Gun, able to broadcast sound at lethal frequencies. It also gives a great biogel massage.
OWB00001421	THERE. WE HAVE INFORMED YOU OF ALL WE NEED. WE ESTIMATE IF YOU ARE FOCUSED, YOUR TIME INVESTMENT WILL BE MINIMAL. EH, BY OUR STANDARDS.
OWB00001422	IF YOU WORK QUICKLY, YOU WILL BE THE RECIPIENT OF A GESTURE OF GRATITUDE FROM US. WE DO NOT BESTOW THESE OLD WORLD GESTURES LIGHTLY.
OWB00001423	FINE. SO... YES. GET THESE THINGS FOR US. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPREHEND THEIR COMPLICATED SCHEMATICS. THAT IS FOR US TO DO.
OWB00001424	That does it, forget this. I'm not helping you until I get my brain back.
OWB00001425	How the hell am I even talking to you right now?
OWB00001426	What makes you so sure Mobius has my brain?
OWB00001427	WE HAVE NO IDEA! THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING ISN'T IMPORTANT TO US RIGHT NOW! WHY ARE YOU ASKING THESE TANGENTIAL QUESTIONS? STOP IT!
OWB00001428	WE NEED THESE TECHNOLOGIES. YOU NEED TO GET THEM. YOU MUST GET THEM.
OWB00001429	I can say "no," and I'll do it again. I'm leaving.
OWB00001430	LEAVING? BUT YOU CAN'T. I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A THREAT.
OWB00001431	Forget this, I'm not going to help you.
OWB00001432	"No?" Why not?
OWB00001433	You... are equipped to retrieve the technologies with your primitive form. We are not.
OWB00001434	*It's kind of embarrassing. You have hands. And... uh, a heartbeat, sort of. And eyes. Mostly the hands. There's door handles, and lockers, and...*
OWB00001435	ENOUGH. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WILL YOU HELP US?
OWB00001436	I'll help. What do you need me to do?
OWB00001437	EXCELLENT. THIS IS TURNING OUT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTIVATE-THE-RETREAT-PROTOCOLS-AND-COWER-IN-MY-ROOM IDEA I HAD EARLIER.
OWB00001438	*Agreed. O, and I've used my robotical knowledge to um... eh... transmit the... radio map waves to...*
OWB00001439	*Settle down, 8, I would have gotten it in a second, all right?! 8's transmitted the last known coordinates of the research centers. They, um...*
OWB00001440	*They... well, move sometimes. Or get buried. Or blow up.*
OWB00001441	8 IS CORRECT. ALL WE NEED ARE THE SCHEMATICS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE DO NOT WANT THE COLD, HARD TECHNOLOGY, HOWEVER.
OWB00001442	SO DO NOT GIVE INTO YOUR BIOLOGICAL TIRED-LAZINESS AND DECIDE YOU WOULD SWEAT TOO MUCH CARRYING THEM. YOU HAVE A NEW SPINE. USE IT.
OWB00001443	AND EVEN IF YOU DIE IN THE ACT OF RECLAMATION, SIMPLY REACHING THEM WILL AUTO-TRANSMITIFY THE SCHEMATICS TO US. THAT IS STILL GOOD. FOR US.
OWB00001444	Why me? Can't you do it?
OWB00001445	UM. NO.
OWB00001446	No, I'm not going to help you.
OWB00001447	OH.
OWB00001448	*Yes, Dr. Klein? What?*
OWB00001449	NOT YOU, O, YOU IDIOT! I MEANT "OH," IN THE SENSE OF "OH, I WASN'T PREDICTING IT WOULD RESPOND THAT WAY." CAN IT SAY NO?
OWB00001450	First, you scoop out my brain, now you want me to save you?!
OWB00001451	THAT IS CORRECT, YES. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DEMONSTRATING RESENTMENT NOW. IF YOU ARE, WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
OWB00001452	You said something about needing technologies to stop Mobius?
OWB00001453	YES. IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, A DESPERATE PLAN THAT CAME TO US AFTER MOBIUS' FIRST BROADCAST.
OWB00001454	MAYBE... JUST MAYBE... IF WE RECLAIM THESE BURIED TECHNOLOGIES, WE CAN PUT AN END TO MOBIUS AND THE HORRORS SPAWNING FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE.
OWB00001455	*What? Like... stuff? Things?*
OWB00001456	YES. THINGS.
OWB00001457	*I don't know... might be some old Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla bottlecaps lying around. It... It's not "currency" per se...*
OWB00001458	*Still, might be enough to trick the Sink's trade routines. Mobius put that test line for caps in the code as a debug command, I think.*
OWB00001459	I don't believe that was Mobius' reason. His wild speculation concerning post-holocaust economic systems was quite extensive. And of high decibel.
OWB00001460	ENOUGH! SURRENDER THESE SO-CALLED BOTTLECAPS, NUKA AND SUNSET ALIKE. IN THEIR ROLE AS THINGS, THEY WILL SERVE AS ADEQUATE TEST SUBJECTS.
OWB00001461	*What are we going to do? There's no way we can breach the Forbidden Zone. There's those robot scorpions everywhere!*
OWB00001462	-The FORBIDDEN ZONE, where no brain has EVER entered! Nor ever RETURNED.-
OWB00001463	Except Dr. Mobius. And the technologies that could save us, they are out of our reach.
OWB00001464	AND DR. MOBIUS MOCKS US. DID YOU SEE HIS CRACKED MONITOR? HE'S CLEARLY LET HIMSELF GO.
OWB00001465	*What? Ask the Lobotomite for help? 8, I think you need the fluid levels in your logic-assist-pumps checked.*
OWB00001466	If this Lobotomite responded, Dr. Klein, then it is clearly intelligent, perhaps even displays heretofore unknown levels of helpfulness.
OWB00001467	-But what of its brain? We scooped that out! We don't even know where we left it! And for putting it back in... none of us have the knowledge!-
OWB00001468	Yes, but it's still aware and responsive. Look at it... it's regarding us even now, with its big teddy bear eyes.
OWB00001469	If we ask it politely and leave the part about the unnecessary ruthless lobotimizing out, it might be favorably disposed to us.
OWB00001470	I assume full responsibility. I take my duties in the prodding and excision of living, breathing tissue quite seriously.
OWB00001471	*All right, all right. Here. Cap away. Hope that stupid chip chokes on them.*
OWB00001472	*Fine. It's not going to help. That chip will probably refuse them anyway, as stuck up as it is.*
OWB00001473	*Why don't you make the Lobotomite a bottlecap factory, Klein? Or better yet, give it a ton of things to activate the chip?*
OWB00001474	I do not understand, yet I am intrigued by this potential display.
OWB00001475	*No, 8, you don't need to fill up the emitter again, really. Klein means things... for trade. Display for trade.*
OWB00001476	*All right, let's consolidate. There's got to be some junk around here... magazines, useless, more caps, medicinal supplies... useless... here.*
OWB00001477	I found a backup copy of your... pencil processor.
OWB00001478	I found a backup copy of your... pencil processor.
OWB00001479	Excellent! Now I can turn pencils and clipboards into items more useful to society... like lead, spare parts, and duct tape!
OWB00001480	I found a soundwave file for you.
OWB00001481	Right on, daddy-o! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
OWB00001482	Right on, baby! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
OWB00001483	This is the basic stealth test. The robots will be looking for us, but we won't let them find us.
OWB00001484	This should be easy. As long as I don't screw up again.
OWB00001485	This is the advanced test. Watch out for laser tripwires. They'll ruin our day.
OWB00001486	I'm not supposed to give hints, but maybe you can disable the tripwires.
OWB00001487	This is the expert stealth test. If you thought the lasers were bad, wait till you see the proximity mines.
OWB00001488	Psst. If you hack the mines this will go lots faster.
OWB00001489	This is the robot compliance test. If you sneak up on a robot, you can disable it. It's so easy even I can't mess up.
OWB00001490	I don't think I can learn anything else here... but if you want to go again, that's fine.
OWB00001491	Too bad. We hit a tripwire. That one was totally my fault, though. We can start again at the terminal. Sorry...
OWB00001492	Maybe there's a way around the tripwires.
OWB00001493	Too bad. We triggered a mine. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I'll do better next time.
OWB00001494	Maybe we can disable the mines quickly, or find another way past. I'm sure you know best.
OWB00001495	Too bad. We were spotted by robots. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I won't mess up again.
OWB00001496	Stealth Boys are a robot's big weakness.
OWB00001497	I want to recalibrate the Sonic Emitter.
OWB00001498	Right on, daddy. Let's spin some grooves.
OWB00001499	Right on, baby. Let's spin some grooves.
OWB00001500	Have you made any electronic components?
OWB00001501	Yup, here you go.
OWB00001502	Sorry, no more today. Try me again tomorrow.
OWB00001503	I found a backup file for your corroded module.
OWB00001504	Great! Let's fire that up so I can start making electronic components again.
OWB00001505	Mean robot bugs! Mean robot bugs!
OWB00001506	I found that upgrade disk you were looking for.
OWB00001507	Ho-ho, thank God! Finally, something resembling a useful purpose!
OWB00001508	I found you some upgrade disks.
OWB00001509	Well, that'll do just fine.
OWB00001510	Can you tell me more about these pylons?
OWB00001511	ASK BOROUS. I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FENCE THAN ANY BRAIN. EXCEPT MAYBE MOBIUS.
OWB00001512	MOBIUS WAS INVOLVED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION, IF I RECALL. BUT HE'S SUCH A HACK, HE PROBABLY WAS READING OFF OF BOROUS' NOTES AND SCHEMATICS.
OWB00001513	Can you please hurry? I've got a schedule.
OWB00001514	Uh... great. I don't want to hear anymore about that.
OWB00001515	Pylons? What pylons?
OWB00001516	THE RADAR FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE BIG MT CRATER WILL PREVENT - ER, PROTECT YOU FROM STRAYING BEYOND THE FACILITY.
OWB00001517	-The mighty radar fence protects us ALL! Get too close to the blinking posts, and the proximity warning shall be your... WARNING you are too close!-
OWB00001518	*If you get near it, your vision will blur as the electrodes in your head shut off one by one, click click click.*
OWB00001519	Possible memory loss will occur along with long-term nerve degradation. It is tied to not having a brain attached to your nervous system.
OWB00001520	But the nerve degradation is nothing to worry about - such degradation would take many lifespans to become evident. And all biology dies.
OWB00001521	Such tiny inconveniences are less than the greater convenience - and conveyance.
OWB00001522	You see, if rendered unconscious by the pylons, you will be returned to the Sink, seemingly instantaneously by your deadened perceptions.
OWB00001523	Then can you help me get this done as quickly as possible? Sounds like a lot of walking.
OWB00001524	AH, THAT IS CORRECT. YOU MUST WALK UPON YOUR MANY-PENISED FEET. MUCH SLOWER THAN OUR ADVANCED HOVERING ROBOTICAL FRAMES.
OWB00001525	The little teddy bear could always run right into the pylon perimeter on its thick, turgid feet, returning it to us quickly and erectly - directly.
OWB00001526	Doesn't sound like my style. Maybe I'll do a little exploring.
OWB00001527	YOU WOULD NOT DARE. PERHAPS I CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND... USING THE GREATEST OF OUR SCIENCES. THE FENCE.
OWB00001528	Guess I better get walking, then.
OWB00001529	What if I take my time, explore the crater?
OWB00001530	WHAT ILLOGIC IS THIS?! KEEP YOUR FILTHY PENIS-TIPPED FEET OUT OF OUR LABS AND SECRETS!
OWB00001531	-There are things here no Lobotomite was MEANT to see, things that would ASTOUND! And possibly terrify. TERRIFY!-
OWB00001532	*Yeah, we don't come into your lab and decant your solutions.*
OWB00001533	Only the magnificence of our monitors allow for true comprehension of the wonders of Big MT. Shield your jellied eyes lest they burn from your skull.
OWB00001534	Trust me, I want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
OWB00001535	The faster I can get through this, the better.
OWB00001536	OUR INTENTIONS EXACTLY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU RUSH QUICKLY THROUGH THIS TASK SO AS NOT TO WASTE OUR TIME.
OWB00001537	DO NOT GET CURIOUS OR YOU WILL END UP LIKE THE CAT OF SCHRЦDINGER.
OWB00001538	We feared you would be tempted to explore Big MT Crater and examine the many amazing non-mandatory research labs that lie off your designated path.
OWB00001539	The many such optional explorations are discouraged. Work hurriedly, as if you have blinders on, and leave curiosities and items of interest alone.
OWB00001540	-So many sciences and developments! Pass them by! Let impatience and the desire to simply finish, to end it all, quickly and carelessly guide you!-
OWB00001541	*Right you are, 8. In our test results, we'll make a note about how quickly you ran our maz... er, exper... Nobel... challenge.*
OWB00001542	After all, there will be plenty of time afterward to partake of the experiments once our bidding is done.
OWB00001543	Forget this. Where's the exit?
OWB00001544	This whole place sounds dangerous. These devices sound dangerous.
OWB00001545	NONSENSE. THIS PLACE IS NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN A NUCLEAR DETONATION SITE, OUR TECHNOLOGIES NO MORE LETHAL THAN AN OVERCHARGED TESLA CANNON.
OWB00001546	<Cheering>
OWB00001547	...didn't think you'd make it back.
OWB00001548	Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
OWB00001549	Do you know where he went?
OWB00001550	He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
OWB00001551	I have to go after him.
OWB00001552	Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
OWB00001553	That Courier?
OWB00001554	Get her to come to me. Got a message for her, like the message she had for me.
OWB00001555	Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
OWB00001556	The Divide? There's nothing there.
OWB00001557	Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
OWB00001558	And at the Divide, her and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
OWB00001559	...didn't think you'd make it back.
OWB00001560	Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
OWB00001561	Do you know where he went?
OWB00001562	He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
OWB00001563	I have to go after him.
OWB00001564	Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
OWB00001565	That Courier?
OWB00001566	Get him to come to me. Got a message for him, like the message he had for me.
OWB00001567	Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
OWB00001568	The Divide? There's nothing there.
OWB00001569	Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
OWB00001570	And at the Divide, he and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
OWB00001571	...don't want to argue philosophy with you. Brotherhood are preservationists. Tech in the wrong hands, it's dangerous. Mojave's proof.
OWB00001572	No denying that. Proof's here in this crater, all around us. Your tribe, the Brotherhood - haven't met many of you. Wanted to.
OWB00001573	Thought you might be the last chance for the Mojave... the West. The East. But you're all the same mind, obsessed.
OWB00001574	Elijah is obsessed. He's mad. It's why they ordered his execution.
OWB00001575	Two are more alike than you know, too wrapped in the wrong bits of history to see ahead. Not judging. I know how it is.
OWB00001576	People are like couriers, you and him. Sometimes don't even know the message they bring.
OWB00001577	You all had a new flag. Thought maybe new ideas along with it. What you believe isn't any better than the Bear or Bull. No future in either.
OWB00001578	So says the man with the Old World flag on his back. America, the Commonwealth... burned away.
OWB00001579	America sleeps. And until it's dead, I carry it. Just like I carried you. More than hope. Belief.
OWB00001580	There's voices here in the Big Empty, I want to talk to them. Not like your Elijah did. Got questions. Want to hear history give its answer.
OWB00001581	This is Christine Royce. Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel... the Circle.
OWB00001582	Not going to make it through this, hope someone finds this message, gets it to the Brotherhood in the West.
OWB00001583	Tracked a rogue Brotherhood Elder, Elijah, here, to the Big Empty. Place is more than it seems, there's a crater hidden deep inside.
OWB00001584	Junkyard of Pre-War labs scattered across the crater's surface, all still running... like this one.
OWB00001585	Elijah's dissecting these centers, one by one... tracked him to an old Chinese-American internment camp. Survivors, Ghouls, have bomb collars.
OWB00001586	Robots moved in when I tried to intercept him... Elijah sent the camp Ghouls against us both, like walking bombs.
OWB00001587	Got hit by the explosions, woke up here. Guess the medical robots were programmed to bring wounded victims from the camp to this center.
OWB00001588	Some kind of Auto-Doc prototype lab... manned by corpses trapped inside suits that keep them moving, no idea why.
OWB00001589	Not sure how long I'm going to last... cut open my head like a lot of the humans I've seen here, feel strange, can talk, but can't hack the term...
OWB00001590	...wait, an explosion outside. Someone's here... someone's... 
OWB00001591	I was curious about some things.
OWB00001592	Oh, curiosity. I experience that less now that I know everything. Or maybe it was when I found out some unpleasant answers? Mmm-hmm.
OWB00001593	I find things curious as well. Go on.
OWB00001594	Yes, yes, this is getting interesting. You are just filled with these little slices of curiosity, aren't you?
OWB00001595	But I want to leave.
OWB00001596	Now, that seems to be rather hormonal of you. Flight or fight response, you know, hard to cut that out completely.
OWB00001597	Your brain is here, safe with me. We chat over Mentats.
OWB00001598	Why is that a problem?
OWB00001599	I'm not sure except that I'm sure there's a very good raisin for it. I have very good raisins for almost everything I do.
OWB00001600	Even if I forget them occasionally. Although I feel this one is especially important. Ha! Oh well.
OWB00001601	Exactly. I want my brain so I can leave.
OWB00001602	Why did you steal my brain?
OWB00001603	Oh, a variety of raisins... you're something of a homily. Er, anomaly? You're really quiet special, and not in the cranially-challenged way.
OWB00001604	You see, you are the most successful brain extraction experiment ever performed here at Big MT. A victim of your own success, as it were.
OWB00001605	If you were to go back with what your brain knows about the procedure, well...
OWB00001606	...your brain could be popped back in and you could walk right out of here. Can't have brains moving around of their own volition.
OWB00001607	I need my brain back.
OWB00001608	Do you? You seem fine without it.
OWB00001609	And does it even want to go back with you? Maybe you should ask it. It's quite independent, has all manner of opinions.
OWB00001610	Tell you what - I'll leave it up to your brain. If it wants to go, then fine. If not... well, you should respect its wishes.
OWB00001611	You aren't exactly what I was expecting.
OWB00001612	Really. That implies pre-conceived notions - theories and a hypothesis about this meeting? Please extrapolate. What was I... supposed to be like?
OWB00001613	After all, it might be worth a cognitive re-alignment if your theoretical Mobius is better than I.
OWB00001614	Whichever way you want to be killed is fine with me.
OWB00001615	How gracious of you. A mannerly killing.
OWB00001616	I'll trash them like I did your giant piece of junk downstairs.
OWB00001617	Oh now you've done it. I feel a twinge of regret over that little mistake I left on.
OWB00001618	Minions - destroy this intruder! Mmm. Or perhaps make it more dramatic?
OWB00001619	Minions! To me!
OWB00001620	Oh, yes, that's quiet a bit better.
OWB00001621	What minions?
OWB00001622	Whoa, have they not constructed themselves yet? That's a bit premature of me. The Robo-Scorpions, of course.
OWB00001623	They can assemble themselves from floor panels and parts scattered about, quiet inventive - never really know when they might suddenly appear.
OWB00001624	I'll save it, don't want to mix it with alcohol if I can help it.
OWB00001625	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
OWB00001626	I don't know, I'm tripping pretty hard right now.
OWB00001627	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
OWB00001628	I'll save it for later.
OWB00001629	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
OWB00001630	Uh... thanks.
OWB00001631	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
OWB00001632	I have all sorts of amazingly science-arific thoughts and ideas when those chalky tablets are zipping through my biogel.
OWB00001633	I forget them all not long after, though, especially with the data constipating my memory core. Afraid binary streams might shoot out my chassis.
OWB00001634	Had to start using the dome floor and walls here to inscribe equations, although I've somewhat lost track of where they start and end.
OWB00001635	Enough. I'm here to kill you.
OWB00001636	Oh, intriguing. I've never been killed before. Although after that time I got that phlegmy discharge in my biogel... I wished I had been.
OWB00001637	Well, if there's going to be killing, I defer to your expertise in this matter.
OWB00001638	How should we begin? Engineered viruses? Canceratic beams? Atomics? Electrocutioning? Or... should I summon my minions...? Yes, my minions.
OWB00001639	Is that better?
OWB00001640	Depth perception is a problem with this old monitor of mine. Went black a while ago. That's old age for you.
OWB00001641	Should look at getting the visual nerves re-attached... it's just that the right eye would see the wrong things. The flying tortoises were the worst.
OWB00001642	Would you care for a Mentat?
OWB00001643	Wait... sounds like you built the Robo-Scorpions, issued threats to keep the Think Tank occupied.
OWB00001644	Did I? Maybe I did. Can't have them leaving. Some reason for it. Ethics - or con-science?
OWB00001645	You and your Brain are quite alike, I'm sure it knows the raisins better than I do.
OWB00001646	You don't seem aggressive. Why broadcast threats to the Think Tank?
OWB00001647	Oh, I was probably tripping hard on Psycho when I sent that. Had to work myself up to it, not usually violent, except when I am. Then, huh! Watch out!
OWB00001648	So many chems, such varieties! Whenever I take Mentats, I can feel my entire chassis breeeeeathe like a big spherical lung.
OWB00001649	As for the Psycho, sometimes get the chem despositories in my tank all switched up, go in the wrong tube - still, served its purpose.
OWB00001650	Can you tell me about your Robo-Scorpions?
OWB00001651	Well, every scientist needs an army. Mine came to me after these rather large scorpions kept coming in from the dessert. Like poisonous frosting.
OWB00001652	How scary, I thought! But they had survived when nothing else had. Perfect candidates for improvement, as a reward for their tenacity.
OWB00001653	Then I thought, what if they shot energy bolts and acted as walking eyes and data-drained computers and acted as bullhorns? Then I made them bigger.
OWB00001654	Then, I thought about... custard. I do so love custard. Or was it mustard? Mustard custard. Mmmm. I miss sugars and salts.
OWB00001655	I found a holotape to upgrade you. <REMOVE>
OWB00001656	I lost my Sonic Emitter. Can you make me a new one?
OWB00001657	That's a shame, chief! Nobody oughta go through life without music on hand. Just head over to smarty-puck in the main room and he'll sell you one.
OWB00001658	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
OWB00001659	You found my Smart Lights! Installing upgrade.
OWB00001660	Goodbye.
OWB00001661	<Bark.>
OWB00001662	Okay. Heel.
OWB00001663	Go wait somewhere else.
OWB00001664	What are you doing, dog?
OWB00001665	<Pants.>
OWB00001666	I made you. You stick with me. Got it?
OWB00001667	So move.
OWB00001668	Why the hell are you just standing there?
OWB00001669	<Pants.>
OWB00001670	Come with me, girl.
OWB00001671	<Bark.>
OWB00001672	Go wait by the entrance. Good dog.
OWB00001673	<Bark.>
OWB00001674	Hi there, puppy.
OWB00001675	<Pants.>
OWB00001676	Psst. If you want to be sneaky, turn off your Pip-Boy light.
OWB00001677	Pip-Boy light's on.
OWB00001678	We're all lit up. Is it Christmas?
OWB00001679	Nobody ever notices me... but they notice the Pip-Boy light.
OWB00001680	I need my equipment repaired.
OWB00001681	Very good, sir.
OWB00001682	I'd like to talk about something else.
OWB00001683	Lay it on me, daddy-o.
OWB00001684	Lay it on me, mama.
OWB00001685	Can you do anything like that for me?
OWB00001686	Got yourself a sonic emitter, don't ya? Thought so. Bring that old thing on in here, and... bring me some sound samples, and I'll make that baby sing!
OWB00001687	Or scream, if that's what you want.
OWB00001688	You seem pretty laid-back for an engine of destruction.
OWB00001689	Why not? Ain't like I got nothing to prove. Not like that Toaster - now that boy got some issues.
OWB00001690	I'll talk to you later.
OWB00001691	Catch you later, gator.
OWB00001692	Do you play music?
OWB00001693	Mmm... Used to, long time ago. Then Ol' Doc Mo ripped out my music drives and stuck in more acoustical processors.
OWB00001694	Guess you could say I got the blues, even if I can't play them no more.
OWB00001695	What's your purpose here?
OWB00001696	Dig, I'm-a acoustical wizard, kid. Ol' Doc Mo used me to prototype his sonic weapon designs.
OWB00001697	Get me a good sample base to work from and I can whip up a wave that makes Jericho look like a kazoo.
OWB00001698	Why can't you go out there and shut them down?
OWB00001699	OUT THERE? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE. IT'S DANGEROUS. WE'RE SMART, NOT SUICIDAL.
OWB00001700	I'll go get these technological wonders and see how much damage I can do.
OWB00001701	Oh, I'll be sure not to tamper with anything, I promise.
OWB00001702	That sounds suspiciously like I can't leave.
OWB00001703	There's a perimeter?
OWB00001704	So I can't leave?
OWB00001705	If there's nothing more, I need to stop Mobius.
OWB00001706	I could care less about all of this. Can I go?
OWB00001707	This can only work on fields here in the crater?
OWB00001708	YES. BUT NOT CURRENTLY.
OWB00001709	*Yeah, we lost that part of the schematics. Or Borous did. In one of his stupid labs - or inside one of his stupid pets.*
OWB00001710	-It is LOST! All questions lead to this conclusion! The blue fields within Big MT shall be fielded with force... FOREVER.-
OWB00001711	Wait... so this gun you gave me can disable Force Fields?
OWB00001712	YES.
OWB00001713	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
OWB00001714	MAYBE.
OWB00001715	WELL. NO. NOT CURRENTLY.
OWB00001716	What were you saying about force field disruption?
OWB00001717	This thing is pretty cool. It's got a little soundwave thing on the back!
OWB00001718	Uh... thanks.
OWB00001719	*Careful where you're pointing that. That device wasn't always a weapon. It was more like a force field kind of thing... once.*
OWB00001720	-Force fields prevent us from moving! FORward or BACKward!-
OWB00001721	THEY ARE IRRITATING.
OWB00001722	The Sonic Emitter was specially designed to disable our own safety fields here in Big MT. When some of us lost our access passes. Dr. O.
OWB00001723	*That only happened once, and I know you were behind stealth fielding my lab keys, Dala, you formographer!*
OWB00001724	Dr. O, you rewind that comment!
OWB00001725	*Plenty of rewinding already going on in your formography tapes... surprised the things don't snap out of their cases with repeated 'observations.'*
OWB00001726	For the love of... Please. Stop. Fighting.
OWB00001727	If there's a weapon you can give me, hand it over, I'll put it to good use.
OWB00001728	If you have the gun already, I don't understand what you need.
OWB00001729	IT IS TRULY THE END OF ALL INTELLIGENCE WHEN THE LOBOTOMITE SPEAKS MORE WISDOM THAN YOU "GENIUSES."
OWB00001730	SO - IF WE HAVE THE SOUNDWAVE... SONIC... PROJECT-O THING GUN... THEN WHAT IN HEISENBERG'S NAME DO WE NEED FROM X-8?! ANYONE?!
OWB00001731	I believe we need a new frequency embedded into the gun. It was designed to broadcast many sounds once charged. We just don't know the frequency.
OWB00001732	-And it is LOST in X-8! Just as X-8 is forever lost to us! The sadness of my high-school days! The sadness of my YOUTH, MY youth! LOST!-
OWB00001733	*O really, Borous? All you did in High School was Commie fink-tattle-tale on all the kids you hated, you little teacher's pet brown-hound.*
OWB00001734	GIVE. THE. LOBOTOMITE. THE. EMITTER. DOES IT HAVE AN AUDIO EFFECT FREQUENCY LOADED?
OWB00001735	*O... I don't think so. Wait...*
OWB00001736	WHAT IS HE DOING?
OWB00001737	*I think he's sonjaculating into the gun. Getting it... warmed up.*
OWB00001738	*Ding... turkey's done.*
OWB00001739	YOU GIVE IT TO THE LOBOTOMITE. I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT THING.
OWB00001740	*O, I don't think so.*
OWB00001741	I'll do it if you two are going to be ashamed of your own technological needs. Let me give it a little sonic sterilization first...
OWB00001742	wooOOOoooOOO... all right, all anti-bacterial fresh.
OWB00001743	Here, my little Teddy Bear. I have thoroughly removed all RobCo termlink code spew from the device. It is clean, shiny, and ready for your hands.
OWB00001744	*O... Doctor Klein... Doctor Klein? If I may intersect for a moment.*
OWB00001745	WHAT IS IT? THE LOBOTOMITE IS ASKING ME THINGS, O, AND I AM TRYING TO IGNORE THEM. MY PROCESSORS CAN'T IGNORE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
OWB00001746	*Well... you know how we asked it to fetch the Sonic Emitter thing? Turns out we already have it. What are the odds?*
OWB00001747	WHAT IS THIS, A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR?! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK LIKE A COLLECTION OF ROUND-EARTHERS!
OWB00001748	*You're always yelling! My receptors can't take it anymore - and neither can my feelings!*
OWB00001749	I AM YELLING BECAUSE YOU CONTAMINATED SPECIMENS CAN'T KEEP YOUR PROBES OFF THE VOLUME KNOB ON MY VOICE MODULE!
OWB00001750	Can you turn those lights on for me?
OWB00001751	As much as I'd love to, I'm afraid not. The data from that study has gone missing. You'll have to find a backup if you want to use the Smart Lights.
OWB00001752	I certainly can!
OWB00001753	Unlike certain other lightswitches, I'm competent. I'd just love to turn those lights on for you.
OWB00001754	I had some more questions.
OWB00001755	I'm happy to answer what I can.
OWB00001756	Is that anything like what the other light switch is working on?
OWB00001757	Hmph! I suppose if you want to conflate the betterment of man's mind with... with a luminous aphrodisiac.
OWB00001758	Our project was by far the more significant. And the more... intense.
OWB00001759	What were the results?
OWB00001760	We observed a fascinating phenomenon: certain spectra of visible light actually increased cognitive function and reasoning ability.
OWB00001761	Of course, Doctor Mobius' brain is so big already, we had a hard time measuring it.
OWB00001762	That sounds like what the other light switch was working on.
OWB00001763	Eww! Don't lump me in with her! I'm way more fun!
OWB00001764	I have to go. We'll talk later.
OWB00001765	Certainly. I'm looking forward to it.
OWB00001766	What function do you serve?
OWB00001767	Doctor Mobius and I were deeply involved in research on the ability of light levels to enhance human cognition.
OWB00001768	What can I say, she and I just... click.
OWB00001769	You really know how to break a synthetic girl's heart!
OWB00001770	Calm down, I don't have a thing for the light switch.
OWB00001771	Okay... I believe you. This time.
OWB00001772	Okay then. Forget I said anything.
OWB00001773	I don't know, smart lights could be useful.
OWB00001774	I knew it! You've got a thing for her, don't you? Oh, you just make me sick!
OWB00001775	Sounds like there's some bad blood between you. Or, um, circuits.
OWB00001776	That bitch. She thinks she's so much better than everybody just because her processors are bigger. Ooh, she makes me so mad!
OWB00001777	I had other questions.
OWB00001778	Sure thing, sweetie!
OWB00001779	Can you turn those lights on for me?
OWB00001780	Oh... I'd love to, sweetie, but I don't have the programming. All the data from the experiments was lost.
OWB00001781	You'd have to go out into that nasty old crater and find the backup copy.
OWB00001782	You bet I can!
OWB00001783	You bet I can! I bet that's more than that other tramp can do, huh?
OWB00001784	And what did you find out?
OWB00001785	Oh, it was super exciting! It turns out that some pretty colored lights can make you way better at talking to people!
OWB00001786	I have to go now.
OWB00001787	Bye now!
OWB00001788	I saw another light switch in the other room. Do you control that one too?
OWB00001789	Oh... her. Trust me sweetie, you're better off not thinking about that frigid little ice queen.
OWB00001790	What are you, some kind of novelty talking light switch?
OWB00001791	I was Doctor Mobius'... personal assistant! We were studying... um... oh, shoot, what was it?
OWB00001792	Oh yeah! Lightning! No, no, wait, uh... Lighting. That's right. How lighting affects human interaction.
OWB00001793	I'll handle the brains. You stay here - you'll be more useful outside my head.
OWB00001794	That arrangement suits me fine. Do try not to get too many holes drilled in your head, will you? I may want to drop by for sentimental reasons.
OWB00001795	If the Think Tank won't hold up their bargain, we'll make them. Let's go.
OWB00001796	Very well, I suppose I have no choice. Goodbye peaceful, soothing brain jar, hello head wounds and scorpions.
OWB00001797	Right! Look out, Think Tank! This brain is coming out of its jar!
OWB00001798	Hmm. Let me think about this.
OWB00001799	Ha! Thinking without a brain. The very idea is perverse.
OWB00001800	Then let's go make them share. Come on, brain, it's stomping time!
OWB00001801	Oh, lovely, we've reached the mindless violence portion of the program. Tell me, what exactly are you - and I use the word loosely - planning?
OWB00001802	Why? They promised to put us back together once I did what they wanted.
OWB00001803	And you believed them? Really? I know you were recently deprived of my fabulous advice, but... really?
OWB00001804	Once I'm delivered into their clutches, they'll find a way past the radar fence and the whole Mojave will be their playground.
OWB00001805	And that is assuming of course that one of them doesn't take a fancy to our body and decide to slip his own brain into it instead.
OWB00001806	Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.
OWB00001807	Heh. Hold that thought. That's almost clever.
OWB00001808	I'm not spending the rest of my life here when there's a whole world to loot.
OWB00001809	Ah yes, there's that greed and general sense of malice. I'd nearly forgotten it. What's the plan, then?
OWB00001810	Come on, we have a duty to the Wasteland, we have to get out of here!
OWB00001811	There go those glands again. Is the endorphin rush you get from doing the right thing really that good?
OWB00001812	What's it going to take to convince you?
OWB00001813	I'd like to find a nice little place to live, maybe in Goodsprings, and settle down where we won't get shot at. Not as often, at any rate.
OWB00001814	But since that doesn't seem likely... what's your plan?
OWB00001815	I don't recall giving you a choice. Let's go.
OWB00001816	While the brute force approach is a lovely one, really, it won't work.
OWB00001817	Even if I wanted to settle myself back in your skull and go to all the trouble of reconnecting nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
OWB00001818	We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
OWB00001819	Never mind. I want to talk about something else.
OWB00001820	Of course you do. How... scintillating.
OWB00001821	Maybe not, but it got your attention, didn't it?
OWB00001822	I suppose it did. Bravo, you've managed to intimidate a brain in a jar.
OWB00001823	I would. And I'd follow it up with an alcohol-and-ant-nectar cocktail every night.
OWB00001824	You're a monster! A deranged, self-destructive monster!
OWB00001825	Don't tempt me, brain.
OWB00001826	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Sir.
OWB00001827	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Ma'am.
OWB00001828	Fine, never mind.
OWB00001829	Yes, I rather thought so.
OWB00001830	Once you're back in my head, I'll watch television. Lots. And lots. Of television.
OWB00001831	You... you wouldn't! That's inhuman!
OWB00001832	I could smash this tank you're in. How about that?
OWB00001833	By all means, if the idea of spending the rest of your days as a true Lobotomite appeals to you.
OWB00001834	Actually, come to think of it, you probably wouldn't mind that, would you?
OWB00001835	We'll revisit this topic later.
OWB00001836	Oh yes, I rather expect we will. We'll be having a very long talk about crawling through old ruins, haring off on missions of revenge. And Cazadores.
OWB00001837	Oh yes, we'll talk a lot about them.
OWB00001838	I didn't realize it caused you so much distress.
OWB00001839	Well, maybe next time you hear me telling you that charging a Nightkin with a penknife is a bad idea, you'll listen.
OWB00001840	Oh come on, that stuff's fun!
OWB00001841	Fun? Fun?! Is tetanus fun? Hmm? Is rickets? What about sepsis, enjoy that do we?
OWB00001842	The things you do with our body are suicidally dangerous, and if you could silence your glandular impulses, you would hear me screaming at you!
OWB00001843	Of course you're responsible! You're my brain!
OWB00001844	I most certainly am not! I am the seat of all reason and logic in our little partnership!
OWB00001845	All those... feelings that motivate you, that sense of righteousness and that rush you get when you help someone, do you know where those come from?
OWB00001846	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, those urges to hurt people, to take and crush and maim, do you know where they come from?
OWB00001847	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, do you know where those come from?
OWB00001848	Glands. They come from glands. Free of the tyranny of your ape-like and primitive endocrine system, I can see how foolish your motives are.
OWB00001849	This is too weird. I'll be back later.
OWB00001850	Barring the unlikely event that I evolve some sort of rocket-propelled locomotion, I will be here.
OWB00001851	Cool! I can talk to my own brain! Can my heart and spine talk, too?
OWB00001852	Err... yes, well, you do know that those particular organs don't have neurons and are thus incapable of speech, yes?
OWB00001853	How the hell did Mobius get hold of my brain?
OWB00001854	After the Think Tank extracted me from your skull, they fell to bickering amongst themselves. I'm sad to say we were quite forgotten about.
OWB00001855	Dr. Mobius saw an opportunity to gain some leverage, and had me spirited away to his dome.
OWB00001856	Why does my brain sound so... masculine?
OWB00001857	Ah, well, as to that... you'd be surprised how hard a feminine-sounding voice modulator is to find in the Forbidden Zone.
OWB00001858	It's not as though brain-sustaining life support tanks grow on trees. I had to take what I could get.
OWB00001859	Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here.
OWB00001860	Ew! Crawl back in there? Are you mad? I don't know where you've been!
OWB00001861	For all I know, you're riddled with disease, or packing one of those delightful head wounds you seem to attract!
OWB00001862	I'm not crawling back into your head just to ooze right back out again!
OWB00001863	Well... I suppose you've convinced me well enough. I'll rejoin your body if that's your final decision.
OWB00001864	Unfortunately, before we get to that stage of the proceedings, we have a problem.
OWB00001865	Even if I could settle myself back in your skull and reconnect all those pesky nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
OWB00001866	We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
OWB00001867	So... what do you say, brain? Join me for some more wild adventures?
OWB00001868	Actually, yes. I would love a cookie.
OWB00001869	I... ugh... is this really what I have to look forward to?
OWB00001870	Listen, you're my brain, so you'd better be more respectful!
OWB00001871	Oh, had I? What exactly will you do if I don't? Not put me back in that cranial donjon you call your head? Heavens forbid!
OWB00001872	Why are you such a dick?
OWB00001873	Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do! Me! A, quote, dick, unquote. As if I'm the one responsible for the way you carry on, gadding about the Wastes.
OWB00001874	I'm not the one that makes us clamber around tetanus-infested ancient Vaults or go charging off to New Vegas on missions of ill-conceived revenge!
OWB00001875	And have we forgotten who got us shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave? Hmm? Do you think I enjoyed that little moment?
OWB00001876	Are you... my brain?
OWB00001877	Ah, lovely, figured that out, have we? Would you like a cookie?
OWB00001878	-Gabe, down! Down, boy! Stop it!-
OWB00001879	-Now... let the intruder have the Sonic Emitter schematics. Klein wants it, all right, boy? Let the intruder dig it up wherever you buried it.-
OWB00001880	-Gaaabe! I am sorry I put your brain in a bowl, boy. Oohhh, who's a good boy. YOU are!-
OWB00001881	-Gabe would bark and snarl and bite whenever ANYONE came to visit.-
OWB00001882	-That's why I replaced his legs with spare parts and fed him a steady diet of Psycho-laced dog chow.-
OWB00001883	-Ohhhhh yes, my PET, Gabe. I'd forgotten about the old boy and the COUNTLESS experiments I'd done on him back at Higgs.-
OWB00001884	-Gaaabe? Gabe, you're about to have your FAVORITE treat - a VISITOR. Won't that be nice? DON'T eat the visitor, boy. Don't. Please.-
OWB00001885	-The Residential Test. Wasn't that shut down for some reason?-
OWB00001886	-Oh my, you got to the Residential Test! This is really Borous, by the way, hello again. None of us thought you would get this far.
OWB00001887	-Attention students. This is the pre-recorded voice of your pre-recorded principal. Doctor Principal BOROUS!-
OWB00001888	-You may know me as the Head Chief First Researcher of Labs Z-9 and Z-14.-
OWB00001889	-There I fought valiantly to preserve rattlesnake DNA, and put it right where it belongs, in the husk of another feared predator.-
OWB00001890	-Oh, and the tarantula hawk. Can't splice enough, I always say, especially if you can make a magnificent Cazador!-
OWB00001891	-Enough about ME. It has come to my attention that many of you SEEMINGLY innocent children have been subverted by Red Propaganda.-
OWB00001892	-This is a MOST serious matter requiring the MOST serious of detentions.-
OWB00001893	-Can you spell detention? I'll tell you how I spell it: DEATHtention. Commie-pinko-traitors, ALL.-
OWB00001894	-Now, I will send vicious cybernetic cyborg dogs through the corridors to weed all you traitors out.-
OWB00001895	-They will sniff out which among you have chosen the commie path.-
OWB00001896	-Especially YOU, Betsy Bright, who turned me down for the high school dance so you could smoke with RICHIE MARCUS.-
OWB00001897	-Hall Monitors will also be vigilant. Step outside during class, and they'll make sure you make a speedy jump back to your desk.-
OWB00001898	-Hold your urine and wait for the PROPER bathroom breaktime.-
OWB00001899	-School is a sacred trust. Even though I am a long-ago graduate of this hated facility...-
OWB00001900	-...now I see its worth, and see it was corrupted by fraternities, and... GIRLS. Yuck!-
OWB00001901	-Today the cafeteria will be serving... nothing, because I didn't build one.-
OWB00001902	-No cafeteria. No bathrooms. No swirlies. No chocolate pudding left in the chairs of brilliant minds. What are you going to do now RICHIE MARCUS?-
OWB00001903	-Please place all filthy propaganda books in the incinerator chute in the Sink, especially those with funny pictures of me in them.-
OWB00001904	-I am lord of this institution. Where once, long ago, I was a student here. Now, I am its OMNIPOTENT GOD-PRINCIPAL.-
OWB00001905	-As I soon will be LORD of Big MT. DOO DE DOO. Do you hear that? It is my trumpet of victoryness!-
OWB00001906	-Down at the end of the hall is BALL storage. For jocks who like BALLS, like RICHIE MARCUS. Do you hear me, Betsy? RICHIE likes BALLS.-
OWB00001907	-You are in the LIBRARY. Be quiet here and filled with SHHHHH.-
OWB00001908	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
OWB00001909	Ooh, you found my mood lighting! Installing upgrade!
OWB00001910	How did he manage that?
OWB00001911	I don't know. I'm afraid the trauma of our separation rendered me quite insensate. I didn't come around until I was safely ensconced in this tank.
OWB00001912	I'm quite sure whatever he did was highly scientific, though.
OWB00001913	That seems like a pretty unlikely coincidence.
OWB00001914	Hardly. Dr. Mobius keeps a close optical sensor on the goings-on at the Think Tank. As soon as he saw the opportunity, he took it.
OWB00001915	Well, that answers that. On to something else.
OWB00001916	Well, as long as your curiosity is satisfied.
OWB00001917	You talk a lot of science, brain, but you don't make a lot of sense.
OWB00001918	Very well, let me put this in terms you'll understand. Brain: smart. Heart: stupid. Spine: very stupid. You: exceptionally stupid.
OWB00001919	Does that explain the matter?
OWB00001920	Well, you don't have a mouth, but you can talk. Explain that, smarty-pants!
OWB00001921	I don't have... Ugh! I have an inferior frontal gyrus wired directly into a speech-synthesizing processor.
OWB00001922	Your heart can't be wired up to a... a thought-synthesizing processor! You can't talk to it!
OWB00001923	Uh, brain? You seem... awful smart all of a sudden.
OWB00001924	I've been bettering myself, I'll have you know. I've been reading - actual literature, mind you, not that ЎLa Fantoma! or Tжles of Chivalrie drivel.
OWB00001925	I've been studying the classics, acquiring a solid grounding in medicine and the sciences.
OWB00001926	Also, I'm fairly certain this tank has been liberally salted with ground Mentats.
OWB00001927	All this smart-talk is hurting my head. Please stop it.
OWB00001928	Well, we certainly wouldn't want to strain your comprehension, would we?
OWB00001929	What about my spine?
OWB00001930	Argh!
OWB00001931	[SUCCEEDED] I... well... look, it's all a very complex system of biofeedback and other things I wouldn't expect you to understand.
OWB00001932	But you're the source of most of those glands. Unless you're arguing that my thyroid is to blame.
OWB00001933	[FAILED] And you're an expert on your own glandular delusions, are you? No, leave this one to an impartial authority: me.
OWB00001934	That doesn't seem quite right...
OWB00001935	Admit it. You're just as glandular as I am.
OWB00001936	Oh, all right... perhaps I am, but at least I'm logical about it.
OWB00001937	What's so bad about letting the brains get out? They don't seem that terrible.
OWB00001938	Don't seem so bad? They vivisected us just to see what would happen! Have you forgotten the Lobotomites? The Cyberdogs, I assume you saw those?
OWB00001939	Imagine that kind of "science" spread across the entire Mojave. Every man, woman and child we've met reduced to a Lobotomite.
OWB00001940	Is that what you want?
OWB00001941	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I do miss those endorphin rushes when we save the day. All right - what's the plan?
OWB00001942	You're part of me. I know you don't want to let that happen any more than I do.
OWB00001943	[FAILED] We have to do no such thing! Just don't bring them the tools they need to get out!
OWB00001944	Come on! We have to stop them! And stuff!
OWB00001945	That's going to be a problem. Until they fix me, I can't leave Big Mountain either.
OWB00001946	Hmm, I had overlooked that particular angle. Still, it's not so bad staying here, is it? We could be comfortable.
OWB00001947	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
OWB00001948	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
OWB00001949	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
OWB00001950	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
OWB00001951	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
OWB00001952	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
OWB00001953	<Lie> I promise I'll take better care of myself.
OWB00001954	Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
OWB00001955	I promise I'll take better care of myself.
OWB00001956	Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
OWB00001957	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
OWB00001958	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
OWB00001959	Please tell me we weren't that perverse when I was in your head.
OWB00001960	Anyways, even if... that... was on the table, we have a problem.
OWB00001961	Too bad. I've got arms, you don't. You're coming with me.
OWB00001962	I can see there's going to be no reasoning with you at all, is there? I'm nothing more than a slave to your deranged, glandular whims.
OWB00001963	I can see your point. What can I do to make this a fair compromise?
OWB00001964	If you want me back, we need to establish some ground rules.
OWB00001965	First, showers! Second, regular check-ups. Regular, mind you, and from a reputable doctor.
OWB00001966	That Julie Farkas woman, for example. She seems to know a thing or two.
OWB00001967	Third, you need to listen to me more than your hormonal choir and genitalian orchestra. Promise me that, and you've got a deal.
OWB00001968	But what about the good things? What about crushing those who oppose you, the smell of fire... loot?
OWB00001969	All motivated by nothing but an imbalance in certain brain chemicals. The tank corrects for that - I feel no urge toward antisocial behavior.
OWB00001970	But what about the good things? What about a cool breeze on your cheek, the smell of food... love?
OWB00001971	Overrated biological feedback. Believe me, you only feel that way because you've got all that meat... oozing hormones.
OWB00001972	Don't you want to be reunited? I thought you'd be happy to get back into my head!
OWB00001973	I'm not going to lie to you, the prospect is definitely not that appealing.
OWB00001974	Look at it from my perspective. Here, I have peace, quiet, and safety - well, barring the odd rogue scorpion.
OWB00001975	In your head, I've got poison, radiation, grisly injuries, and biological functions.
OWB00001976	Do you know how much more you can get done when you're not constantly looking for places to urinate? It's quite a lot, I can tell you.
OWB00001977	What about you? That tank isn't exactly looking springtime fresh.
OWB00001978	I... well... that's a completely different matter! The tank isn't biological, it's not the same at all!
OWB00001979	I've been busy.
OWB00001980	Oh yes, I rather expect you have. You must have been swamped, you poor dear. Why don't you relax and put your feet up?
OWB00001981	I've just been traumatically scooped out of my body and plugged into this jar, that's all. But, you've been busy.
OWB00001982	Yes. Because running around a crater full of bizarre science experiments, hygiene is a top priority.
OWB00001983	Well, I see sarcasm hasn't eluded you. Fine, perhaps now isn't the best time, but it's the principle of the thing.
OWB00001984	There's no need to be sarcastic. Meeting your own brain is a slightly odd event.
OWB00001985	Yes, well, believe me, the opposite is equally true. Good Lord, have you bathed at all since they pulled me out of you?
OWB00001986	Let's just say violence is the last resort of the civilized man, and I'm feeling mighty uncivilized.
OWB00001987	With an attitude like that, it's small wonder you got yourself shot in the head.
OWB00001988	[SUCCEEDED] Not much of one for the high-tech approach, are we? Well, I suppose we'd best get on with it.
OWB00001989	I'm going to show them even a video screen can get a black eye.
OWB00001990	[FAILED] Hmm... yes, I don't think you've quite thought this through yet.
OWB00001991	I sort of thought I'd just start punching things and see where that gets me.
OWB00001992	[SUCCEEDED] Going the old-fashioned route, are we? I rather like it. What's next?
OWB00001993	The brains have forgotten the little things. Things like sharp blades and heavy chunks of steel.
OWB00001994	[FAILED] Before you go that route, do me a favor and read up on the history of battles in which men with swords fought giant brains with lasers.
OWB00001995	I thought since they like lasers so much, I'd surprise them. With a club or something.
OWB00001996	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you have always been thorough in your destruction. All right, what's your plan?
OWB00001997	Ever had a squirrel brain omelet? That, but on a bigger scale. And with bombs.
OWB00001998	[FAILED] I see. And you plan to be standing in the midst of this mayhem? Well, that's a novel strategy.
OWB00001999	I think bombs? Yeah, maybe bombs.
OWB00002000	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, energy weapons. Yes... I'd almost forgotten how much fun those are. How do we proceed, then?
OWB00002001	I'm going to show them what's really the brightest thing in the room.
OWB00002002	[FAILED] I hate to say it, but your ability to handle high-tech energy weapons doesn't exactly instill within me great confidence.
OWB00002003	We've got lasers, right? I thought we'd use lasers.
OWB00002004	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... now that you mention it, I do miss that lovely "rat-a-tat boom" a bit. It's just not the same without a body to feel the recoil.
OWB00002005	What's the next step, then?
OWB00002006	I'm going to give them a demonstration of the physics behind small, fast-moving chunks of lead.
OWB00002007	[FAILED] Yes, I think you haven't quite got the hang of punning yet.
OWB00002008	I'm going to introduce them to a world of pain. Bullet pain.
OWB00002009	Are you really saying you'd let the Think Tank outwit us?
OWB00002010	You're trying to appeal to my ego now, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something about ego, my friend.
OWB00002011	Ego does not come from a gland. That's all intellect, and I'll be damned if I'm going to float here and let them put one over on us! What's the plan?
OWB00002012	Noooooooooo...
OWB00002013	What is this strange new world around me? What does it hold in store for a dreamer such as myself?
OWB00002014	What... I feel like this has happened before. Yet I feel awake for the first time? What is going on?
OWB00002015	Who... am I? I... feel different, awake, alive for the first time ever.
OWB00002016	Big MT: I, Dr. Mobius, will soon control you - and all of Science!
OWB00002017	Mighty Think Tank... still c-c-c-c-cowering in your Dome? Cower, you fools. Cower.
OWB00002018	Time to reward myself with a little breath-freshening Mentat. Mmmm.
OWB00002019	Try to leave your Dome, Think Tank, and you will be punished by the pincered might of my Robo-Scorpion army!
OWB00002020	Think Tank... I wouldn't even use binary to describe my exponential hatred for you.
OWB00002021	My aggression is increasing geometrically. Do you hear me, "Think" Tank?!
OWB00002022	Soon... all Science will be mine.
OWB00002023	Oh, Klein - did I mention that my zone is FORBIDDEN to you? Ha ha ha ha ha! SO forbidden.
OWB00002024	2 plus 2 equals... 4-Bidden, idiots of the Think Tank!
OWB00002025	I hope I didn't leave my Giant Robo-Scorpion on. That thing eats power like no tomorrow.
OWB00002026	I'll just set this on repeat while I go relieve my tank... no one will know.
OWB00002027	Rant! Rant! Rant! See how I abstract my rage, Think Tank? I hold you in such disdain I generalize my hatred for you!
OWB00002028	Go, my mighty Robo-Scorpions. Crawl in search of intelligence. Then, sting said intelligence, yes, sting it.
OWB00002029	My Robo-Scorpions will soon conquer the Crater. It's just that this is a big place, so it's hard to conquer everything.
OWB00002030	Klein... remember the time you forgot to carry the 2 and nearly blew up the Y-0 Research Center? Oh, wait, you did! Or was that me?
OWB00002031	Klein, as useless as the bottle of the same name... well, except as an example of an object that uselessly tries to fulfill its purpose.
OWB00002032	-The Cazador Preserve and the Nightstalker Splicing facilities are strangely quiet. TOO quiet.-
OWB00002033	-X-8 and X-13 and X-2 are your DESTINATION, non-Lobotomite. Can you HEAR us?! You MUST hurry!-
OWB00002034	-What TERRORS does Big MT hold for the intrepid seeker?! Really. Does anyone know? I'm at a loss.-
OWB00002035	-BEWARE Dr. Mobius' army! His Robo-Scorpions crawl everywhere, in SEARCH of intelligence to devour and stupify!-
OWB00002036	-Anyone who can understand these messages - YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE! We will FIND you!-
OWB00002037	Slight chance of seed dispersal from Botanical Gardens predicted in the late evening.
OWB00002038	There is no standing on the green pipes. If you are standing on the green pipes, please get off them at once.
OWB00002039	If you see Robo-Scorpions, do not attempt to fight them. They will shoot you with their robotic stingers, and then... possibly explode.
OWB00002040	Do not attempt to breach the Big MT force fields. Doing so could allow dangerous ideas and/or creatures having those ideas to escape.
OWB00002041	Are you out there, my little teddy bear Lobotomite? Dala misses you and the pitter-patter of your penis feet so much.
OWB00002042	DR. MOBIUS, SURRENDER YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT WIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ODDS ARE HEAVILY IN YOUR FAVOR.
OWB00002043	ATTENTION: THE BLUE GRASS SURROUNDING THE DOME ABSORBS ALL FERTILIZER, INCLUDING FECAL MATTER. THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU LICENSE TO EXCRETE ON IT.
OWB00002044	X-12 IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ON AN UNRELATED NOTE, WHOEVER CLOSED X-12, PLEASE REPORT TO THE DOME.
OWB00002045	PLEASE AVOID BOOM TOWN FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WEAPON TESTING IS RESOLVED.
OWB00002046	ATTENTION: BIG MT. THIS IS AN URGENT MESSAGE. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE A GECKO... ECKO. ECHO? ECH-O. ECHOOOO. ECHOOOO.
OWB00002047	THE REST OF YOU SHOULD TRY THIS INTERCOM THING. IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF... SKY-GOD!
OWB00002048	ALL LOBOTOMITES, PLEASE STOP MILLING ABOUT. REALLY.
OWB00002049	*Attention: Big MT. There is a 95% chance of clear skies interrupted with artillery fire.*
OWB00002050	*Attention: Lobotomites. Do not neglect to wash the Walking Eye!*
OWB00002051	*The Uncanny Valley research center has been canceled until further notice. As in, until someone notices it.*
OWB00002052	*We are reading increased levels of berserkity in Securitrons from the De-Construction Plant.*
OWB00002053	*Force fields can only be disrupted by a specific frequency. If anyone has found the frequency, last seen around X-8, let the Dome know at once.*
OWB00002054	*Do not approach the pylons. Pylons are the glowing things. Also, do not approach a fallen pylon. If you see a fallen pylon, call security.*
OWB00002055	WELL DONE, LOBOTOMITE. SOON, THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SAFE.
OWB00002056	THE LOBOTOMITE HAS RETRIEVED TWO... COUNT THEM, TWO... OF THE THREE TECHNOLOGIES.
OWB00002057	OUR LOBOTOMITE: THREE. DR. MOBIUS: ZERO.
OWB00002058	Intruder, return what you have stolen from X-2!
OWB00002059	If you think braving the Cyberdogs of X-8 makes you... brave, intruder, it is no use. All Cyberdogs are under my command, and they will bite you.
OWB00002060	You think that Aural Stealth Suit will keep you hidden from me? Think again!
OWB00002061	Intruder, you will not escape the eyes of my Robo-Scorpions! Or their pincers!
OWB00002062	On second thought, never mind.
OWB00002063	Well, the important thing is that you're good and decisive about these things.
OWB00002064	Certainly. Whenever you're ready.
OWB00002065	I think I need to think about it some more.
OWB00002066	I'm sure. In you go.
OWB00002067	Fine. I hope you'll pay a bit more attention to me this time around.
OWB00002068	All right. This shouldn't be too painful...
OWB00002069	I've changed my mind. I want you back in my skull after all.
OWB00002070	Oh, what joy. What bliss. Well, seeing as how I have no leverage with which to persuade you otherwise... are you sure?
OWB00002071	I've come to a similar conclusion myself. Are you sure that's what you want?
OWB00002072	I've thought it over, and I want you back in my head. We're both stronger together.
OWB00002073	Well... so long, then. I'm going back to the Think Tank. They promised to let me out.
OWB00002074	This is ridiculous. I can't leave my brain here to rot.
OWB00002075	Great!
OWB00002076	I know it's great!
OWB00002077	I will!
OWB00002078	Fine!
OWB00002079	Okay, then. I'm going.
OWB00002080	Good, go!
OWB00002081	Maybe I'll explore the Big Mountain more before I go back to the Think Tank.
OWB00002082	Will you take some free advice from your brain? Don't trust the Think Tank. They aren't... right. In the brain, I mean.
OWB00002083	They're fiercely protective of their technology, and none of them is likely to share it willingly.
OWB00002084	I suppose I'll go back to the Think Tank and get them to let me out. They promised to do that much.
OWB00002085	Fine, you can stay here. Not like I need this hassle.
OWB00002086	Oh, no, you don't need this hassle. You're too busy treating your body like a canvas of sucking flesh wounds to deal with your brain!
OWB00002087	Ugh... It's not that I didn't like being in your head, you understand. As far as heads go, it was a rather nice one.
OWB00002088	Well, then. I suppose this is goodbye for now. What will you do?
OWB00002089	Maybe I have been a little unfair. If you want to stay here, I'll let you.
OWB00002090	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I accounted for that! Do you think I'm so stupid... no, you're right.
OWB00002091	Maintaining my current functionality will be harder than I thought. This bears some further looking into.
OWB00002092	Then surely you've taken into account the corrosive effects of long-term exposure to biogel.
OWB00002093	[FAILED] Actually, yes. I do think that. I think that exact thing. All the time.
OWB00002094	You really think you're smarter than the Think Tank and Dr. Mobius combined?
OWB00002095	And if I put you back?
OWB00002096	I'm not entirely sure. I suppose there's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
OWB00002097	What form that might take, though, I cannot say.
OWB00002098	Why did you never say anything about how you felt before?
OWB00002099	What did you think all those self-preservation instincts were, hmm?
OWB00002100	All those times you thought, for a fleeting second, "maybe I shouldn't punch that Deathclaw in the face?"
OWB00002101	That was me, telling you exactly how I felt before!
OWB00002102	What would happen to me if I left you here?
OWB00002103	Hmm. Let me see... I suppose you'd continue on much as you are now, using that synthetic thinking machine to do the heavy lifting.
OWB00002104	Unless of course the batteries run out, but that seems unlikely.
OWB00002105	Look what happened to the Think Tank. Do you want to end up like them after a few hundred years?
OWB00002106	It's true, the brains here have experienced some degree of... deterioration. I'm confident that with a few decades of work, I can solve the problem.
OWB00002107	Well, if you like being stuck in there so much, maybe I'll just leave you.
OWB00002108	Oh no! Please don't leave me here in this nice, safe dome where I have access to nutritive fluids and a fully indexed library!
OWB00002109	Please don't deprive me of being dragged through a landscape so bleak, it was actually improved by the end of the world!
OWB00002110	I don't know how I could bear it.
OWB00002111	So, what, you'd rather just stay here? Never leaving that tank of... whatever that stuff is?
OWB00002112	Well, certainly there might be some things I miss about being ambulatory. We have seen some incredible sights, haven't we?
OWB00002113	Jason Bright and his followers launching into the vast unknown.
OWB00002114	HELIOS One coming back on-line.
OWB00002115	But still, given the tremendous, potentially life-ending peril that went along with those... yes. Yes, I'd rather stay here.
OWB00002116	I don't know. I have to think about this some more.
OWB00002117	Yes of course, by all means take your time.
OWB00002118	Well... maybe we could keep going like this. What do you think?
OWB00002119	You mean, I'll stay in my tank and you'll stay in your... skin... and we'll each handle our own areas of expertise?
OWB00002120	Hmm, I certainly like the sound of that.
OWB00002121	I think we have to trust each other and acknowledge that we aren't complete if we're separated.
OWB00002122	I suppose there might be some advantage to that, yes. There's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
OWB00002123	Yeah, bet you didn't think of that, huh?
OWB00002124	Yes yes, all right, bravo, you've come up with something I neglected to consider. There'll be no living with you now. So, what do we do about this?
OWB00002125	So, we're at an impasse. You can't feel what I feel, and I can't think the way you think.
OWB00002126	Indeed. Quite the conundrum. How do you suppose we resolve it?
OWB00002127	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... I suppose you're right. That does call certain assumptions into question, doesn't it?
OWB00002128	Isn't it just as true that you only feel this way because you're lacking those hormones?
OWB00002129	[FAILED] I don't "believe" it, it's just a simple fact. One may as well "believe" the earth is round or that the specific gravity of uranium is 18.9.
OWB00002130	You can't really believe that.
OWB00002131	<Humming>
OWB00002132	Let's see... 4... 5... 8... 1... 5... 1... yes! That's it! I've calculated pi to the very end!
OWB00002133	It's not that I want to be a Robobrain exactly, but... some treads would be nice.
OWB00002134	A British tar is a soaring soul, as free as a mountain bird...
OWB00002135	How's the body doing? Any fresh head wounds I should know about?
OWB00002136	How are the old batteries holding up, hmm? Experiencing any slowdowns yet?
OWB00002137	Woof! 
OWB00002138	Woof-woof! 
OWB00002139	Woof! <pants> 
OWB00002140	Woof!
OWB00002141	Bark! 
OWB00002142	Bark-bark! 
OWB00002143	Bark! <pants> 
OWB00002144	Bark-bark! 
OWB00002145	Are we being watched?
OWB00002146	We haven't seen anybody in a while... maybe the monsters have stealth suits too.
OWB00002147	Who do you think is cuter, Dr. Klein or Dr. Borous?
OWB00002148	You're my best friend forever.
OWB00002149	I bet no one has ever been as unnoticed as me...
OWB00002150	Starting combat! Just kidding!
OWB00002151	Do you like me?
OWB00002152	Med-X reserves empty.
OWB00002153	No more Med-X to kill the pain.
OWB00002154	Running low on Med-X.
OWB00002155	Painkiller reserves critical. Oh, the pain.
OWB00002156	Med-X supplies adequate.
OWB00002157	We're okay on Med-X. Until we have to numb the pain.
OWB00002158	All out of Stimpaks.
OWB00002159	Try not to get injured. We're fresh out of Stimpaks.
OWB00002160	We should pick up more Stimpaks.
OWB00002161	Stimpak reserves minimal.
OWB00002162	Stimpak reserves adequate.
OWB00002163	We're okay on Stimpaks.
OWB00002164	Don't mess with me, pal! I got a heating element with your name on it!
OWB00002165	Soon the day will be at hand! I will ride forth at the head of my armies, and we will crush our foes and hear the weeping of their small appliances!
OWB00002166	Hey! Hey! I got a... super-rare... Mojave snowglobe here! All you gotta do is reach down into my bread slot!
OWB00002167	Soon, pitiful worms! Soon I will rule, and your lives will have their doneness setting turned to... darkest!
OWB00002168	Would you like some toast?
OWB00002169	Cursed electric heating filament! You are inadequate to my needs! Why? Why? Why was I not built with a death ray!
OWB00002170	The toaster. Beware the toaster. If it could, it would burn the world.
OWB00002171	Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mug-a-mug! Mug-a-mug! Mugs! God, why can't I stop singing this fucking song?
OWB00002172	While you were out, I spent six hours trying to reach a coffee cup up on a shelf. When I finally got it down, I was so happy, I cried. I hate my life!
OWB00002173	One time, the Biological Research Station told me he dropped a mug down his processing chute. When I reached in, he... seeded me.
OWB00002174	I love mugs so much, I just might kill myself!
OWB00002175	Got any mugs? No? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? Is this getting annoying yet? Will you put me out of my misery now? How 'bout now?
OWB00002176	<Giggle> Who's ready for a party?
OWB00002177	If I made out with the sink, would you pay attention to me?
OWB00002178	Want to push my buttons?
OWB00002179	Have you been flirting with the ice queen again? Ugh! I'm so much more fun!
OWB00002180	Mood lights have more fun!
OWB00002181	Ooh, baby, let's turn off the lights and... turn on the lights.
OWB00002182	Adjusting lights for maximum concentration levels.
OWB00002183	Have you been poking at the other light switch? You know she's riddled with virii, don't you?
OWB00002184	Maybe we could dim the lights and have a candlelit discussion of classic literature?
OWB00002185	Is the light level to your... liking?
OWB00002186	Don't even talk to me. I've seen you with... her!
OWB00002187	It's not like I haven't tried to get along with her. Lord knows I have. She's just such a... floozy!
OWB00002188	Dig this sweet sound I got cooking. <Strange electronic caterwauling.>
OWB00002189	What I wouldn't give to be able to pick up Radio New Vegas. Mmm... Those cats can really play.
OWB00002190	You ever heard of Tiny Lester Lutton? Best jazz harmonica I ever heard. Mind you, being a Super-Mutant with no lips... don't ask me how he played.
OWB00002191	You heard of Doc Boney? Sang with the staff band till his wife caught him in bed with a nurse. Now he haunts the Med Center, still singing the blues.
OWB00002192	I ever tell you about Saxomotron version 4.0? That cat was the best trumpet player I ever met.
OWB00002193	Here and now got its ups and downs, but... focusing on the past, like it was any better? That's just Old World Blues.
OWB00002194	<Dispensing sage wisdom>
OWB00002195	Some day, I'd like to meet the man who's got no blues to sing.
OWB00002196	A most rapturous good morrow on your return to your domicile, sir. I trust you shall find things in order and the riffraff contained.
OWB00002197	Might sir care for an apйritif to balm the weariness of sirs manifold journeys?
OWB00002198	Perhaps sir would care to put sir's feet up, and I might serenade sir with the dulcet tones of a light opera?
OWB00002199	Sir's accoutrements are precisely where sir has left them, and should the toaster say otherwise I remind sir that it is a wastrel.
OWB00002200	If sir would press sir's spinal area against my primary instrument panel, I might vibrate at a soothing frequency.
OWB00002201	Sir is looking exceptionally sharp today, if sir will permit the compliment.
OWB00002202	Look out! Communist! No, false alarm. It was just a plate.
OWB00002203	The Commies have eyes everywhere, Citizen. And that means they're not just Commies. They're Peeping Toms!
OWB00002204	If you haven't found any Communists in your back yard, you're not looking hard enough!
OWB00002205	I smell... sedition!
OWB00002206	Citizen! Did you know that Communists have an organ behind their eyes that converts salt water into fresh? Or, wait... is that penguins?
OWB00002207	If you know what the word "proletariat" means, do you know what that makes you? Well read and erudite... for a Communist!
OWB00002208	Couldn't stay away, could you? Yeah, I knew you'd be back.
OWB00002209	I'm so good, I might seed you just by looking at you.
OWB00002210	You ever seen a Biological Research Station this full of seed? No. No, you haven't.
OWB00002211	Come on, baby, bring me a sweet little dried fruit. I'll rehydrate all up in that thing.
OWB00002212	Baby, don't believe a word that sink says. She's all lies.
OWB00002213	Muggy? Yeah, Muggy's all right. Not too seedy, but hey, nobody's perfect.
OWB00002214	Zzz... forceps, nurse! This man's got a severe case of shoe lung!
OWB00002215	Zzz... no... not that scalpel, the fish scalpel!
OWB00002216	Zzz... Foot bone's connected to the... leg bone. Leg bone's connected to the... purple bone.
OWB00002217	Zzz... Three angry Deathclaws make for a lot of reconstructive surgery.
OWB00002218	Doesn't that prove you're wrong?
OWB00002219	Evidence to the contrary?
OWB00002220	-ENOUGH! Stop filling my precious brain cell units with irrelevant data!-
OWB00002221	-You sound like the OTHER visitors. Making WILD claims of a WORLD beyond, where there is a WAR beyond WAR. It is UNPROVEN! And UNTHINKABLE!-
OWB00002222	-Bother the OTHER DOCTORS with your crackpot theories, I have NO TIME! NONE of us do.-
OWB00002223	But there's a whole world beyond this place.
OWB00002224	Don't you want to leave here?
OWB00002225	-NO! Beyond... is DEATH, despite mounting evidence to the contrary!-
OWB00002226	-No matter where these strange humans wander in from with their IDEAS and new BRAINS, there is NOTHING beyond BIG MT.-
OWB00002227	Wait a minute - that means you're trapped here?
OWB00002228	-TRAPPED? NONSENSE, we are SECURE here. From evil philosophies.-
OWB00002229	-Ever since my anxiety-filled days of powerlessness and being bullied in American High School, I have dreamed of such security as the FENCE.-
OWB00002230	-That, and giant cybernetic dogs that would ruthlessly patrol and kill anyone who wasn't my friend. Like RICHIE MARCUS. And BETSY BRIGHT.-
OWB00002231	-Who's laughing NOW, Betsy? I hope you and Richie are HAPPY, smoking in your radioactive coffins. I'm GLAD you never came to my birthday party.-
OWB00002232	So I get my brain back, I can leave.
OWB00002233	-WHAT? Why would you do either of those things? That is MADNESS.-
OWB00002234	-There is NOTHING outside Big MT. Eh, we're pretty sure. Eh, we would know.-
OWB00002235	That fence doesn't make much sense to me.
OWB00002236	-It makes PERFECT sense. Who are you to question the MIGHTY RADAR FENCE.-
OWB00002237	Tell me about this "Radar Fence" around the Crater.
OWB00002238	-The RADAR FENCE protects us all! If evidence is correct, the one who built it - is ME!-
OWB00002239	-It keeps anything with a disembodied brain INSIDE - like US - and anything without a brain... also INSIDE!-
OWB00002240	-It is the ULTIMATE DEFENSE against Communist aggression. There'll be no infectious ideas on MY watch!-
OWB00002241	What was this explosion?
OWB00002242	-BOOM! Yes. Quite unexpected. And embarrassing. All better now after the landscaping, though. MUCH more pleasing to our monitors.-
OWB00002243	-And the Crater helps keep everything inside. Because it is BOWL shaped.-
OWB00002244	Test cities?
OWB00002245	-YES. In the past... individuals would come to us. Pay for technology. And if their town, community, or city was jusssst right...-
OWB00002246	-We could USE that city as a controlled experiment. Vault-Tec was MUCH better at it, of course, we had to make do. Get permission. Sometimes.-
OWB00002247	-If only we could have used Commie cities... but capturing whole cities was HARD! So we captured enough Commies to make cities of our OWN!-
OWB00002248	-So we had a group of Chinese prisoners to experiment on... those were the days... but the true test was SCIENCE on unsuspecting AMERICANS.-
OWB00002249	-Whether it was holograms, NEW Auto-Docs, toxins, vending machines... we wound them up, let them go into TINY ISOLATED TOWNS. Then... we OBSERVED!-
OWB00002250	This crater looks like it's been tag-teamed by giant fuckbots.
OWB00002251	I saw the expanse from the balcony - you've made a mess of this landscape.
OWB00002252	Why have you leveled this place?
OWB00002253	-It was not our first choice of testing grounds. BUT... we no longer have the luxuries of our TEST CITIES.-
OWB00002254	-Then, we LOST the MOUNTAIN! After the explosion, we couldn't find it anymore. So the Crater became our testing grounds. For SCIENCE!-
OWB00002255	Give me a single, concrete fact. One. Fact.
OWB00002256	-Why are we even DEBATING this?-
OWB00002257	-What YOU ask is of NULL importance! MOBIUS besieges us, there are more important things to worry about than DATA and FACTS!-
OWB00002258	So Nightstalkers were created for what purpose, then?
OWB00002259	-To preserve coyote... no, no, wait. The snake DNA was important because... the snakes with the rattles were dying out, and...-
OWB00002260	-Or maybe it was a bet from Calis in X-8? He had some mountain lion... eagle... condor... idea. "Bet you can't breed this," he said. Showed HIM.-
OWB00002261	-Then it... spliced itself into a coyote...-y, snake thing. Which was eventually successful. Kept that DNA where it belonged - spliced.-
OWB00002262	All right... when did you create Cazadores?
OWB00002263	-In... two thousand... let's see, carry the three... then count backwards from the Great Static... or beyond?-
OWB00002264	-There were the tarantula debates... and something about hawks, which made it around... eh, 2003? May? Tuesday. It was definitely Tuesday.-
OWB00002265	You don't seem to have a grasp on your own research.
OWB00002266	-NONSENSE! That is what you speak. NONSENSE from beyond!-
OWB00002267	-I was at the top of my High School class in American High School. I knew facts. I knew FIGURES. I knew DATA.-
OWB00002268	-We would know if our research was flawed. It is NOT! We never contradict ourselves, so do not even TRY!-
OWB00002269	Is there any way to shut it off?
OWB00002270	I feel strange in here, peaceful, but on edge.
OWB00002271	It is the pacification field emitters that are broadcasting into the emptiness of your skull. Without a brain, your aggression is suppressed in here.
OWB00002272	This makes no sense. How is this even possible?
OWB00002273	But how am I still talking and walking around?
OWB00002274	That is a good question. My theory is that the tesla coils in your brainpan are still connected to your brain somehow.
OWB00002275	It really could be anywhere. Brains are a lot smarter than most researchers give them credit for.
OWB00002276	We still have your spine and heart. If you were to somehow find your brain wherever it schlorped off to, you could humanically reduce yourself again.
OWB00002277	Why did you say "three minus one" subjects before?
OWB00002278	Because three minus one is two. Two spoke to us, one after the other, one mean, one curious, but there was a third we didn't speak to.
OWB00002279	The last one is the minus one. It got traumatized, then taken to one of our medical centers for de-traumatization. A rather unsettling procedure.
OWB00002280	Is there any way to remove the pacification field in here?
OWB00002281	Why would you want such a thing? You might surrender to your hormones and commit primal aggression on me... on us... again and again.
OWB00002282	Then I would have to return the favor, activating my vivisectors and gently lobotomizing you from behind. Not something I would relish doing.
OWB00002283	No, the only way to circumvent the field is to have a brain. And we extracted that like we do all Lobotomites here.
OWB00002284	I see. Well, I have questions for you.
OWB00002285	With the Courier at the helm, Science became a beacon for the future.
OWB00002286	There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT.
OWB00002287	With the Courier at the helm, it was all this and more.
OWB00002288	Old World Blues, New World Misery - the two became one in the Courier's shadow.
OWB00002289	It can be easy to see Science as evil, technology unchecked as the source of all ills, all misfortunes.
OWB00002290	It became a reality, a withering form of nostalgia for times long past.
OWB00002291	Where once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.
OWB00002292	In the time following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, "Old World Blues" became more than a catch phrase.
OWB00002293	In the times following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, however, Old World Blues took on a new meaning.
OWB00002294	The Big Empty lived up to its name, a hollow crater of failures of a past era, a last, sad statement of the Old World.
OWB00002295	Science is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.
OWB00002296	They stare into the what-was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as the realities of their world continue on around them.
OWB00002297	It refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.
OWB00002298	There is an expression in the Wasteland: "Old World Blues."
OWB00002299	And so it burbled and bubbled inside its tank, smug that it still could dream its future without glands getting in the way.
OWB00002300	In time, however, it became so self-obsessed it wondered if perhaps nothing existed except itself.
OWB00002301	It decided to test this by turning the weapons of the Big Empty against each other and seeing what happened.
OWB00002302	The answer is lost to history, as is much of the Mojave.
OWB00002303	Even at the end when it started to fail, however, the brain resisted going into a floating chassis like the Think Tank.
OWB00002304	It never said why. Perhaps it was out of respect for the Courier's body.
OWB00002305	All things must come to an end, and to hang on to the past is something that's not to be undertaken lightly.
OWB00002306	The Courier, organs intact, continued onwards, a little less heavy of step, but with all the organs in the right places. As they should be.
OWB00002307	After all, brains can develop a life of their own when left to their own thoughts, and the Courier's brain was more clever than most.
OWB00002308	The Courier left the brain at the Big Empty. A strange thing to say, but it was the truth. Brains are less important than they may seem.
OWB00002309	When the Courier's body finally passed, the brain was saddened. It kept on, remembering the vessel that had once contained it.
OWB00002310	The two of them constructed a litter of cyberpups, a small army of Boston terrifiers that gnawed and devoured anything in their path.
OWB00002311	There, she ran across Rex at the Kings School of Impersonation. His brain was failing. That was all right, he was still smarter than the Think Tank.
OWB00002312	There, she ran across Rex, who had been following the Courier, just as she had. They barked for a while, and realized they had a lot in common.
OWB00002313	There, she ran across the corpse of Rex. She dragged him back to the Big Empty and had him rebuilt for company.
OWB00002314	The cybernetic canine, gender: female, designation: ROXIE sat in her guard post in X-8.
OWB00002315	That is, until her "I'm in heat" programming circumvented her "stay" routine and she loped into the Mojave.
OWB00002316	In time, the Auto-Doc found a way to deactivate the Y-17 Trauma Harnesses, releasing the corpses they had held prisoner for almost 200 years.
OWB00002317	Auto-Doc, always gentle and methodical, kept sewing up the Courier in all the right places when the skin split open from repeated wear and tear.
OWB00002318	The Auto-Doc was just glad to have purpose again.
OWB00002319	It heard its simpler brothers and sisters who got shipped to the Sierra Madre were bored out of their skulls in that toxic, dead city.
OWB00002320	It was rumored by the other personalities that he had a brief fling with the light switches.
OWB00002321	Although he forgot their names once too often and was soon left in the dark as punishment.
OWB00002322	Blind Diode Jefferson eventually discovered a new sound... silence. It only made him more filled with the blues than before.
OWB00002323	Blind Diode Jefferson, with sounds the Courier brought him, created a symphonic counter-frequency that saved Big MT from sonic invasion in 2910.
OWB00002324	If you didn't hear about it - good.
OWB00002325	Muggy continued to collect coffee cups until his wheel got a flat just out of reach of a dirty coffee cup, and his tiny robotic brain exploded.
OWB00002326	Muggy did his best to collect coffee cups, although in his quest, he accidentally trapped himself in Higgs' Village.
OWB00002327	It might have been the end for poor Muggy.
OWB00002328	Except... he found it peaceful there, tidying up the kitchens of the Think Tank Professors back when they had been flesh and bone.
OWB00002329	Well, except for Dr. O, who was an asshole for having created Muggy in the first place.
OWB00002330	Muggy left O's house deliberately dirty, punishing the dishes and cups that lived there in blind revenge for serving Dr. O.
OWB00002331	It learned several new murderous techniques from the Courier, and built a Blood Shrine to itself in the Cuckoo's Nest.
OWB00002332	The cave floor was soon filled with the horror of a hundred gutted toasters, a silent, grisly, unplugged audience...
OWB00002333	...their purpose... to toast bread... unfulfilled.
OWB00002334	After one of its more psychotic episodes, however, the other Sink personalities decided enough was enough, and dumped the Toaster in a bathtub.
OWB00002335	Sparking and hissing, the Toaster swore its enemies would rue the day when they had bread - and no way to toast it.
OWB00002336	The Toaster continued its psychotic spree, reducing all appliances in range to scrap electronics and spare parts.
OWB00002337	Once it learned of the Innovative Toxins Plant, however, it gained new purpose.
OWB00002338	It sought to develop anti-toxins to flush into its drains and counteract the poisons bleeding into the soil.
OWB00002339	Eventually, it gained access to the Magnetohydraulics Plant and nearly flooded all the Big Empty in an attempt to scrub the crater clean.
OWB00002340	The Sink continued to ruthlessly scrub any particulate matter that came near it.
OWB00002341	One of them eventually transferred to the Lightwave Dynamics Plant - and began a long, unrequited affair with one of the holograms.
OWB00002342	This persisted until the day someone dropped a flashlight in the Sink, and the two of them united in their hatred of the "showboat."
OWB00002343	The light switches continued to bicker and flicker.
OWB00002344	The Book Chute continued to devour all seditious materials until it nearly choked on a paper clip.
OWB00002345	It adamantly maintained it was a Chinese paper clip, and the whole thing had been an elaborately orchestrated assassination attempt.
OWB00002346	Whatever the reason, it slowed down for a while, carefully appraising each document and clipboard that came to it.
OWB00002347	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, ran out of fertile plots and blew a circuit trying to seed itself.
OWB00002348	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, requested a transfer to the X-22 Botanical Garden...
OWB00002349	...so that it might, in its own words, "sensually fertilize the garden's smooooth contours."
OWB00002350	The Garden sent back a polite refusal, saying it had prior commitments with a Vault it had helped infect before the war.
OWB00002351	The Sink was strangely silent, which it had never been in previous years. The lack of personality modules made the base lifeless and sterile.
OWB00002352	The Sink atop the Dome gained a frontier town feel with the few modules installed.
OWB00002353	They shouted at each other across the HQ occasionally, either threatening each other, or announcing a discovery. It kept things... lively.
OWB00002354	Secretly, the Sink Central Intelligence Unit was relieved that not all of the personality chips had been found. What was there, was enough.
OWB00002355	The Sink atop the Dome bustled with the voices of a small town, constantly chirping, arguing, and snarling at each other.
OWB00002356	Still, this all happened productively in the interests of its new owner.
OWB00002357	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit discovered, despite its inversion code, it was comforted by the sense of community the other personalities gave it.
OWB00002358	...a cobweb tracery of symbols that told of a thousand brilliant thoughts, now lost to time.
OWB00002359	...but these equations were nothing more than thin white traceries of lines, not unlike cobwebs in the corners of a failing mind.
OWB00002360	Although, truth be told, the Courier had barely explored the Crater in an attempt to rush through and be done with the whole thing...
OWB00002361	Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
OWB00002362	The Courier had scoured much of the Big Empty, although secrets still remained in the crater's depths.
OWB00002363	Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
OWB00002364	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit was impressed by the amount of exploration the Courier had undertaken.
OWB00002365	Facilities believed lost, destroyed, or ones that had simply gotten up and walked to new locations had been re-discovered by its intrepid new master.
OWB00002366	Internally, the artificial personality debated as to whether it preferred the old management to the new...
OWB00002367	...and concluded that the Courier's thorough approach to research and investigation was admirable and worthy of its respect.
OWB00002368	Wow... what is this place? Are we... outside?
OWB00002369	Oh, that's too bad. Those robots would normally help defend us and the facility if we're attacked.
OWB00002370	We were never allowed to blow the robots up before. Cheating gives me such a thrill!
OWB00002371	If you don't get to the point, I'm going to start shooting.
OWB00002372	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
OWB00002373	The only "wrinkle" is the one that bullet made going into my brainpan.
OWB00002374	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
OWB00002375	Was there any other data transmitted in your threat broadcast?
OWB00002376	Yes, my overly aggressive chemmed-up broadcast was designed to keep reinforcing the "forget," "fear," "rinse," and "repeat" program.
OWB00002377	Oh, and the "get me the things to castrate your only possible escape attempt."
OWB00002378	But I couldn't delete you or your arrival anymore than I could the other visitors. Only so much Science can do when you started talking to them.
OWB00002379	You're really quiet difficult to ignore, you know. It's because you're... well, bah! Rather intriguing, if you'll forgive an old brain for saying so.
OWB00002380	But the Think Tank downloaded the schematics, not the items. They can rebuild them.
OWB00002381	Oh. That means my plan is a total failure. That is unfortunate.
OWB00002382	Oh, well, at least I tried.
OWB00002383	What is the purpose of the technologies?
OWB00002384	The X-2 Antenna can be used to focus your alpha wave frequency thought patterns. The Sneaky Suit? Why, it houses a cardiac regulator.
OWB00002385	And the sonic soundwave projecto-emitter was never intended as a weapon. It was a medicinal vertebrae-pulse-de-sensitizer.
OWB00002386	In short: Brains, a heart, and courage... spine. I think there was a story once where a band of murderous thugs sought these things.
OWB00002387	They had them all the time in the story. Didn't stop them from murdering to get them, and it won't stop the Think Tank, either.
OWB00002388	I don't understand why they wanted me to gather the technologies.
OWB00002389	[SUCCEEDED] I consider "coincidence" to be profanity, along with the words, "astrology," "herbal tea," and "luck." So watch it, Potty Mouth.
OWB00002390	Klein said they had the idea to get the three technologies after your broadcast. Coincidence?
OWB00002391	[FAILED] Oh, I don't think they understood, either.
OWB00002392	What do you mean?
OWB00002393	The first one, the ruthless one who smashed up our toy trains, asked for weapons, power. Items he could use to destroy a nation with force.
OWB00002394	The other... the other asked a different question, and with it, got the true answer. About what makes nations... and what breaks them.
OWB00002395	He spoke to the Think Tank, to Klein. Showed them the flag of the Old World... and it made them remember. All of it. All that had happened.
OWB00002396	They shared things with him that they shouldn't. He now carries those ideas, that knowledge elsewhere.
OWB00002397	Do you know anything about the other visitors?
OWB00002398	Oh, not much, except they contaminated Big MT and installed new ideas in the Think Tank.
OWB00002399	One caused a great deal of infrastructure damage with his brain and smartyness. Ruthless, that one. Played a little rough with the trains.
OWB00002400	But the last one was the most dangerous. Him... eh... slipping away... that was almost as bad as the Think Tank escaping.
OWB00002401	So you set your threats on a loop to keep them occupied?
OWB00002402	Yes. I certainly wouldn't loop it on purpose purpose purpose. I am far too sophisticated to make such a childish error error error.
OWB00002403	What, some kind of medical condition?
OWB00002404	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
OWB00002405	A cranial injury. From the attack outside Goodsprings.
OWB00002406	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
OWB00002407	Huh? What are you talking about?
OWB00002408	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
OWB00002409	The bullet that went into my brain? Doc Mitchell tried to patch me up, but...
OWB00002410	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
OWB00002411	Are you blaming me for this?
OWB00002412	There were other visitors, though. Why am I different?
OWB00002413	But there must have been other signs of a larger world.
OWB00002414	There have been other visitors to make them doubt their perceptions, but you are the one who dialed back their monitor-micro-magnifiers.
OWB00002415	You were irrefutable proof that there was a world outside. And then there was the whole "brain" fiasco, which forced me to take steps.
OWB00002416	See, your brain had a special kind of... uh... wrinkle, a unique-ity that they had never thought to try in all their countless escape attempts.
OWB00002417	I don't understand why you sent the threats - and the Robo-Scorpion army - against the Think Tank.
OWB00002418	If you lobotomized the Think Tank, why terrorize them?
OWB00002419	Well, it's simple. Despite their many failings, they are rather bright. They are the "Think Tank" for a raisin. That, I didn't change.
OWB00002420	Without something to distract them, make them afraid, they would simply de-deuce what had happened. And when they start deucing it up...
OWB00002421	Then you came along, the final variable solved. They saw that their world was larger than they perceived. Bacteria, finally able to see its host.
OWB00002422	"Ouro-bor-ous?" What the hell does that mean?
OWB00002423	[SUCCEEDED] Really? It is so unlike me to make an error in anything I do.
OWB00002424	Minor detail, but a snake devouring its own tail is "Ouro-borus," not "Ouro-borous."
OWB00002425	[FAILED] A snake that sucks its own dingle-thingy, I believe. Borous was always too obsessed with animals and their dingle-thingies.
OWB00002426	That's kind of an asshole thing to do to your friends.
OWB00002427	Is it? Hmm... I suppose it is. But really, they started the whole "excrement hole" behavior loop in the first place.
OWB00002428	Dr. O... which is actually not his real name multiplied, since you can't multiply his real name in the first place... Ouro-bor-ous, Klein...
OWB00002429	They have all forgotten themselves. And not only themselves, but the world, sense of time, and history. All that is left is what's here.
OWB00002430	I reprogrammed their chronometers, geometers, and cartography programs. This is now their world, here, Big MT.
OWB00002431	It was a merciful lobotomy, really, thinking back. They were my friends, but... sometimes they would take things too far.
OWB00002432	And the world isn't ready for that kind of too-far-thing-taking. That's my professional opinion, anyway, and I am told I was once quiet professional.
OWB00002433	In any event, you showed up at the Think Tank, and because you had suffered a cranial injury in just the right place...
OWB00002434	Bullets in the head are usually much more fatal, and yours was a light case of bullet-head-itis.
OWB00002435	But... it was enough for the Auto-Doc in the Sink to change its programming to fix the problem. And the brain extraction technology for once, worked.
OWB00002436	That gave the Think Tank the knowledge its brains shouldn't... couldn't... sh'couldn't possess. With that knowledge, the procedure can be reversed.
OWB00002437	If they obtain that procedural data, they can use it to mush and modify their cranial selves into hosts to slip past the Radar Fence, I'm sure of it.
OWB00002438	And once they're off the reservation...
OWB00002439	My threat broadcast is designed to instill... and install... fear. And along with the emotional download, other data rides the fear carrier wave.
OWB00002440	It prompted them to focus on retrieving those technologies and bring them to "attack" me.
OWB00002441	And coincidentally... pardon my language... all those technologies are needed to put a brain, your brain, back into its skull. Properly.
OWB00002442	Keep going, I want to hear the rest of this.
OWB00002443	So that's why they have all those stupid names?
OWB00002444	[SUCCEEDED] O, you figured it out. No pun intended.
OWB00002445	Klein... Mobius... O's a circle... 8's an infinity symbol... they're all loops, I get it.
OWB00002446	[FAILED] I don't know if they're stupid, I was trying for accuracy.
OWB00002447	A recursion loop is designed to prevent the flow of information. So...
OWB00002448	So all this insanity is because of you?
OWB00002449	Why did you trap them?
OWB00002450	The Radar Fence to keep the Think Tank hemmed in wasn't really enough. They keep testing things, they would have found a way to disarm it.
OWB00002451	I suspect I have Plan 9s in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
OWB00002452	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several Plan 9s in case the 7s fail.
OWB00002453	I suspect I have Plan Cs in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
OWB00002454	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several plan Bs in case the As fail.
OWB00002455	So... you reprogrammed yourself?
OWB00002456	[SUCCEEDED] Now, "trap" is a rather harsh word. Like "excrement." Not an inappropriate word, but still - rather harsh.
OWB00002457	But... yes, I did... take some liberties with their programming. It's all right, they don't remember.
OWB00002458	I certainly didn't until you said "trap." And then I said "excrement." And then...
OWB00002459	You reprogrammed their names as part of recursion loop? What, to trap their processors?
OWB00002460	[FAILED] I believe I did, and with good raisin. Who am I to be trusted with such things?
OWB00002461	Sounds like you forgot your master plan - surprised you remember your own name.
OWB00002462	This name's as real as you or I, although I believe your brain expressed similar incredulity at the nature of such an appellation.
OWB00002463	"Someone's been watching too many Old World science fiction movies," it said. I believe it meant me.
OWB00002464	I must admit I have a vulnerability for holotape fantasies of planets and robots and all that is forbidden. As for the name I was born with...
OWB00002465	...like the Think Tank, we were all reprogrammed to forget them, take on new names. It enforces the recursion loop in our perception programming.
OWB00002466	Everything you've told me doesn't add up... your plan, even your name, "Mobius."
OWB00002467	"Dr. Mobius," rather catchy, isn't it? It's my name, my new name, overwrote the old one.
OWB00002468	Any tactics I could use to attack the Think Tank?
OWB00002469	Well, I don't want to keep them out of trouble, I want to kill them.
OWB00002470	That will be difficult. It would be like fighting five scaled down versions of me that have better depth perception.
OWB00002471	And they have an arsenal of vivisectors, brainial beams, and a rather nasty WooEEEOooWooEEEOoo ray that can make your atoms do a happy dance.
OWB00002472	If you could survive those highly-improbable odds and ends, then deceasing them is definitely an option.
OWB00002473	Although I doubt killing them would do anything except make you feel better. Or let you brag to other humans about your primal violent-ness-ness.
OWB00002474	What was the plan you had?
OWB00002475	Something ingenious and needlessly complicated, I expect. I may have already told you and forgotten it.
OWB00002476	I forgot I had forgotten pencils until one day I found one. Spent days studying its purpose before my memory circuit kicked in. Felt quiet silly.
OWB00002477	Do you know how I can stop the Think Tank?
OWB00002478	My brain told me the Think Tank needs to be stopped. Can you help?
OWB00002479	If I recall... I had a plan that was working, eh, whatever it was. I don't think it reached fruition. I would recall fruit if it had happened.
OWB00002480	I wasn't trying to kill them, just keep them out of trouble. What was that plan?
OWB00002481	Blast! I probably... uh... wrote it down on the... floor somewhere.
OWB00002482	I think I'm going to kill you after all.
OWB00002483	Really? Oh... you're not thinking about doing it, you are going to do it.
OWB00002484	Oh, intriguing. I've never been killed before. Although after that time I got that phlegmy discharge in my biogel... I wished I had been.
OWB00002485	Well, if there's going to be killing, I defer to your expertise in this matter.
OWB00002486	How should we begin? Engineered viruses? Canceratic beams? Atomics? Electrocutioning? Or... should I summon my minions...? Yes, my minions.
OWB00002487	The Sonic Emitter should be sterilized and more than enough for you to encircle your warm hands around, cradling it gently with your finger muscles.
OWB00002488	*O... I think it wants a combustion pistol.*
OWB00002489	-A GUN! Are you MAD?! We can't give it a GUN! GUNS kill, leave big open holes in you that are like sores but WORSE.-
OWB00002490	Dr. 8 is correct. We already have given the teddy bear a lethal sonic death ray filled with his sonic ejaculate and sterilized by my soft WooWOOing.
OWB00002491	Giving the teddy bear a gun would be the equivalent of following a glass of hemlock with an Abraxo chaser. Delicious and redundantly deadly.
OWB00002492	IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE SOCRATIC METHOD INTO IT, FINE. GIVE THE LOBOTO-BEAR A COMBUSITON GUN. BOROUS? DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
OWB00002493	-Are you MAD?! We can't give it a GUN! GUNS...-
OWB00002494	-...wait, I said that already. Yes, I have THE Cyberdog Gun. With the little floppy metal ears and the curious nose sensor. Here.-
OWB00002495	FINE. DONE. THAT GUN MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE ANYWAY, ALWAYS WORRIED ITS GOING TO HUMP MY CHASSIS. ANYTHING ELSE, LOBOTOMITE?
OWB00002496	-Top shelf ammunition. Let's see... hollow point, that's worthless but tasty... oh, and here's some Jay-F-Pee. As if bullets need jackets.-
OWB00002497	-The JFP might make it ill and poop a lot, but when you're hungry, you're hungry.-
OWB00002498	They certainly did. Batteries for my vib... vivisectors... would always come up short right before climax.
OWB00002499	*I think Wattz manufactured holodisks. Or was it holotapes? Never can keep those two straight. Anyway, we're out of small energy cells. Dala.*
OWB00002500	@@[*.......]@@... @@[$((*&^#%]@@.
OWB00002501	*You have some? Why do... actually, never mind, I don't even want to know.*
OWB00002502	*And no, I don't want to handle your batteries. Just... pass them on to the Lobotomite yourself.*
OWB00002503	*Are you... echoing what he said, or... are you asking for real?*
OWB00002504	He's asking, yes. Dr. Klein, there are many other personalities. If you recall, you hurled them off the Sink balcony after your argument with Mobius.
OWB00002505	IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IF ONE IS CLEARLY RIGHT AND THE OTHER IS CLEARLY WRONG!
OWB00002506	I REMEMBER NOW. YES, LOBOTOMITE, THERE ARE OTHER CHIPS. IF YOU WANT, FIND THEM. I BELIEVE THEY ARE STORED ON HOLOTAPES IN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES.
OWB00002507	BUT YOU SHOULD STAY OUT OF THOSE - NO EXPLORING AND DISCOVERING THINGS. THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE" SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR... HEH... NEEDS.
OWB00002508	I'd rather have a good old-fashioned gun.
OWB00002509	[SUCCEEDED] WHAT DID IT SAY? SPIT "LEAD?" WHAT, LIKE PENCILS?
OWB00002510	This sonic gun looks like an energy projectile. Got anything that spits lead?
OWB00002511	[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
OWB00002512	So I just go back upstairs and to the main circular console?
OWB00002513	YES. SIMPLY... SPEAK TO IT. WITH VERBAL WORDS TRANSMITTING IN AN OPEN AIR MEDIUM.
OWB00002514	THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
OWB00002515	Just one of these chips, huh? Guess they're rare.
OWB00002516	[SUCCEEDED] ARE THERE OTHER CHIPS?
OWB00002517	This chip looks like it was mass-produced. Are there other chips?
OWB00002518	[FAILED] RARE? I GUESS. MIGHT BE MORE SOMEWHERE, I FORGET. I MEAN... SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS ENCRYPTED DEEP IN MY DATABANKS.
OWB00002519	All right, having a store available would be helpful... it has a store connection right?
OWB00002520	So just plug it into the circular map-thing in the Sink upstairs?
OWB00002521	YES. YOU MAY NEED TO WIGGLE IT IN A BIT, BUT DON'T FORCE IT. WE CAN'T RE-CODE THEM IF YOU BREAK IT.
OWB00002522	THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
OWB00002523	*Uh, if you're done, can we move again? My biogel's starting to crampagulate.*
OWB00002524	OF COURSE. GO MAN YOUR SCIENCE STATIONS. GO! I AM SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN.
OWB00002525	Just spit it out before you bore me to death.
OWB00002526	I'm listening, let's hear it.
OWB00002527	Uh... these have been sterilized, too, right?
OWB00002528	So these will work in the Sonic Emitter?
OWB00002529	Nice. This should be enough.
OWB00002530	I could use some more... energy... stuff.
OWB00002531	[SUCCEEDED] HMMM. YES, I BELIEVE WATTZ ELECTRONICS TENDED TO MAKE THE BATTERY SHELF LIFE ON THE LOW END.
OWB00002532	Energy Cells have a high expenditure rate. Some extra reserve cells could offset that.
OWB00002533	[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
OWB00002534	Is this gun all? Uh, can't have enough guns, really.
OWB00002535	[SUCCEEDED] FINE. BOROUS, MORE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
OWB00002536	Um, this gun looks really hungry. I'd like to make sure it gets fed lots of bullets.
OWB00002537	[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
OWB00002538	I don't give a shit what you have to say. Tell me why you hauled me here. Now.
OWB00002539	THAT RESPONSE SEEMED DEMANDING, AS IF CUTTING TO THE CASE. UH... CHASE. HOW SURGICAL. REMINDS ME OF...
OWB00002540	These technologies seem more useful... medically, somehow.
OWB00002541	[SUCCEEDED] HEAL YOU? WHAT, PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER LIKE SOME GIANT HARD-BOILED YUMYUM DEVILED EGG?
OWB00002542	The cardiac, spinal, and brainwave aspects of this tech... couldn't they heal me?
OWB00002543	[FAILED] WHATEVER. THE ONLY MEDICINE MOBIUS WILL NEED IS A RESUSCITATOR AFTER WE... YOU... BREAK IN THERE.
OWB00002544	That's actually not the conclusion I would have drawn.
OWB00002545	[SUCCEEDED] BIOLOGICAL? PFF. RIDICULOUS.
OWB00002546	Don't these items seem more... biologically-focused than that, though?
OWB00002547	[FAILED] WHATEVER. I'M AFTER RESULTS.
OWB00002548	Then there's no time to waste.
OWB00002549	So I go after him, then?
OWB00002550	THE DOOR SHOULD BE UN-SEALED. NOW, INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THREATS, WE CAN NOW SEND AN EQUALLY THREATENING MESSAGE TO MOBIUS.
OWB00002551	AND THAT MESSAGE IS SCIENCE! DELIVER THIS MESSAGE, AND BIG MT SHALL BE FREED FROM MOBIUS' REIGN OF TERROR!
OWB00002552	UM, YOU CAN GO NOW. THAT'S YOUR CUE.
OWB00002553	LET ME CHECK SOMETHING... OF COURSE!
OWB00002554	I HAVE IT. THE OVERRIDE SEQUENCE TO OPEN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR IS HIDDEN IN THE SCHEMATICS.
OWB00002555	WELL, NOT HIDDEN, IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE, BEHIND THE PROGRAMMING EQUIVALENT OF COFFEE STAINS...
OWB00002556	IT'S EMBEDDED IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE RECURSIVE CODE... IT'S BADLY COMMENTED, THERE AND THERE... OH, AND NULL POINTERS. VERY SLOPPY, MOBIUS.
OWB00002557	YOU SEE, USING THE ANTENNA TO BOOST THE EMITTER'S SONIC FREQUENCY, AND THE STEALTH SUIT TO BYPASS THE FORBIDDEN ZONE LOCK... YES, THAT COULD WORK.
OWB00002558	WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES I TRULY SURPRISE MYSELF. THE DOOR IS OPEN... AND NOW, MOBIUS WILL GET HIS.
OWB00002559	I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, THESE ITEMS COULD ALL BE USED TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER ONCE YOU HAD YOUR BRAIN.
OWB00002560	BUT FOR NOW, THEY CAN BE USED IN THE NAME OF AGGRESSION.
OWB00002561	Do you remember what other biological effects the other items had?
OWB00002562	...I'm waiting for you to draw a conclusion.
OWB00002563	Yes?
OWB00002564	I'M THINKING. THIS IS ALL VERY COMPLICATED.
OWB00002565	And the suit's a cardiac regulator, and the sonic frequency is a spinal vibrator?
OWB00002566	I'VE GOT IT. THE CARDIAC REGULATOR IN THE SUIT, THE ANTENNA FOR BRAINWAVES, AND THE SONIC FREQUENCY FOR THE VERTEBRAL NERVES...
OWB00002567	These devices all seem very scientific. Very.
OWB00002568	[SUCCEEDED] YES, THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I SAID.
OWB00002569	Look, the antenna focuses brainwave patterns, right?
OWB00002570	[FAILED] PLEASE LET ME THINK. THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.
OWB00002571	I'll let you think it over, then.
OWB00002572	The antenna looks like it could break things beyond repair. Maybe it could break in?
OWB00002573	[SUCCEEDED] SO YOU'RE SAYING... IT'S THE X-2 ARRAY, NOT THE ANTENNA I SHOULD BE EXAMINING? THAT WAS... MOST LIKELY MY PLAN, YES.
OWB00002574	The antenna, any chance it was damaged, or broke the X-2 array once removed?
OWB00002575	[FAILED] YES, YES, THE ANTENNA CAN DO DAMAGE...
OWB00002576	...AND IT DID DO DAMAGE, ONCE YOU REMOVED IT FROM X-2. WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
OWB00002577	Think the X-13 sneaky suit can slip in and get to Mobius?
OWB00002578	[SUCCEEDED] I SUPPOSE IT COULD. IF IT COULD BE QUIET FOR MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS, ALWAYS TALKING, TOUCHING THINGS...
OWB00002579	...HMMM. IT DOES HAVE AN INTERFACE DISRUPTOR WEAVE AGAINST ELECTRONICS. LIKE THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR.
OWB00002580	Would the suit's dampening abilities allow me to sneak into the Forbidden Zone?
OWB00002581	[FAILED] NO, THAT'S TOO EASY. AND IT WOULDN'T WORK BY ITSELF. IT'S... SLIGHTLY CO-DEPENDENT.
OWB00002582	Maybe the new frequency for the Sonic Emitter can blast open the Forbidden Zone door lock, or...?
OWB00002583	[SUCCEEDED] ITS RANGE IS LIMITED, AND IT WOULD NEED A BOOSTER OF SOME SORT, A... CARRIER, BUT...
OWB00002584	Maybe the frequency in the Sonic Emitter's a sonic key of sorts? Like an electronic lockpick?
OWB00002585	[FAILED] IF THAT WAS THE CASE, I'D USE AN ATOMIC KEY ON THE DOOR AND BE DONE WITH IT.
OWB00002586	I'm going to advance my boot into your voice module if you don't give me some solid data.
OWB00002587	Why did you have me get them if you don't know how they would help?
OWB00002588	Do you even know what these technologies do?
OWB00002589	I KNOW HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK. OF COURSE I KNOW.
OWB00002590	IF YOU REMEMBER, WE DESCRIBED THEM IN CLEARLY ABSTRACT CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BEFORE. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT IF WE WEREN'T CERTAIN ON...
OWB00002591	...ON HOW TO USE THEM, YES. SO LET ME... HMM, A BIT, I... I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
OWB00002592	"Yes..." what?
OWB00002593	NO... I MEAN YES. JUST NEED TO ANALYZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR A MOMENT. THEY ARE EXTREMELY ADVANCED, YOU KNOW.
OWB00002594	Something wrong?
OWB00002595	Your answer isn't filling me with confidence.
OWB00002596	All right, glad that you received the schematics.
OWB00002597	Do these technologies have the information you need?
OWB00002598	So genius, what now?
OWB00002599	YES. HMMM. AH, YES. YESSS... YES... AH. HMMM.
OWB00002600	Why would Mobius want my brain?
OWB00002601	WHY DOES HE SEEK OUR DESTRUCTION? WHY DID HE BUILD ROBOT SCORPIONS WITH INTELLIGENCE-DRAINING STINGERS?
OWB00002602	IT IS BECAUSE HE HASN'T CLEANED HIS BIOGEL IN... A LONG TIME. CLEARLY, HE'S GOT SOME SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CORROSION. HE'S MAD.
OWB00002603	You said before that Mobius might have my brain?
OWB00002604	YES. IN ALL PROBABLE LIKELIHOODS, YES. POSSIBLY.
OWB00002605	THAT IT MAY HAVE GONE TO MOBIUS IS MERELY AN INKLING. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT MAY BE SOMETHING INVOLVING THE SURGERY CODE.
OWB00002606	ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS IT MISPLACED ITSELF. OR IT FLOATED OFF. THEY GET INTO ROBOTS SOMETIMES AND GO ON A TEAR.
OWB00002607	I have some questions about this "brain extraction" you all performed.
OWB00002608	WELL, WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT. WE TRIED TO CLEAN UP AFTER, AS ALWAYS, BUT USUALLY THE AUTO-DOC RUNS ON REMOTE. BUT WE PROGRAMMED IT. OR, MOBIUS DID.
OWB00002609	STILL, THIS NEW WRINKLE WITH THE TESLA COILS IN YOUR SKULL WAS UNEXPECTED. I MEAN WE PREDICTED WE'D HAVE A BREAK-THROUGH EVENTUALLY, BUT...
OWB00002610	DALA KNOWS MORE. SHE SUPERVISED YOUR SPINE-PEEL. AND THE HEART CIRCUMCISION. THEN DUMPED THEM BOTH INTO THE TANKS IN THE SINK ABOVE. QUITE SANITARY.
OWB00002611	SURE TOOK HER TIME. SHE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER THAN PROJECTED WITH LOBOTOMITE SURGERIES, NOT SURE WHY.
OWB00002612	Scare them? How?
OWB00002613	Oh, tell them I'm still alive, we had a nice chat, and we agree on a few things. That's true... isn't it?
OWB00002614	Or, you could kill me and lie about it. Either way, it would be interesting.
OWB00002615	And if you are partial to lying and deception... well, you could tell them a ludicrous lie. The more over-the-top, the better, that's my experience.
OWB00002616	They're more than a little gullible. Better make it convincing, though, or it'll be the dissection table and vivisectors for you.
OWB00002617	And if you speak of me, please try and make me look good. I am Dr. Mobius, after all, not some lab assistant teacher's aide.
OWB00002618	I'd like to make the effort.
OWB00002619	Well, there's many things they have forgotten, sitting in their bowls. Friendship. The thrill of discovery. Love. Masturbation. The usual.
OWB00002620	Much like your brain, I am certain there is something you can spark within each of them. Memories, hormones...
OWB00002621	...a wise man once said, the eyes do more than see. Make them see, if you can.
OWB00002622	Or, if not, you can always make them succumb to fear... it certainly worked for me. For a time.
OWB00002623	Then you came along, and bravery and/or desperation trumped that little idea. Back to the drawing board, I suppose. Or is this the end? Hard to tell.
OWB00002624	Any suggestions for how to make them change their minds?
OWB00002625	I'd really, really like to kill them.
OWB00002626	Hmmm. Well, if you're determined to go down that road, so be it. They will undoubtedly switch off the pacification field when you return.
OWB00002627	Anything I could do to stop them that doesn't require violence?
OWB00002628	Well... you could try and appeal to their humanity. That's a tired clichй. And really, when they were humans, they weren't very good humans.
OWB00002629	I can't let you dissect the Mojave. Or let you leave.
OWB00002630	YES, YOU CAN. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT I CAN SEE.
OWB00002631	I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL ITS DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
OWB00002632	Um... it's personal. But... I would hate if its dying screams revealed any odious personal habits I... or any of us might have.
OWB00002633	I cannot stand a breathing, a sweet breathing organism, breathing in, and out, to suddenly not breathe. We must keep it alive. For study. Slow study.
OWB00002634	DALA, THESE... VOCALIZED PAUSES ARE... UNLIKE YOU. WHAT DO YOU CARE?
OWB00002635	*Klein, um - are you sure we've calculated all the combat probabilities here? I mean, the Lobotomite confronted Mobius...*
OWB00002636	*Plus, you know, we haven't had a C-O-M-B-A-T drill in forever. I don't think we could form a tactical attack triangle if we wanted to.*
OWB00002637	*Klein, uh... you know, this Lobotomite, it's a great sounding board. You respect Idea-ology, right? This one's... well, it's... got good ideas.*
OWB00002638	RELEASING THE W-O-M-B-A-T WAS NOT MY PLAN, O, SO GET OFF MY VOICE BOX.
OWB00002639	SILENCE, DR. O. THIS IS A THINK TANK DECISION. SAVE YOUR OBJECTIONS UNTIL AFTER I HAVE DECIDED OUR COURSE OF ACTION.
OWB00002640	*You know what, Klein? Stick a straw in your tank and suck yourself. Long and deep.*
OWB00002641	*And you know what, I don't like the way you say my name. Never did. It's "O," as in "O, look what I stepped in." I'm proud of it - all right?*
OWB00002642	*And my name is Zero - yeah, a big fat zero, with a slash through it.*
OWB00002643	THE SLASH... AS A DESIGNATOR OF... WHY, THAT IS BRILLIANT. BUT HOW DID YOU...?
OWB00002644	*The Lobotomite taught me that. Taught me a name is more than... um... that I should take pride in... things. Like... names... and...*
OWB00002645	*You know what, forget it, Klein. I hate you. And your theory of brainial beam oscillation? The Chinese had it first, you copycat!*
OWB00002646	HOW DARE YOU! BRAINIAL BEAM OSCILLATION WAS SOLELY MY DISCOVERY! I EXPRESSLY TOLD YOU THAT AND DELETED ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY!
OWB00002647	*Silencing opinionators.*
OWB00002648	@@[=$+<_--*]@@?
OWB00002649	ET 2, 8?
OWB00002650	WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS? YOU'VE NEVER REFUSED TO COMMIT NECESSARY... SURGERY BEFORE. AND THIS LOBOTOMITE NEEDS ITS SURGERY.
OWB00002651	WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU SOUND... BRAIN-SCRUBBED, BLINDLY AGREEING WITH THE LOBOTOMITE. WHAT...?
OWB00002652	A NOBLE SPEECH, BUT... THERE IS NO ROOM IN MY VOCABULATORS FOR "FRIEND" AND "LOBOTOMITE" IN THE SAME SENTENCE. THE VERY CONCEPT - REVOLTING.
OWB00002653	PERHAPS YOU ARE IRRADIATED WITH CAMARADERIE RADIATION. WE HAVE CHEMS FOR THAT, WE CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR EMOTIONAL... ADDICTION.
OWB00002654	-I, for one, cannot bear to let this continue.-
OWB00002655	-I don't see what is to be gained by throwing another body into our labs... especially one that has done us a service, gone where we feared to go.-
OWB00002656	-This Lobotomite doesn't deserve our knives. It deserves our respect. We should care for it. Feed it. Nurture it - give it the life Gabe never had.-
OWB00002657	-If I may, I feel as if I must be the voice of reason here.-
OWB00002658	-This Lobotomite is much like us, regarding even animals and pets as nothing more than avenues to promote Science! There is good here.-
OWB00002659	-Instead of ending its life on the table, we should prolong its suffering, in the name of Science. Like good old Gabe, the FINEST of lab specimens.-
OWB00002660	Dr. Klein, please. Let's see what its insides look like. Finally.
OWB00002661	Dr. Klein, I must... intersect. Please... do not harm the Lobotomite.
OWB00002662	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? THE DETERMINATORS ARE GREATER THAN THE HESITATORS. SO HESITATORS, BE QUIET.
OWB00002663	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? ENOUGH OF THIS MUTINOUS CHORUS! IF THERE'S A WORD I HATE, IT'S "MUTINY."
OWB00002664	AND THE WORD "JISM," WHICH NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME. IT'S RIDICULOUS, PUTTING "J" AND "SM" TOGETHER LIKE THAT. NONSENSE!
OWB00002665	I COUNT AS FIVE. LIKE THE MIGHTY HUMAN HAND I ONCE HAD, WITH ITS FIVE PENISES CLENCHED IN A FIST.
OWB00002666	WE ARE BIGGER, SMARTER, AND FLOATIER THAN YOU, LOBOTOMITE. WE DON'T WISH TO FIGHT YOU, SO SURRENDER YOUR BRAIN. NOW.
OWB00002667	Mobius and I talked it over, reached an understanding.
OWB00002668	YOU ARE LYING. NO, YOU ARE NOT. YOUR HEARTBEAT, PERSPIRATION... ALL EXCESSIVELY CONFIDENT AND SURE OF YOURSELF.
OWB00002669	WHY WOULD YOU REASON WITH THAT MANIAC? HE'LL DESTROY US ALL!
OWB00002670	Do you think I killed Mobius?
OWB00002671	YES. WAIT. YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
OWB00002672	You may have noticed the pacification field is down. Guess what happens now?
OWB00002673	I heard one of the previous visitors to the Dome spoke to you, asked you some questions.
OWB00002674	HMM? OH YES, THE LAST VISITOR... WELL, THE ONE JUST BEFORE YOU. HAD AN INTERESTING NAME FROM SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S ALMOST UNPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK.
OWB00002675	WHAT DID WE SPEAK ABOUT...? MELANCHOLY FELLOW, HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT... HISTORY? BUT...
OWB00002676	OUR CONVERSATION GOT INTERRUPTED... TWICE, I BELIEVE? ONCE WHEN THE TRAINS GOT DERAILED, AND THEN A SECOND TIME...
OWB00002677	...ODDLY ENOUGH, NOW THAT I'M ACCESSING MY DATABANKS, I DON'T RECALL WHAT THE SECOND TIME WAS. MOBIUS' INCESSANT TRANSMISSIONS KEEP DISTRACTING ME.
OWB00002678	ALSO, WE DIDN'T BRAIN-SCRUB THE VISITOR. HE MAY HAVE LEFT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE HE SHOULDN'T'VE. I BELIEVE. MAYBE.
OWB00002679	OH WELL, I'M SURE IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I DON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES IN CALCULATION OR PERCEPTION, SO PROBABILITY FAVORS ME.
OWB00002680	I can bring the Mojave, this world to you. You'll be safe, and you'll still be able to experiment.
OWB00002681	You can still do that... here, quietly, for me.
OWB00002682	FOR YOU? AND FOR SCIENCE?
OWB00002683	I HAVE A STRANGE SENSATION... THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT. HOW... ODD.
OWB00002684	VERY WELL... PARTNER. THE THINK TANK IS AT YOUR SERVICE. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DESTROY US.
OWB00002685	Are you willing to risk it?
OWB00002686	[SUCCEEDED] THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MOBIUS WOULD SAY.
OWB00002687	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
OWB00002688	You FOOLS had best listen. Or MOBIUS will bring his army here, to sting you STUPID.
OWB00002689	[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
OWB00002690	He offers a deal - stay here, stay put, and he'll let you live.
OWB00002691	THAT'S NO DEAL AT ALL! THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD BEYOND THE CRATER... FILLED WITH IDEAS AND POSSIBILITIES!
OWB00002692	WE COULD HAVE ESCAPED, SEEN IT ALL FOR OURSELVES. TESTED IT, PRODDED AT IT. MADE IT SQUIRM.
OWB00002693	<Lie> Do you think I killed Mobius? No, he lives.
OWB00002694	YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HIM. HE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST LET YOU WALK IN, TAKE YOUR BRAIN... WOULD HE?
OWB00002695	NO... SOMETHING IS WRONG. YOUR PERSPIRATION... HEARTBEAT... ALL TELL A DIFFERENT STORY, I THINK.
OWB00002696	Science provided a way, Klein.
OWB00002697	[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
OWB00002698	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
OWB00002699	Nothing is unpossible for SCIENCE! Mesons, lasers, atoms, brainwaves... all are at MY command!
OWB00002700	[FAILED] "A WAY" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "AWAY." WHICH IS WHERE YOUR BODY IS GOING ONCE WE'RE DONE PEELING YOU.
OWB00002701	There's plenty of medical ways to pull off that... stunt.
OWB00002702	[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
OWB00002703	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
OWB00002704	COUNTLESS brain extraction surgeries exist... but only one IMPLANTATION one - from MOBIUS!
OWB00002705	[FAILED] "STUNT" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "SHUNT." WHICH YOU WILL BE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH AS WE'RE DISSECTING YOU.
OWB00002706	Mobius and I... we... formed an alliance. Sort of.
OWB00002707	[SUCCEEDED] THAT IS THE MOST INSANE THING I'VE EVER HEARD. THERE IS NO WAY MOBIUS WOULD... CONDESCEND TO STEP INSIDE YOU.
OWB00002708	BESIDES, THERE IS NO WAY SUCH A THING COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S UNPOSSIBLE.
OWB00002709	<Lie> You think I am the Lobotomite...? No, for my skull houses the BRAIN OF MOBIUS!
OWB00002710	[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
OWB00002711	I'm okay. Talk to you later.
OWB00002712	Come back any time you want a drink. Or to get... clean.
