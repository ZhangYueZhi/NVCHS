DOD00000001	Howdy-do. Nice weather today.
DOD00000002	Stan sure is taking a while...
DOD00000003	I know you killed Stan!
DOD00000004	What, you want a tip or something? Fine, here's a tip: Fuck off.
DOD00000005	I think I'm going to have Stanny make me a model- or maybe an actress? Do you think I'd look good on a billboard?
DOD00000006	When's Stan coming back? Jansen is the worst conversationalist I've ever met.
DOD00000007	What?
DOD00000008	You're not quite as dirty as most folks who wander around back here. Looking for- Shit. Looking for anything in particular?
DOD00000009	Best keep walking, lady. Alleyways here have a way of grabbing on and never letting you go.
DOD00000010	You again... I think? Eh, you look familiar.
DOD00000011	I'm walking here, don't bother me.
DOD00000012	What's taking these whores so fucking long? These dick pills ain't gonna last all fucking day here.
DOD00000013	Hey sugar-tits, you wanna get to work on this monster for me, or what?
DOD00000014	Fuck off, loser. I'm busy here, doing shit that's so far above your comprehension, it'd blow your tiny little mind.
DOD00000015	Stop peering over my shoulder. I've got super-secret data to decompile and analyze, and you breathing on me isn't helping.
DOD00000016	Oh, got a little present for me, do you? Don't suppose that frigid bitch Morgan happened to include a love letter for me, eh?
DOD00000017	Whatever. Just hand me that briefcase and let me plug this bitch in.
DOD00000018	Oh, good, you showed up. Wasn't sure you'd be interested in some vague message.
DOD00000019	I'm specialist Morgan. So, you ready to hear what we need from you? I'm positive you'll be able to handle it without trouble.
DOD00000020	I'm busy, you're busy. Let's chat later.
DOD00000021	Got the briefcase? Good. Great, even. But the job isn't over. No, your next task...
DOD00000022	Your next task... Is to go to the room right next to mine and hand this briefcase to the hacker prick sitting at a computer.
DOD00000023	His name is Alex, and I don't like talking to him.
DOD00000024	Just hand the briefcase to Alex. It's a five-second walk, let's hustle here.
DOD00000025	Good, looking forward to getting that information decrypted. Sorry about making you speak with Alex.
DOD00000026	Unfortunately, he's picked up on the fact that he's good enough at his job that we can't quite fire him for being a twat.
DOD00000027	Whatever. Good news, you're getting paid now. Hooray.
DOD00000028	Yeah?
DOD00000029	You're the courier, I know.
DOD00000030	I'm not sure how much your contact told you, but the short version is that I've been paid a great deal to follow you around and keep you alive.
DOD00000031	Within reason, of course. I won't stalk you around without your approval.
DOD00000032	This is an unusual contract for me, I'll admit, but I think you'll find me to be quite skilled at my job.
DOD00000033	Oh, and my name is Charlie, if your contact hasn't told you that already. Shall we depart, or...?
DOD00000034	Time to work?
DOD00000035	Do you have a mission for me?
DOD00000036	What do you need?
DOD00000037	Still alive, I see. That's always promising.
DOD00000038	Yes?
DOD00000039	What?
DOD00000040	Do you need something?
DOD00000041	I have some extra stimpaks at the moment. Here, take one. I don't want you to die.
DOD00000042	Hold on, I haven't seen you before. You're not one of Dalton's people, are you?
DOD00000043	Hey, you're back. Did you... You know?
DOD00000044	Hey, I had an idea. I don't wanna worry about raiders anymore, so you should stick around here full-time.
DOD00000045	So, you should marry my sister. Think about it, you could live here, food, shelter, all that... And all you'd have to do is keep us alive forever!
DOD00000046	Heya!
DOD00000047	You should probably go talk to my sister. Keep an eye out if she starts making kissy-faces when you mention O'Neill.
DOD00000048	Whatcha want?
DOD00000049	There better be a good reason for you to be on our property, stranger. Why'd Maggie let you in?
DOD00000050	Still around, I see.
DOD00000051	Alright, who are you, and what do you want?
DOD00000052	Ha, the fuck is this?
DOD00000053	You come looking for the biggest dick in the Mojave, sweetheart? Well you're in luck. Come sit on Dalton's lap and let him tell you all about it.
DOD00000054	You again? The fuck you want now?
DOD00000055	No sudden movements, friend. Keep it calm.
DOD00000056	The fuck you want with me?
DOD00000057	Yeah, yeah? What?
DOD00000058	What's up?
DOD00000059	Hold up hold up hold up. I can see you got something to say, but you have gotta get a load of this. I fucking love it.
DOD00000060	Remember Adam Burke, the child-raper that you got arrested? Hallelujah, he's a fucking corpse!
DOD00000061	You Eddie's friend? Yeah, I guess you must be.
DOD00000062	He left to meet with someone named Blake. He wanted me to let you know that the sit-down would be in that old train station near the REPCONN HQ.
DOD00000063	You Eddie's friend? Wait, hold on, I recognize you...
DOD00000064	Yeah, you're the one that Rivas patched in, aren't you? Well, I'm glad Eddie isn't trusting all this with some random outsider.
DOD00000065	He left to meet with someone named Blake. He wanted me to let you know that the sit-down would be in that old train station near the REPCONN HQ.
DOD00000066	Yo.
DOD00000067	So, I heard you were looking for me.
DOD00000068	I also heard that... I got caught and arrested, and I'm being interrogated viciously, for any kind of covert intelligence I might be sitting on.
DOD00000069	It's a good story. They got somebody with my name, that's true.
DOD00000070	I'm not asking you for anything. See, before whoever done Hurst in... Dealt with him...
DOD00000071	He managed to make a little deposit in one of my dead drops.
DOD00000072	I know what you two were investigating. I think you were onto something interesting, oh yeah.
DOD00000073	I don't want anything from you, and I'm not offering you anything. I just thought I'd let you know. I'm aware of things, and I'm still out there.
DOD00000074	I'll be in touch. I can promise you that.
DOD00000075	The fuck you want? I could... I could kick your ass, man. Just, not right now... Gotta piss first.
DOD00000076	Hey sweetheart, looking for love? I was banging a hooker once, then I blacked out and pissed myself. Sit on my lap and I'll tell you about it.
DOD00000077	What?
DOD00000078	Leave me alone. I just wanna sleep forever.
DOD00000079	Delivery.
DOD00000080	Hey, if you're hearing this line, it means I bugged out. Again. Because I'm a glitchy cunt and I refuse to just fucking function. Please kill me!
DOD00000081	What?
DOD00000082	Oh, thank god you came! I was worried y'all might not have got my message!
DOD00000083	I don't know how else to say this, so I'll just be blunt. A little back, some piece-of-shit murderer came to my family's ranch.
DOD00000084	It was a massacre. My kin, they tried to defend their land, but one by one, they died. Murdered, for no reason I can figure.
DOD00000085	But now you're here, we finally have a chance to respond to this crime. My family will be avenged, and I'll see justice done!
DOD00000086	Oh, shit, I done forgot to introduce myself. Sorry about that.
DOD00000087	My name is Scooter Bodean, and this here is for my pappy. Come on out, boys!
DOD00000088	Howdy pardner! I got a letter for you!
DOD00000089	Yeah, what? Not meaning to be rude, but I'm pretty busy here.
DOD00000090	Yep.
DOD00000091	And you're back.
DOD00000092	What's up?
DOD00000093	You're back. Where's Luisa?
DOD00000094	Oh, good. Another stranger's come barging into my home, uninvited and unannounced.
DOD00000095	What do you want? And if you say "revenge", I got a ditch out back full of the bones of the last hundred idiots to gimme that answer.
DOD00000096	You're back, and somehow I haven't dropped dead since last time we spoke.
DOD00000097	You went through a lot of trouble to get in here. So, persistent scavenger, or are you here for me?
DOD00000098	...
DOD00000099	Hello and welcome to Path of Light Ministries, my name is Monica, what can I do for you today?
DOD00000100	Hello, welcome back. How can I help you?
DOD00000101	What?
DOD00000102	I have to admit, I didn't think I'd be seeing you again. You cut through my entire security team, Carter included.
DOD00000103	It's impressive, I'll grant you. But, all you've managed to do is piss me off. Do you know what I did to the last man to piss me off?
DOD00000104	I threw him, and his buddy, into a metal shipping crate, out in the middle of the desert.
DOD00000105	I sealed it up tight, with just a little space for air to seep in. Suffocation was too quick. No, I let them cook and starve in that thing.
DOD00000106	Can you imagine? Day after day, locked in a tiny, dark, sweltering little space... It's an agonizing death. That's why I enjoy it.
DOD00000107	That is the fate of those who test my resolve. You may as well shoot yourself, because what I have planned for you is far worse.
DOD00000108	...
DOD00000109	I'm destroying evidence! If you must kill me, at least make sure this room is completely purged!
DOD00000110	Wait a moment... You're not one of Brecker's... You're that courier!
DOD00000111	They all want you dead. I am collateral, you're the primary target. They'd never kill the man who cut you down!
DOD00000112	Praise him, your death shall redeem me, your blood shall purify me. Die with me down here, little moth.
DOD00000113	Goddamn hydraulic doors. I keep telling people, just tear these things out, replace 'em with normal doors. Gotta be the third time this month...
DOD00000114	Yes, can I help you with something?
DOD00000115	Hello, hello! I'm Reverend Austin Burke, it's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat.
DOD00000116	I've heard a great deal about you. Seems a great many people in the Mojave owe you a debt. Now, what is it I can do for you today?
DOD00000117	Good to see you again. What can I do for you?
DOD00000118	I don't think you're supposed to be here. If you could see yourself out, please...?
DOD00000119	So, you're the oh-so-badass courier, huh? You've really screwed up this operation for us. Thanks for that, friend.
DOD00000120	There you are!
DOD00000121	Running around Powder Gang territory, bold as you please? Not entirely sure that's wise.
DOD00000122	That isn't a threat, mind you. I'm just saying, some of these guys are a touch unhinged. Keep your gun loaded, right?
DOD00000123	So, you need something, or what?
DOD00000124	Uh, no offense intended, but Powder Gang territory isn't a great place for a woman to be running around, all carefree and such.
DOD00000125	Lot of these guys haven't touched a woman since they first got locked up. Not me, mind you, but I'm charming.
DOD00000126	Some of 'em might see you as an invitation, alls I'm saying.
DOD00000127	Yeah?
DOD00000128	I'm on my way towards Freeside. If I can make it there without getting killed, I think I can do alright for myself.
DOD00000129	Pleasure to see you again.
DOD00000130	Ah, you again. Ready to surrender a small mountain of your cash over to me, in the promise of getting an even larger mountain back in the future?
DOD00000131	Price is ten grand. Return investment is gargantuan and impressive, an aspect it has in common with my johnson.
DOD00000132	Oh, hey, buddy, over here. Yeah, you. Right here.
DOD00000133	Yeah, great. Enjoying the casino? Maybe winning big, huh? Come in here for a break, spend some of your winnings on food and drink, yeah?
DOD00000134	Now, I see a person in a casino, I figure they must like making money, huh? Well, maybe not Gomorrah, in which case probably just like naked folks.
DOD00000135	Anyway, my original point: Money. Happens that I can make you and me rich, right? Partners style. How's that sound?
DOD00000136	Tread carefully.
DOD00000137	Never had much use for mines, myself.
DOD00000138	I'll remember that's there.
DOD00000139	...Is there a point to this, or...?
DOD00000140	What the fuck are you doing?
DOD00000141	Well, go ahead and pull the trigger if it'll make you feel better. I don't care, either way.
DOD00000142	I really don't care.
DOD00000143	Yep, always more work to do.
DOD00000144	Yep.
DOD00000145	Uh-huh.
DOD00000146	The fuck is so good about it?
DOD00000147	Goodbye.
DOD00000148	Sure, later.
DOD00000149	Take care of yourself, brother.
DOD00000150	Take care of yourself, sister.
DOD00000151	Yeah, yeah. Another time, sure.
DOD00000152	No doubt we'll speak later.
DOD00000153	I should go.
DOD00000154	Whatever.
DOD00000155	Yep. See you when I see you.
DOD00000156	Yeah yeah, get fucked.
DOD00000157	See ya!
DOD00000158	Alright, bye.
DOD00000159	Adios amigo.
DOD00000160	Adios.
DOD00000161	Have a nice day.
DOD00000162	And I don't suppose you would be willing to disembowel yourself, and save me the trouble. No? Guess we'll settle it the old fashioned way.
DOD00000163	I don't suppose I could convince you to see reason?
DOD00000164	I have better things to do, anyway.
DOD00000165	Good luck on your adventures. You'll be in my thoughts.
DOD00000166	Have a nice day.
DOD00000167	Adios. Keep an eye out for fiends. They're lurking around this area.
DOD00000168	I could make this quick and painless... But I won't.
DOD00000169	(Creepy chuckle)
DOD00000170	You're going to struggle? Fine.
DOD00000171	You're just another number to me.
DOD00000172	You died the moment I laid eyes on you.
DOD00000173	I do this for a living. What chance do you have?
DOD00000174	Kill them all.
DOD00000175	You've breathed your last.
DOD00000176	Die.
DOD00000177	Good kill.
DOD00000178	(creepy chuckle)
DOD00000179	Well done.
DOD00000180	Hmph.
DOD00000181	Frag out.
DOD00000182	Careful.
DOD00000183	Heads up.
DOD00000184	They must be getting desperate...
DOD00000185	I'll kill you all.
DOD00000186	(Creepy chuckle)
DOD00000187	No mercy.
DOD00000188	You're already dead.
DOD00000189	Are you going to struggle? It won't help.
DOD00000190	I do this for a living, you know.
DOD00000191	You can scream if you like. It won't make any difference.
DOD00000192	Kill them all.
DOD00000193	This will get bloody. Heh.
DOD00000194	Target spotted.
DOD00000195	...
DOD00000196	Target spotted.
DOD00000197	In my sights.
DOD00000198	Dead man walking.
DOD00000199	Eyes sharp.
DOD00000200	Someone is trying to sneak up on us. Pfft.
DOD00000201	Weapons ready.
DOD00000202	Safeties off.
DOD00000203	Hmm.
DOD00000204	Relax... For the moment.
DOD00000205	Scared them off. That's why I prefer attacking from shadows.
DOD00000206	Targets silenced.
DOD00000207	Targets silenced.
DOD00000208	I feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
DOD00000209	Hm. You won't be remembered.
DOD00000210	If I carved a notch for each kill, there would be nothing left of my poor blade.
DOD00000211	You deserved worse.
DOD00000212	How disappointing.
DOD00000213	Was that all?
DOD00000214	Targets eliminated.
DOD00000215	You think running will save you? Heh.
DOD00000216	You fucking coward.
DOD00000217	Run, hide, beg... Nothing will save you.
DOD00000218	I can smell your fear...
DOD00000219	You'll never escape me.
DOD00000220	My face will be the last thing you ever see.
DOD00000221	...
DOD00000222	...Pathetic.
DOD00000223	Nobody can hide from me.
DOD00000224	This may hurt more than you expected. Price of wasting my time.
DOD00000225	(Ominous chuckle)
DOD00000226	I always kill my targets.
DOD00000227	Good, let's continue.
DOD00000228	Don't get distracted.
DOD00000229	Show yourself.
DOD00000230	We're not alone.
DOD00000231	They think they can hide from death. Cute.
DOD00000232	Ugh. Craven.
DOD00000233	I can make your end quick and painless. If I have to search for you... I won't.
DOD00000234	I don't leave survivors. May as well stop wasting time.
DOD00000235	There aren't many things I care enough to hate... But cowards are one of them.
DOD00000236	Make me search much longer, and I'll pay your family a visit. Free of charge.
DOD00000237	Heh.
DOD00000238	Wherever you're going, I've ensured you won't want for company.
DOD00000239	I had to wait three days for a target to walk by his window, once.
DOD00000240	Understood.
DOD00000241	If you say so.
DOD00000242	Alright.
DOD00000243	If you'd like.
DOD00000244	I think I have everything I need, but, very well.
DOD00000245	Understood.
DOD00000246	I make most of my kills at a distance anyway.
DOD00000247	Simple enough.
DOD00000248	Of course.
DOD00000249	I wasn't aware I was such a riveting conversationalist.
DOD00000250	I'm not much for wandering anyway.
DOD00000251	I'll keep close.
DOD00000252	At your discretion.
DOD00000253	That would be my preference, as well.
DOD00000254	Blades are well and good, but I prefer to kill efficiently, all the same.
DOD00000255	Roger that.
DOD00000256	...I'm... Already using a gun, thank you.
DOD00000257	Simple enough. I'm quite handy with a blade.
DOD00000258	If that's your preference, I can adapt.
DOD00000259	I'd be a poor assassin if I could only use a gun.
DOD00000260	I'm... already using one.
DOD00000261	We can speak for as long as you'd like, though I'm not sure why you would want to speak with me for so long.
DOD00000262	Understood.
DOD00000263	That can be done.
DOD00000264	You'll find I'm quite adaptable. What would you like to discuss?
DOD00000265	After you.
DOD00000266	Roger that.
DOD00000267	Are you certain?
DOD00000268	I'm at your command.
DOD00000269	As you say.
DOD00000270	Good, it's easier to keep you alive if I'm nearby.
DOD00000271	Don't play with my emotions like that.
DOD00000272	Very well. I'll likely be at my Freeside safehouse, if you require my services again.
DOD00000273	Hmm. I'll be waiting at my Freeside safehouse, in that case. You won't have me waiting for too long, I hope.
DOD00000274	If anyone recognizes the utility of solo ops, it's me. I'll be at my safehouse in Freeside, then.
DOD00000275	Very well.
DOD00000276	Understood.
DOD00000277	I'm not an impatient killer. I can wait as long as is necessary.
DOD00000278	Simple enough. They'll all die, one way or another.
DOD00000279	That's what I do best.
DOD00000280	Killing them before they even know I'm there is my stock and trade.
DOD00000281	Interesting... Very well, I'll be there.
DOD00000282	Well, it won't be overly difficult to find my way there, at least. I'll be waiting.
DOD00000283	It lacks subtlety, but I'll concede that it's very defensible. I'll be waiting.
DOD00000284	Hmm, seems this one can fight.
DOD00000285	(Calm breath)
DOD00000286	Hmm, bleeding badly. Usually the other way around.
DOD00000287	Seems I'm really taking my time with you.
DOD00000288	I'm not impressed.
DOD00000289	Some stims would be appreciated.
DOD00000290	This is why I prefer stealth killing.
DOD00000291	Seems I made a mistake.
DOD00000292	That was careless.
DOD00000293	What's wrong with me?
DOD00000294	Did you complete the mission?
DOD00000295	So you drew some blood. You're hardly the first.
DOD00000296	I don't owe you a quick death.
DOD00000297	If I actually considered you a threat, you'd already be dead.
DOD00000298	So, you'll suffer before you die.
DOD00000299	You're just prolonging your own suffering.
DOD00000300	My weapon broke. Is this what grief feels like?
DOD00000301	Shoddy equipment. Don't know why I bother...
DOD00000302	Good thing I have a spare. Several, in fact.
DOD00000303	That was the last.
DOD00000304	As if that's my only method of killing. Heh.
DOD00000305	Switching weapons.
DOD00000306	I know how to take a body apart, seems I can put it back together, too.
DOD00000307	I know someone who's going to need this more than me...
DOD00000308	First aid, my true calling.
DOD00000309	Slowing me down will only make your death more agonizing.
DOD00000310	May have a new scar. Lucky me.
DOD00000311	That's been broken before. I lived... You won't.
DOD00000312	That's a bit better.
DOD00000313	Thanks.
DOD00000314	Ah, syringes, my old friend.
DOD00000315	You realize I'm an assassin, not a pack animal, yes?
DOD00000316	Don't be ridiculous.
DOD00000317	To be clear, I'm here to kill your enemies, not cart your junk collection around.
DOD00000318	Hmm.
DOD00000319	In my element.
DOD00000320	Heh.
DOD00000321	Not a problem. So, what can I do for you?
DOD00000322	Thanks for the warning.
DOD00000323	I don't doubt it. All the same, there's something to be said for avoiding danger all together, when it can be helped.
DOD00000324	It's your ass, literally, that's all. Anyway, you need something?
DOD00000325	I can handle myself.
DOD00000326	You know what? I think you're fine without my warnings. I'll reserve my pity for anyone that gets in your way, I think.
DOD00000327	Now, with the understanding that I have no intentions of provoking you, uh, is there anything you need?
DOD00000328	They're free to try, and I'm free to mount their head on a pike if they do.
DOD00000329	'Cause I've got more than two brain cells to rub together, unlike Eddie and his boys.
DOD00000330	Just because the NCR hasn't wiped that place off the map yet doesn't mean they won't later.
DOD00000331	When that happens, I don't intend to get my ass caught in the crossfire, you know?
DOD00000332	Why are you hanging out here, instead of back at the prison?
DOD00000333	You serious? I had that place pegged as a deathtrap as soon as the riot was over. I told 'em, y'know, get out while you still can.
DOD00000334	Now I've been proven right, and you think I should waltz back on over there? I'd rather not, thanks.
DOD00000335	Why are you hanging out here, instead of back at the prison?
DOD00000336	Am I a Powder Ganger, though? Sure, I'm an escaped con, I got this nifty prison shirt on, and some dynamite in my pocket, but...
DOD00000337	Thing is, I'm not interested in robbing people, or blowing people up, or any of that other shit. So, I'm not sure I am a Powder Ganger, not really.
DOD00000338	You seem pretty relaxed, for a Powder Ganger.
DOD00000339	Well, to be fair, overpopulation was the second biggest cause of the riot in the first place. The biggest was that we had dynamite.
DOD00000340	But, yeah, you're not wrong. Thing is, random wasteland toughs are drifting in and joining up, even though they haven't done any time.
DOD00000341	They see it as indistinguishable from any other gang, and they're not exactly wrong.
DOD00000342	It's like how the Khans used to be a contingent of angry vaulters, but over time, new blood joined, founding members died, now it's something new.
DOD00000343	Give it enough time, Powder Gang will stop being escaped cons, and it'll turn into a big gang that likes bombs and the color blue.
DOD00000344	Not that they'll last that long. They're poorly armed, surrounded by enemies on all sides, and no real unification. Oh well, they won't be missed.
DOD00000345	NCRCF wasn't that big, but it seems like there's no shortage of Powder Gangers. What's up with that?
DOD00000346	Ah, well, that's not a story that reflects especially well on me, you understand?
DOD00000347	Not in the sense that I'm some kinda dangerous lunatic, but, well, it's stupid.
DOD00000348	So, I was seeing this girl, right? And she was... Hmm, how to put this delicately...? "Accustomed to a certain level of affluence in her life."
DOD00000349	I wanted to keep her around, so to finance her preferred lifestyle, I may have, you know, sold things that I had no right to, yes?
DOD00000350	And when someone noticed they were bereft of their earthly possessions, they pointed out "Hey, Massey suddenly has a lot of cash for a dirt farmer".
DOD00000351	Told you, it was stupid and makes me look bad. Still, I'd rather look like an idiot than a psychopath like my cellmate, Darby.
DOD00000352	So, what were you in jail for?
DOD00000353	He shouldn't have even been in prison. Seems to me that the noose was invented for men like him.
DOD00000354	He was locked up for murdering his family. I know this, because he liked to brag about it.
DOD00000355	He talked about how he beat his son to death with a length of pipe, same way normal people would talk about the goddamn weather.
DOD00000356	One night, no reason at all, he just stares me down. Says: "Want to know something funny? I know where he lives, the sheriff that caught me."
DOD00000357	I don't much like the notion that he's alive out there, but I figure he must be. Took off with a little gang and headed west.
DOD00000358	Tell me about this cellmate of yours.
DOD00000359	I'm chief of security around here. Someone has to keep raiders out of here, and that's me.
DOD00000360	You'd think the reverend would rely on God for protection. Instead, he asked me. That should tell you all you need to know.
DOD00000361	What do you do here?
DOD00000362	I would be happy to answer however I can.
DOD00000363	I have some questions.
DOD00000364	Well, what you're looking at right now is only the New Vegas branch of our organization. It was only established in '78, you see.
DOD00000365	Our organization was founded to assist orphans and refugees with nowhere else to go, to assist and empower communities in both body and spirit.
DOD00000366	We do a lot of outreach to poorer areas, where people may not have access to all the amenities of Shady Sands.
DOD00000367	While we do coordinate some charitable efforts alongside the Followers of the Apocalypse, we make an effort to go on our own path.
DOD00000368	The Followers do good work, but they tend to focus on science and medicine. We think it is vital to provide evangelical alternatives, when possible.
DOD00000369	Tell me about Path of Light.
DOD00000370	The organization was founded by the Reverend Austin Burke, back in California in 2250.
DOD00000371	The Burkes have always been a very wealthy and influential family, back West. The Reverend chose to put his resources forward to help his community.
DOD00000372	His cousin is actually a member of the Senate, though we try to leave politics to the politicians.
DOD00000373	After hearing about the plight facing the poor people of the Mojave, Reverend Burke wasted no time in establishing this branch.
DOD00000374	He has made it very clear that he will stay on as the administrator for this region, until it is fully integrated into the NCR.
DOD00000375	How did the ministry come about?
DOD00000376	I'm Monica Nelson. I've been with the program for most of my life.
DOD00000377	The ministries make it a priority to take in orphans, like myself, and provide food, safety, and education.
DOD00000378	I could have left after I graduated, but I felt I owed them a debt, so I stayed on.
DOD00000379	With the Mojave in the state that it is, it needs all the help we can give. I'm very proud to be a part of that.
DOD00000380	And who, exactly, are you?
DOD00000381	I'm sorry, I'm afraid he's quite busy at the moment. If you'd like to try again later, he may or may not be available.
DOD00000382	I need to speak with Reverend Burke. It's important.
DOD00000383	One moment, let me see if he's available.
DOD00000384	...
DOD00000385	Yes, he's available at the moment. I'll unlock the door for you. You can find him in his office, in the door to my left.
DOD00000386	I need to speak with Reverend Burke. It's important.
DOD00000387	Ahh, you're referring to that business with the senator's son, yes?
DOD00000388	That was very... unfortunate.
DOD00000389	However, that had nothing to do with our ministries, or really any part of the Burke family, beyond Adam himself.
DOD00000390	It's not really fair to the Reverend, and his history of philanthropy should speak for itself. Was there anything else?
DOD00000391	The Burke family has been in the news lately. Don't suppose the Reverend has any insight?
DOD00000392	Name's Ryan. O'Neill. I'm with the Westside militia, if the fact that I'm defending their perimeter wasn't clear enough about that.
DOD00000393	Who are you?
DOD00000394	Me? Why, I'm the funniest man in Westside. Everyone looks at me, they see a funny joke and they just laugh and fucking laugh.
DOD00000395	Shit, ask my wife. She married me for a laugh, and she sucks fat cocks for a handful of caps. What a fucking inspiration.
DOD00000396	I can do magic, too. Gimme booze and I'll make that shit disappear in an instant, motherfucker.
DOD00000397	Who are you?
DOD00000398	Of course I don't mind you asking. Why, I'm only here to relive my horrible past for the amusement of you wretched cunts.
DOD00000399	I told him a thousand times, don't go past the goddamn wall without supervision. So what does he do as soon as he gets the chance? Of fucking course.
DOD00000400	Not like he was the first kid to get shot to shit by Fiends. And his fucking bitch of a mother...
DOD00000401	She fucking blamed me, said it was all my fucking fault and that was reason enough to leave me. She was just looking for an excuse.
DOD00000402	She was selling her bony ass to anyone with two caps to scrape together. Sure, blame me for what happened. At least I was fucking there.
DOD00000403	Where was she when our firstborn was getting murdered, huh? Sucking cock for cash. But I'm the only one at fault, huh?
DOD00000404	Well, fuck her, fuck her fucking clients, fuck this goddamn shithole slum of a fucking town, fuck the Fiends, fuck their victims, and fuck you too.
DOD00000405	Now get the fuck out of my face, and don't ever fucking ask me about this shit again.
DOD00000406	What happened to your son, if you don't mind my asking?
DOD00000407	What, is that supposed to slap me back into giving a fuck? Like I've been dazed and confused this whole time?
DOD00000408	I know what I am, motherfucker. I'm wide fucking awake. See, I'm a drunken fucking degenerate. I was a shit dad and a shit husband.
DOD00000409	Jessie's brother is dead, her mother is a fucking whore, her hometown is a gutter where all the junkies, sluts, slavers, and psychos accumulate.
DOD00000410	The world is ugly and cruel. Every day, I wake up and pray to god that this one will be the last.
DOD00000411	You and Ryan and your type... You stand there on the edge, staring at the worst shit that life has to offer, and you tell yourself "it's not so bad."
DOD00000412	So don't fucking ask me what my problem is, when you're the motherfucker deluding yourself about how things are.
DOD00000413	What's your problem? This is your daughter we're talking about, and you don't give a shit about her.
DOD00000414	I drink as much as I can, I get in fights, sometimes I manage to scrounge up enough to get a cheap hooker.
DOD00000415	That's it. Maybe you're all special enough to have things worth noting in your life, but me, I got fuckall.
DOD00000416	So, what do you do around here?
DOD00000417	Not once in my entire fucking life.
DOD00000418	Why the fuck would I ever volunteer to help defend these fucking ungrateful rat-bastards?
DOD00000419	In case you haven't noticed, I fucking hate this place, and I fucking hate these people. Fuck 'em all.
DOD00000420	Have you ever considered joining the militia?
DOD00000421	Easy. I've killed a lot of human garbage in my day, so when you get one name that stands out above all the rest, it'll stick with you.
DOD00000422	This was about 40 years back. Got a contract on some asshole named Warren. Outlaw ringleader, the usual type of scumbag.
DOD00000423	Good place to start looking is home, so I head to his place, find his wife. But she don't wanna open the door and let me in.
DOD00000424	Okay, easy enough, I figure. She's sheltering his ass. So, I kick in the door, bitch gets thrown off her feet, whatever.
DOD00000425	That house... It was all cages and cells. Turns out Warren's stint as a fugitive involved cutting his wife off. No more cash, no more support.
DOD00000426	So, she gets the brilliant idea to turn into a real humanitarian. Started offering room and board to refugees, orphans, addicts... Anyone weak.
DOD00000427	This evil cunt started a slaving ring the second her man stopped funding her ass. And she seemed... proud. Like it was real quick thinking.
DOD00000428	I disemboweled that evil bitch right then and there, then I sat on the couch and watched her bleed out, just to be sure.
DOD00000429	So, there you go. Worst person I ever dealt with, and she weren't even my target.
DOD00000430	Who's the worst person you ever took on?
DOD00000431	Oh, yeah, eventually. He was cowering up near Mesquite. Had us a nice little Mexican standoff, 'til I told him what his bitch wife did.
DOD00000432	He was stunned, guess he still had an ounce of humanity, so that news pretty much broke his spirit right there.
DOD00000433	He put his gun down, and I (euphemism for killing) fulfilled my contract, and that was the end of that.
DOD00000434	Did you ever catch up to Warren?
DOD00000435	Okay, shoot.
DOD00000436	I had other questions.
DOD00000437	Men specific, or are you generalizing? Either way, it's a damn high number.
DOD00000438	More men than women, for sure. Although, the gap between those two numbers is narrower than you might expect.
DOD00000439	Despite how many of 'em are rapers, seems like most outlaw bands aren't too discriminatory with their hiring policies. Weird, but whatever.
DOD00000440	As to your original question... Fuck if I know. Number's too high to keep track of, and that was before my decrepit ass started going senile.
DOD00000441	How many men have you killed?
DOD00000442	Shit, I got him into this business. Taught him how to operate, didn't I? I was in my prime and he was just getting started, so he wanted advice.
DOD00000443	He was a bit arrogant. Always smirking, like he knew something we didn't. Still, boy was a natural shootist, and pretty good with a blade.
DOD00000444	He always had a bit of ice in his blood, I recall. Some folks would go out of their way to bring their targets alive. Caleb would only ask once.
DOD00000445	Wasn't too surprised with the direction he went, after what happened to him. Everyone has a breaking point, and he wasn't the suicidal type.
DOD00000446	What can you tell me about Alquist?
DOD00000447	He had a wife; Jenny. Real pretty girl, big brown eyes. Quick, too. She was about as sharp as they come, was easy to see.
DOD00000448	Before too long, they had a daughter, too. Problem was, well... Like I said, he was arrogant. He liked to show Jenny off, flaunt how good he had it.
DOD00000449	You get yourself into the murder-for-hire trade, eventually someone will come looking for payback, as Caleb learned to his sorrow.
DOD00000450	A couple slavers he made destitute came calling. Shot up his home. He didn't get hit, but Jenny died in his arms.
DOD00000451	He buried her, then he buried the slavers. Then he said he was in no position to raise a kid, gave his girl to his brother, after I refused.
DOD00000452	After that, I stopped seeing him around much. Got himself a reputation for taking high-risk jobs with ruthless efficiency.
DOD00000453	I know that shit that went down in Brighton shocked quite a few people, but I saw the writing on the wall pretty much as soon as Jenny died.
DOD00000454	What do you mean? What happened to Alquist?
DOD00000455	Eh, he said he didn't want her to be hurt by his work, like her ma was. Said he was nothing more than a killer, weren't fit to raise that girl.
DOD00000456	I'm sure he'd still say so if you asked him, but I think keeping her around hurt him too much. She was a constant reminder of his loss, you know?
DOD00000457	See, that poor girl was the spitting image of her mother.
DOD00000458	Why did Alquist abandon his daughter like that?
DOD00000459	Joe? He was an odd one, I'll say that much. Too mercurial to be a professional, and too good at his job to be anything else.
DOD00000460	Man sure was angry, that's for sure. He could break the bank at every casino on the Strip, and still find something to be irritable about.
DOD00000461	Last I heard, he was trying to set up his own business. Offered me a place, but I told him, I'm closer to 80 than 70. My killing days are done.
DOD00000462	What can you tell me about Tully?
DOD00000463	Could do worse for yourself, I'd reckon. Joe never struck me as the greedy sort. I figure he'd pay a fair wage for a job well done.
DOD00000464	I've actually done some headhunting for Tully.
DOD00000465	About as well as can be expected, given the circumstances.
DOD00000466	That is to say, not good. Too many ravening lunatics outside our wall, and too few of us to hold them off forever.
DOD00000467	How are things in Westside at the moment?
DOD00000468	Could be worse. Actually, way I hear it, you're the one behind that. I understand you cleared Maddie's little hit list. Good work.
DOD00000469	Granted, it was only three people. Objectively it might not make much difference, but trust me, morale is higher with wins like that.
DOD00000470	How are things in Westside at the moment?
DOD00000471	Well, now you're in for it. Best get ready to work yourself into an early grave, because there's a mountain of shit that needs to be done.
DOD00000472	Let's start off with something simple. Some Scorpion prick managed to waylay a courier that was supposed to bring us a crate of seeds.
DOD00000473	Our crops are keeping us self-sufficient, for the moment. So the more crops we can grow, the better. And we already paid for these seeds, damn it.
DOD00000474	So if you could jog over to Monte Carlo and retrieve the shipment, that'd be great. Good luck.
DOD00000475	Is there anything I can do to help out?
DOD00000476	Wait, that was you?
DOD00000477	I got a message from Tully saying that my contract had been completed, but he didn't really go into any detail beyond that.
DOD00000478	Well, thanks. Always trying to do my part to keep things orderly. Even if I have to pay out of my own pocket.
DOD00000479	Ryan O'Neill? Did you put a hit out on that Johnny Norton guy? Because I killed him.
DOD00000480	Wait, that was you?
DOD00000481	I got a message from Tully saying that my contract had been completed, but he didn't really go into any detail beyond that.
DOD00000482	I wouldn't have cared much if those inbred freaks kept to themselves, but no, they just had to attack travelers coming this way.
DOD00000483	Well, thanks for that. It's not the first contract I've paid for to try and keep order around here, and I expect it won't be the last.
DOD00000484	Ryan O'Neill? I think I attacked the Bodean family on a contract you took out.
DOD00000485	Seriously? You completed both of my contracts? Pretty fucking crazy luck, I have to say.
DOD00000486	Well, whatever. Anyone who makes a habit of using the old roads owes you a debt of gratitude.
DOD00000487	That Norton bastard was making all the smaller outfits skittish to go past Primm. Nutjob.
DOD00000488	And those inbred freaks went out of their way to murder people traveling north of us. Can't say I'll miss them.
DOD00000489	You the Ryan O'Neill that put out some contracts with Tully Headhunting? I completed both of them.
DOD00000490	Good. That should help us keep our people fed, and maybe make a little profit, too. Thanks for that.
DOD00000491	But, as anyone unfortunate enough to sign up for this militia knows, the work never stops. I got another job for you.
DOD00000492	I'll keep it simple. A little to the south is an old motel building. It's a short walk, don't worry. I just can't leave my post, and all that.
DOD00000493	There's a woman named Luisa living in there, along with her husband, Hector. I need you to get her up and escort her over here, to me.
DOD00000494	See, Hector is a piece of shit, he likes drugs and liquor and beating the shit out of his wife, hence why I need her escorted.
DOD00000495	I recovered that shipment for you.
DOD00000496	Hector... I'm surprised he hasn't joined the Fiends. I've been this close to dragging his ass into the desert and putting a bullet in his skull.
DOD00000497	But the militia is supposed to defend Westside from outside aggression, not to execute citizens, even if the citizen in question is a loathsome cunt.
DOD00000498	Luisa is terrified of him. That's why she refuses to leave, even though we keep begging her. She thinks he'll hunt her down.
DOD00000499	I'm hoping you can convince her that, seriously, we can protect her if she'll have us, but even if not...
DOD00000500	Enough is enough. Someone saw her yesterday limping like her leg was all busted up. I'm not leaving her with that fuck any longer.
DOD00000501	Tell me about Luisa and Hector.
DOD00000502	Heh. Yes. Yes, I do want you to kill him.
DOD00000503	But, something that's been made abundantly clear to me over the years is that what I want doesn't matter. So, resist the urge to paste him.
DOD00000504	He's a fucking coward. If he tries to get in your way, stick a gun in his mouth and he'll back down.
DOD00000505	If he doesn't, and you need to self-defense him, well... Nothing of value will be lost. But, if that happens, it'd traumatize Luisa.
DOD00000506	So, as much as it pains me to say it, try not to kill the prick. If it can be helped.
DOD00000507	What if Hector tries to stop Luisa from leaving? You want me to kill him, or...?
DOD00000508	Right, off you go, then.
DOD00000509	Alright, I'm on it.
DOD00000510	God fucking dammit.
DOD00000511	Fucking hell! You know what? There's a lesson here. Fuck the benefit of the doubt. I should have put a bullet in his head years ago.
DOD00000512	But I couldn't do that, no. I thought there had to be a line we couldn't cross. We couldn't be a vigilante execution squad. So I didn't kill him.
DOD00000513	You see what I have to deal with? I'm defending the citizens here, but I fail to defend half of them, and I want to personally execute the rest.
DOD00000514	Hector killed her before I got there. He's dead now, too.
DOD00000515	Fuck me, wouldn't that be nice?
DOD00000516	So... are we done?
DOD00000517	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, maybe. All I know is two people are dead at the wrong time. One died way too soon, the other should have died years ago.
DOD00000518	Anyway. There's more shit that needs to be done. Of course. It never ends.
DOD00000519	This was two people, not the entire town. You didn't do anything wrong.
DOD00000520	[FAILED] ...Because I could have killed him a while ago, thus preventing him from killing her today.
DOD00000521	Whatever. She's dead, he's dead, soon enough, we'll all be dead. In the meanwhile, there's more work to be done.
DOD00000522	You didn't kill her, how is it your fault?
DOD00000523	More bullshit that probably won't make much difference, well intentioned as it might be.
DOD00000524	So, what's next, then?
DOD00000525	I need you to deliver a package to a ghoul named Cliff. He should be hanging out behind the old House tools building.
DOD00000526	Might be a few Fiends in the area, but it shouldn't be too much effort. Here, please don't lose it.
DOD00000527	Alright, so what's the job, then?
DOD00000528	What about?
DOD00000529	I have a few questions.
DOD00000530	My "story"? Don't think I have a story, and if I do, it'd be a boring, shitty one.
DOD00000531	Abbreviated version is that, once, there was an irrationally angry man living in the Mojave. One day, he got married and moved to Westside.
DOD00000532	Once they settled in, they had... entirely too many children. Fast forward 30-odd years later, and here I stand.
DOD00000533	What's your story?
DOD00000534	Yeah, a ludicrous number of them. Some of us even lived to adulthood. Imagine that.
DOD00000535	Most of 'em are off the reservation. I know my oldest sister is living in the NCR, as a teacher or something.
DOD00000536	My very-slightly-older brother Gerry is still in Westside. Probably passed out in some alleyway, in a puddle of his own making.
DOD00000537	And I'm pretty sure my baby brother Danny is somewhere in the Mojave, chasing his dream of being a dumbshit outlaw thug.
DOD00000538	We're all very proud of him.
DOD00000539	You have siblings?
DOD00000540	Nothing, 'cause I don't have nothing to do.
DOD00000541	What are you doing back here?
DOD00000542	Don't want to get murdered by Fiends, so I wear a stupid hat that makes them think we're buddies.
DOD00000543	Fiends are dumb like that. Probably on account of all the drugs.
DOD00000544	What's with the Fiend helmet?
DOD00000545	I sell him surplus weapons in bulk. Shit guns, understand? NCR, Gun Runners, these rusty pieces of trash would make their eyelids twitch.
DOD00000546	What's your business with O'Neill?
DOD00000547	Ah, good, yes. Tell him that I'll send a full crate over by the end of the week. Good doing business.
DOD00000548	I have a package for you from Ryan O'Neill.
DOD00000549	No. I sell in bulk. I'm not cracking one of the crates open so I can sell you a 50-cap shotgun held together with twine and happy thoughts.
DOD00000550	Can I buy any weapons from you?
DOD00000551	Source is that I found them all years ago. Eventually I'll run out, and then I'll move somewhere that isn't inclined to kill me.
DOD00000552	Where did you get all these guns?
DOD00000553	Payment. Cliff has a shitload of ancient, terrible guns that he sells in bulk for dirt cheap.
DOD00000554	They're borderline useless, but I'm trying to keep everyone armed, and I sell the extras for spare parts.
DOD00000555	What's this package?
DOD00000556	Good. I'd hate to have to rely on these ancient pieces of garbage, but if the Fiends ever attacked us in force, they might make a difference.
DOD00000557	Well, thanks for that. Takes some of the load off my shoulders. A bit.
DOD00000558	That's about all the work I can delegate to you. The remaining shit kinda has to fall on me or one of the other townies. You know how it is.
DOD00000559	Although, there is one small thing you could still do for me. It's more of a personal matter, sort of. You willing to help me with one last thing?
DOD00000560	I delivered that package.
DOD00000561	Great. So, when I say this is a personal matter, I mean it's a family thing. I'd like you to check in with my niece.
DOD00000562	She's my brother Gerry's daughter. Gerry... he's not really doing well. His son was killed a while back, and his wife left him for another man.
DOD00000563	The bitch wasn't interested in caring for her remaining child, so she left the kid with Gerry. And Gerry, he hit the bottle. Hard.
DOD00000564	A lot of us felt he wasn't fit to take care of his kid in this state. Rather than try to shape up, he sent her to some religious institution.
DOD00000565	Maybe my drunk-ass brother doesn't care much for family, but I do, damn it. I need you to check in on Jessie, see if she's alright.
DOD00000566	As for this religious center, I don't know where it is. You'll have to speak with Gerry. He should be somewhere in town, shitfaced and angry.
DOD00000567	If I tried talking to him, he'd spit on my shoes. We don't really get along much these days.
DOD00000568	Thanks again.
DOD00000569	Sure, I'll help.
DOD00000570	I understand. You've helped enough, as is. Now, if there's nothing else, I need to keep watch for Fiends.
DOD00000571	No, I think I'm done.
DOD00000572	This content is just like a depressed teenager's wrists: cut.
DOD00000573	Oh, you talk to Ryan, did you?
DOD00000574	Why don't you go back to him, okay, and tell him to stay the fuck out of my fucking business. I need my fucking baby brother looking after my shit?
DOD00000575	Fuck Ryan, and fuck you, fucker. He- he fucking told me, I wasn't being a good dad, couldn't take care of Jessie like that was fucking news.
DOD00000576	Motherfucker, I watch my first kid get shot to shit by Fiend cocksuckers, and Ryan thinks I'm not aware that I'm a shit parent?
DOD00000577	I told him, I said "motherfucker, if you care so goddamn much about her, you fucking take her." Oh no, can't do that, he doesn't have room. Whatever.
DOD00000578	And her filthy lying cunt of a mother, she won't do shit. She's too busy getting fucked by fat rich NCR bitches. Can't be bothered to help her kid.
DOD00000579	Last time I saw Jess, was that church building outside that Aerotech refugee park. Let God take care of her, since I'm too fucking inept.
DOD00000580	So? The fuck you waiting for? Go look after my fucking daughter on the behalf of my sanctimonious shithead baby brother.
DOD00000581	Ryan wanted me to check up on your daughter. Know where I could find her?
DOD00000582	Right. If you need me, I'll just be here. Probably lying in the gutter.
DOD00000583	Okay, I'm out of here.
DOD00000584	Pfft, most of my nerves are dead anyways. I barely feel pain anymore, and when I do, I drink it all away.
DOD00000585	Here, I'll let you in on a little secret, psycho-killer. See, I'm a belligerent fucking asshole because I want to set people off.
DOD00000586	I'm too much of a pussy to jump off a roof, so if some thin-skinned little bitch takes offense at me and shoots me in the face, thank god, I win.
DOD00000587	Now, kindly fuck off and leave me to my misery.
DOD00000588	You can lose the attitude, or you can lose pieces of your own body, one after the other.
DOD00000589	No you're not, you're trying to help little Ryan in his meaningless quest to convince himself that life isn't complete shit.
DOD00000590	You want to fucking help me? How about a truckload of whiskey, a loaded .45, and Sheila's head on a fucking spike. Can't manage that? Then fuck off.
DOD00000591	You don't need to be so unpleasant. I'm trying to help you.
DOD00000592	You know what, I don't really need to go into how I feel about their politics, or their goals, any of that shit. I can simplify it way down.
DOD00000593	One of the most guilt-free aspects of my job is giving summary executions to rapists. Legion is an army of rapists. Case closed.
DOD00000594	What's your opinion on the Legion?
DOD00000595	I don't hate them with a burning passion like a lot of folks around here, but that's about it.
DOD00000596	They aren't interested in doing anything to help the people here, so I've got no use for them.
DOD00000597	If they wiped out the Fiends, made sure everyone had enough food and water, gave us a fair say in their democracy, then I could live with them.
DOD00000598	How do you feel about the NCR?
DOD00000599	That's actually an unusual request, if you don't mind my saying.
DOD00000600	The vast majority of our wards come to us with no families, or they've been abandoned.
DOD00000601	Fortunately, we keep records for all of our current personnel. I can have one of our clerical workers assist you.
DOD00000602	Our archives can be found through the door to my right. Can I help you with anything else?
DOD00000603	I'm looking for a girl named Jessie O'Neill. Her uncle wants to know how she is.
DOD00000604	Path of Light isn't just a religious organization. We teach our people English, history, medicine, mathematics, and other fundamentals.
DOD00000605	With the proper time and funding, we hope to become a viable alternative to the more secular educations provided by the Followers or the OSI.
DOD00000606	This library seems a bit large for a church, isn't it?
DOD00000607	Ah, yes. Give me one moment... Jessie O'Neill...
DOD00000608	Here we are. Jessie O'Neill, 11 years old, originally from Westside, enrolled in our ministry program five months ago...
DOD00000609	Her grades are rather decent, no disciplinary record to speak of. She seems to be doing rather well.
DOD00000610	I'm looking for information regarding one of your orphans, Jessie O'Neill.
DOD00000611	Ah, no.
DOD00000612	Firstly, in order for a non-family individual, such as yourself, to meet with one of our students, we would need a written consent form.
DOD00000613	More to the point, she isn't actually here at the moment. She is currently attending a trip to Shady Sands with nine other students.
DOD00000614	The trip is being supervised by Deacon Paulson. They are expected to return in... Let me see... Six months time.
DOD00000615	Before you ask, I'm not at liberty to tell you where, exactly, you could find them. You'll just have to wait for them to return.
DOD00000616	I apologize for the inconvenience. Have a pleasant day.
DOD00000617	Can I speak with her?
DOD00000618	An individual with the NCR. It's much more important than whatever you're doing now, I assure you.
DOD00000619	Have a pleasant day.
DOD00000620	Who is it from?
DOD00000621	You're welcome. Have a pleasant day.
DOD00000622	Thank you.
DOD00000623	[SUCCEEDED] Very observant of you. Good job.
DOD00000624	Perhaps there's a common thread between the messages I have for you. Could be.
DOD00000625	You seem like an intelligent person. I'm sure you can piece things together, if you're so inclined.
DOD00000626	Well, I've got places to be. Perhaps we'll see each other again some time. Have a pleasant day.
DOD00000627	Wait a second, I've seen you before... You gave me a message in New Rockwell, didn't you?
DOD00000628	[FAILED] Evidently not.
DOD00000629	Have a pleasant day.
DOD00000630	Wait... Do I know you?
DOD00000631	Did I fuck up my leg? Why would I do something like that, insurance fraud?
DOD00000632	No, I got real drunk a couple weeks back, and eventually I found myself chucking an empty bottle at some douchebag's head.
DOD00000633	Got him pretty good, too. But his pussy-ass friends kicked the shit out of me. One of them made a point of boot-heeling my kneecap in. Cunt.
DOD00000634	Sorry, did you do something to your leg?
DOD00000635	Of course, one moment.
DOD00000636	Let's see here... Ah, yes, here we go. She was an orphan from North Vegas Square when she came to us.
DOD00000637	If you're looking for her, try there. I'm afraid I don't have any current information.
DOD00000638	I need to find a former intern of yours, named Raya.
DOD00000639	You know, "services" services. I also got a line on painkillers, if that's more to your taste.
DOD00000640	Barbiturate painkillers, not booze or trippy stuff, sad as I am to admit it.
DOD00000641	What kind of services do you offer?
DOD00000642	150 caps for a romp on my 200-year-old mattress, because I'm a classy date.
DOD00000643	How much for your time?
DOD00000644	How romantic.
DOD00000645	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
DOD00000646	Of course, how could anyone resist the allure of this shitty alleyway?
DOD00000647	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
DOD00000648	Uh-huh. Don't you worry about me faking it, now. My total lack of enthusiasm is as genuine as it gets.
DOD00000649	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
DOD00000650	You're my favorite customer.
DOD00000651	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
DOD00000652	All my shit has legitimate medical purposes, so really I'm helping the community. Ha.
DOD00000653	Let me see what you have for sale.
DOD00000654	Nothing too interesting. Once upon a time, I used to dream of making something of my life. Very optimistic and inspiring.
DOD00000655	I dreamt of joining the Followers, being a doctor. Then I discovered magical substances that made life seem to suck less, so that became my passion.
DOD00000656	What's your story?
DOD00000657	Yeah, I didn't think you were one of Dalton's, really. You look like you know what soap is, for a start.
DOD00000658	Uh... O'Neill... He's the guy from Westside, I think? The one my sister drools over?
DOD00000659	Maybe you should go talk to her. I won't shoot you when you go through the gate, promise.
DOD00000660	Whoever Dalton is, I'm not affiliated with him. Ryan O'Neill sent me.
DOD00000661	Well, you aren't supposed to be on our property, we just paid you. If you don't follow the deal, I could just shoot you.
DOD00000662	...But I don't think you actually are one of them, though. So, uh... I'm right? If I'm not, I'll have to shoot you.
DOD00000663	[LIE] Oh yeah, me and Dalton go way back. Good times.
DOD00000664	Oh, really? Great, I didn't think you'd agree. Alrighty, now I'll just need to get her to agree...
DOD00000665	Uh, I might need to get some blackmail material, first. Uh, gimme some time, I'll get back to you about it.
DOD00000666	Sure, let's do it.
DOD00000667	Oh. Well, that's lame.
DOD00000668	Well, if you ever decide to, like, start an affair or something... My sister is right here. Just saying.
DOD00000669	I'm already spoken for, so... No.
DOD00000670	Yeah, I mean, she's not that great or nothing.
DOD00000671	Well, you could marry me instead! But, uh, might need to wait a couple years. I can be patient, you just, uh, keep the offer in mind.
DOD00000672	Uh... No, thank you.
DOD00000673	She doesn't need to like it, she just needs to go along with it or I'll release her terrible secrets to the public.
DOD00000674	Just, uh... Give me some time to actually find her terrible secrets. Might take a while. I'll get back to you.
DOD00000675	I don't get the sense that she'd be down for marrying another woman.
DOD00000676	Come on, she isn't that ugly. Ugh, guys are weird. Just keep it in mind, okay?
DOD00000677	Yeah... She's not really my type.
DOD00000678	I suppose. Interpret it as you want. I just don't have much to say.
DOD00000679	We only have so much time on earth. Less than we usually expect. I'd prefer not to waste it on idle chatter.
DOD00000680	You don't really talk very much, do you?
DOD00000681	I'd prefer they don't take power, if for no other reason than my hunch that they'd take objection to everything I represent.
DOD00000682	Despite my sex, my only talents are killing. As if that weren't enough, I'm not even biologically capable of bearing children.
DOD00000683	If someone in the Legion wanted to purchase my services, fine. I don't pick and choose my clientele based on their personal ideology.
DOD00000684	But, I suspect that wouldn't happen. If nothing else, the Legion seems quite firm in their beliefs. Less likely to bend their own rules.
DOD00000685	Their loss. I suppose they'll just have to keep relying on their own assassins, shoddy and ineffectual as they may be.
DOD00000686	What's your opinion on the Legion?
DOD00000687	For a group espousing law and order and justice for all, my initial thoughts were that they would feel obligated to try and kill or detain me.
DOD00000688	But I've found numerous clients among their population. Especially the upper echelons of their class hierarchy.
DOD00000689	The more a man espouses the importance of democracy and fair play, the more likely he is to hire me if he finds himself losing, I've found.
DOD00000690	Though, that's not what you asked. My feelings on the Republic as a whole are quite similar to my feelings on everything else in life.
DOD00000691	That is to say, I feel nothing.
DOD00000692	How do you feel about the NCR?
DOD00000693	I don't feel anything about House. Not to imply I'm inundated with feelings for anything else, of course.
DOD00000694	I have no stake in his armistice with the NCR, nor do I care how he manages the New Vegas city-state. That's his business. Literally, and otherwise.
DOD00000695	I can tell you that he seems like the sort of individual who could use the services of a skilled assassin, at least.
DOD00000696	Pass along one of my business cards next time you meet him, would you?
DOD00000697	How do you feel about Mr. House?
DOD00000698	He's dead. I don't bother forming opinions on corpses. If I did, I'd be too busy to do my job. Only so many hours in the day, you know.
DOD00000699	What's your opinion on Mr. House?
DOD00000700	I would approve. And I'd also recommend you hire someone skilled, that can neutralize threats before they cause any trouble.
DOD00000701	I assure you, the leader of a commerce-centric independent city-state would be able to afford to keep me on retainer.
DOD00000702	What do you think about me securing independence for the Mojave?
DOD00000703	An independent city-state with a strong economy sounds like the ideal setting for a skilled assassin to do business, so I would approve.
DOD00000704	Moreover, securing that independence would put a target on your back. My contract to keep you alive ends after the battle of Hoover Dam, but...
DOD00000705	Well, I would prefer you don't come to any harm. If you plan on ousting the NCR and the Legion, a great many people will want your head on a pike.
DOD00000706	I think you'd find yourself in need of my services. I'm sure we could work out a favorable deal.
DOD00000707	What do you think about me securing independence for the Mojave?
DOD00000708	Pulse grenade to lock up their armor, and then a blade through the neck-seam under their helmet. Kevlar is useless against blades.
DOD00000709	Were you asking how I feel about their methods or philosophies? It seems pointless, to me.
DOD00000710	Perhaps if I saw inside their secret little headquarters, I would formulate something resembling an actual opinion. Or perhaps not.
DOD00000711	What do you think about the Brotherhood of Steel?
DOD00000712	I'm not a particularly opinionated person, but I'll answer as I can.
DOD00000713	I'd like your opinion on some of the regional factions.
DOD00000714	I generally don't "feel" much of anything. The Fiends aren't an exception.
DOD00000715	They don't hire me, and nobody else hires me to kill them. Fiend-hunting is good publicity for headhunters and bounty-killers.
DOD00000716	For killers that operate in the shadows, they're not worth the paltry bounties that army personnel and grieving families can offer up.
DOD00000717	How do you feel about the Fiends?
DOD00000718	Worthless. There can be good money in performing jobs for criminal gangs... Or for decapitating criminal gangs.
DOD00000719	But the Powder Gangers don't have the money to hire assassins, and they're too vulnerable for anyone to bother contracting me.
DOD00000720	What do you think about the Powder Gangers?
DOD00000721	I've done a job or two for the Khans. Their feud with the NCR is a matter of blood, and so hiring outside assassins is too impersonal.
DOD00000722	But if it's a matter of maintaining their stranglehold on the drug market, oh yes, they're quite willing to employ any means available.
DOD00000723	As for actual opinions... Their war with the NCR is folly. It doesn't matter how tough they are, they don't have the numbers to win.
DOD00000724	The Brotherhood already learned that lesson, to their sorrow. And I can say from experience, members of the Brotherhood are harder to kill.
DOD00000725	If they truly wish to establish their own Khanate, they should evacuate the Mojave in short order.
DOD00000726	Any thoughts on the Great Khans?
DOD00000727	As you say.
DOD00000728	That's enough, let's go.
DOD00000729	...I doubt that. It's not an especially short tale, and I find that it tends to make people uncomfortable.
DOD00000730	The short version is that I was born a slave, became a toy for raiders, a spectacle in their arena, and then a trainee assassin.
DOD00000731	If, for some reason, you want to hear more, ask.
DOD00000732	I'd like to know your backstory.
DOD00000733	Truly? I can't see what the appeal would be, but very well.
DOD00000734	I'd like to talk about your history some more.
DOD00000735	An exaggeration, perhaps. In truth, I had a month or so of freedom between my birth and my enslavement.
DOD00000736	My... parents. They didn't want a child. They sold me off to a roving slave-trader as soon as they could find one. I don't know what I was worth.
DOD00000737	It was my owner that named me, taught me to walk and speak, read and write. But most of all, he taught me to be quiet and obedient.
DOD00000738	If I hesitated, I was flogged. If I disobeyed, I was whipped. And if I failed a task, I was locked in a very small crate for... Some time.
DOD00000739	The only thing he never did to me was harming my resale value. I had to look my best. He wouldn't cripple me or... despoil me.
DOD00000740	I was a quick study. His other slaves were born free. He had to break them down and remake them in the image he desired.
DOD00000741	But I was raised, from birth, to be property. I didn't know any other way, so resistance never crossed my mind.
DOD00000742	Eventually, when I was quite young, he passed through a raider settlement, and I was sold to their leader. I never saw my original master again.
DOD00000743	You were born a slave?
DOD00000744	...Yes.
DOD00000745	The gang leader... Had certain predilections. He found me appealing.
DOD00000746	When I wasn't being used for his pleasure, he also found amusement in torturing me. I... used to pray that if I did a good job, he wouldn't hurt me.
DOD00000747	He always found reason to harm me, regardless. Looking back, I recognize sadism is it's own reward for those who possess it. Torture amused him.
DOD00000748	Eventually, he tired of me. I was tossed to the rest of his gang to do with as they saw fit.
DOD00000749	When I was lucky, they had me do domestic work. When I was unlucky, it was more of what I suffered under their leader. I was often unlucky.
DOD00000750	This was a large gang. A settlement, really. One of their favorite pastimes was forcing slaves to fight to the death in an arena.
DOD00000751	Children weren't exempt. Rather, they were the favorite fighters. Eventually, my captors tired of using me, and threw me to the arena.
DOD00000752	You were purchased by raiders?
DOD00000753	Fine. The raiders loved to watch their slaves and captives fight to the death, and children were their favorite. The... wrongness entertained them.
DOD00000754	The one downside for the raiders was that most people have an innate resistance to killing. Children more than most.
DOD00000755	The children would spend most of the "fights" cowering and crying, begging for freedom and forgiveness, refusing to arm themselves.
DOD00000756	But I... Was taught, from birth, to be obedient. I must do whatever my owner commanded, without a flicker of hesitation.
DOD00000757	When they placed me in the arena and told me to kill, that's what I did. While the others cried and begged, I took up the knife and killed them all.
DOD00000758	One by one, they fell. I didn't hesitate. That would have been unthinkable. The raiders were... Stunned. By me. What I had done for them.
DOD00000759	Watching a little girl cut down her fellows in cold blood amused the raiders more than they could say. And they... rewarded me.
DOD00000760	No more beatings, no more rape, no more domestic servitude. Instead, they praised me for putting on a good show. And they gave me drugs.
DOD00000761	When I killed for them, not only did the pain finally stop, but the drugs gave me a sense of euphoria I had never known. It was almost... Happiness.
DOD00000762	I haven't touched any chems for a long time, but there's some lingering neurological damage. And psychological, of course.
DOD00000763	Tell me more about this arena you fought in.
DOD00000764	I warned you.
DOD00000765	I'm... not really comfortable talking about this anymore.
DOD00000766	It ended in blood, as it began. As with everything else in my life, freedom was forced upon me. I never chose to escape.
DOD00000767	As large and cruel as the raider gang was, they made enemies. One of these enemies hired an assassin to end the threat, once and for all.
DOD00000768	There was no grand battle. One morning, I woke in my cell to the sounds of gunfire and yelling, then... Silence.
DOD00000769	Some minutes later, a stranger strolled into the holding cages. He looked at all of us chattel, and then he unlocked our cells. Told us we were free.
DOD00000770	The other children... They despised me almost as much as they feared me. They had seen me as I killed every slave that was sent against me.
DOD00000771	They watched the raiders praise me for killing their friends and family. In their eyes, I was the embodiment of all they had suffered.
DOD00000772	When they were given their freedom, they decided to tie up the last loose end. Maybe they thought I wouldn't fight with no raiders directing me.
DOD00000773	But I did. Instead of enjoying their newfound freedom, they all died at my hands. The assassin watched it all, never interfering.
DOD00000774	When it was over, he told me that, if I wanted, I could come with him. That he would teach me how to use my talents properly.
DOD00000775	What could I do but accept? I knew nothing of freedom. I would have made a mess of myself.
DOD00000776	How did you escape the raiders?
DOD00000777	He died. Not at the hands of another assassin, not to a botched job, not through any violent means. He died of a lung disease.
DOD00000778	I could have thrown his body in the street, but out of respect, I buried him in the desert. And I took his blade for my own use. It serves me well.
DOD00000779	What happened to your mentor?
DOD00000780	No. The past cannot be changed. Regrets only serve as a distraction, and my mind needs to be focused to be effective.
DOD00000781	You've had a hard life. Do you have any regrets?
DOD00000782	They barely fought back.
DOD00000783	They were slaves and captures, ripped from their ordinary, happy lives. Forced into collars and told to kill or be killed.
DOD00000784	All they had was fear and hesitation. All I had was an entire life where the fear and hesitation was whipped, beaten, and starved out of me.
DOD00000785	And when killing them was the only surefire method of making my own pain end... When it actually brought me something akin to happiness...
DOD00000786	My emotions died when I was first purchased from my parents. All the same, the raiders managed to force a degree of bloodlust on me.
DOD00000787	How could you kill the other children so easily?
DOD00000788	Beyond proper medicines? I take sleeping pills for practical reasons, but otherwise, no, not since the day I was released.
DOD00000789	No doubt they're a pleasant escape for those who choose to indulge. I never had that choice. The drugs were forced on me, and it never stopped.
DOD00000790	When I was finally free of them, I had... Clarity. A fog lifted. I never want to lose that clarity again.
DOD00000791	The raiders gave you drugs. Do you still... use them?
DOD00000792	They're mediocre, deluded assassins. I don't extend the effort of actively disliking things, but I find their notion to be repellent.
DOD00000793	A proper assassin is an implement of death, nothing more. When men make the decision to kill, some use blades, others bullets, some use people.
DOD00000794	It isn't personal, and I harbor no illusions of morality. I kill for money, if you put stock into ethics, it's an inherently evil act.
DOD00000795	But bounty hunters, headhunters, whatever their name, have it backwards. It's all personal to them.
DOD00000796	Their client is an afterthought, all the focus is on the heroic bounty hunter, profiting off of death while crowing about justice.
DOD00000797	They're a flashy tool, used to make a point about the reach and the righteousness of their clientele.
DOD00000798	You don't seem to like bounty hunters much. Why?
DOD00000799	I'm aware. Of your many apparent professions, you'll forgive me if there's at least one that I almost care enough to dislike.
DOD00000800	Fortunately, I don't really feel much about anything. If it makes you feel better, no doubt you could find some distasteful aspect of me, as well.
DOD00000801	Probably involving dead children. That one never fails to offend someone.
DOD00000802	You know I've done my share of bounty hunting, yes?
DOD00000803	Are you implying you do headhunting work for free? I doubt that.
DOD00000804	I may not be well versed into the nuances of what is or is not just, but I'm confident that murder-for-hire doesn't qualify, no matter the target.
DOD00000805	Even if your target deserves to die, accepting a contract on his life is inherently impersonal; not righteous punishment.
DOD00000806	If anyone in that equation is morally upstanding, it would be your client. Lacking the ability to kill, he contracts you.
DOD00000807	As I said, the dividing line between my work and bounty work is that what I do, I do in the shadows. And, I know exactly what I am.
DOD00000808	It's not about prestige, it's about meting out justice.
DOD00000809	Wise.
DOD00000810	That said, the glaring flaw is that your methods leave you with a target on your back.
DOD00000811	Consider accepting contracts anonymously. Don't engage your targets in petty banter before executing them. If you can avoid being seen, do so.
DOD00000812	I think, if you adopt my methods, you'll find yourself with far fewer attempts at violent retaliation being delivered to your door.
DOD00000813	I couldn't care less about the moral implications. I'm doing a job I was paid to do, nothing more.
DOD00000814	And I may have answers. Ask.
DOD00000815	I have some questions.
DOD00000816	For what purpose? Very well, proceed.
DOD00000817	I'd like to ask some questions.
DOD00000818	I wouldn't consider myself much of a conversationalist, but I will answer to the best of my abilities.
DOD00000819	Can I ask you something?
DOD00000820	On which topic?
DOD00000821	I'd like to ask you something.
DOD00000822	He's dead. Not at my hands, but dead all the same.
DOD00000823	He was a lieutenant in a slaver ring operated by a man named Schrader.
DOD00000824	Several years ago, Schrader's ring began to come into conflict with another group, operated by a man named Dietrich.
DOD00000825	My former master was captured in a skirmish with Dietrich, and they decided to make an example of him for Schrader's crew to witness.
DOD00000826	They flayed him alive, and nailed his skin to the door of Schrader's HQ. How unfortunate for him.
DOD00000827	Do you know what became of the slaver who bought you?
DOD00000828	You... did?
DOD00000829	I... Thank you.
DOD00000830	Eugene Schrader? I cut him down like the vermin he was.
DOD00000831	The man who had rescued me brought me with him. As he promised, he began to teach me his trade.
DOD00000832	I had experience killing and my instincts were sharp, but I lacked finesse, let alone experience with weaponry or... subtler methods.
DOD00000833	He taught me to shoot, to wield a blade, to move silently and unseen. I already knew how to read, but he gave me a real education.
DOD00000834	If I failed a task, disappointed him in some way... He would lecture me harshly, and then let me try again. He was strict, but never cruel.
DOD00000835	Soon, I was accompanying him on missions. He would offer advice and make suggestions, but for the first time, I had... autonomy. Real freedom.
DOD00000836	We weren't close, and our relationship was never anything more than professional. He simply wanted to pass on his skills and knowledge.
DOD00000837	That never bothered me. He was the first person I ever met that didn't want me to suffer.
DOD00000838	In time, I became skilled enough to accept my own contracts, without him. He had nothing left to teach me, so he stopped trying.
DOD00000839	We were just two independent murderers, living in the same building. And that's where my personal history ends.
DOD00000840	Everything between that point and us speaking right now falls into job details, which I don't discuss.
DOD00000841	So, how did you end up an assassin?
DOD00000842	Perhaps, but when a group is rushing for blood, my thoughts don't immediately turn to how I can subdue them non-lethally.
DOD00000843	And really, the thought of mercy never crossed my mind. All of my experiences taught me that life is cheap and easily thrown away.
DOD00000844	They wanted me dead; I wanted to live. Somebody is going to lose in that equation, and I wasn't going to let it be me.
DOD00000845	Couldn't you have left some of the other children alive?
DOD00000846	I... Thank you. That is... not necessary.
DOD00000847	I'm sorry you went through all of that. You deserved better.
DOD00000848	...I don't enjoy anything. I'm an emotionally-dead, hollow, empty shell of a human, whose only reason for living is to kill others for money.
DOD00000849	So... When you're not on the job, what do you enjoy? Any hobbies?
DOD00000850	I purchase ammunition, gun oil, whetstones, and medical supplies. Of course, I also keep myself fed and hydrated.
DOD00000851	O...kay then. What do you spend your assassination money on?
DOD00000852	...No. I haven't.
DOD00000853	...
DOD00000854	You're... surprisingly charitable. That's rare, especially around here. However, that's an easy trait for someone to take advantage of.
DOD00000855	Precisely what community do you believe I'm part of? I owe no loyalty to the dregs that find themselves in the slum surrounding my current safehouse.
DOD00000856	If you have more money than you need, have you considered giving back to your community?
DOD00000857	...
DOD00000858	I try to spare at least an hour every day for silent meditation, to keep myself focused.
DOD00000859	I... Also read whatever I can. Content doesn't matter. Children's books, encyclopedias, porno novels, biographies or fantasies. Whatever.
DOD00000860	It isn't enjoyment, but I do try to know as much as I can. And anything to distract me from my thoughts is welcome.
DOD00000861	Well, what do you do when you have free time between missions?
DOD00000862	...Yes.
DOD00000863	I... listen to music. Not the dated nonsense on the radio, of course. Music... It was never ruined for me. Not like everything else.
DOD00000864	It makes me feel calm. It can almost evoke... feelings. Positive ones. I... value that, more than I can say.
DOD00000865	And, uh... I kind of like flowers. They're pretty.
DOD00000866	Now we're getting somewhere. Do you do anything that serves no practical purpose?
DOD00000867	...How do you figure that?
DOD00000868	See, I knew there was more depth to you than you let on.
DOD00000869	If... You say so.
DOD00000870	...Thank you.
DOD00000871	An emotionally-dead, murderous, empty person wouldn't enjoy music and flowers. You're only human.
DOD00000872	Right... I'm at your back.
DOD00000873	You're too hard on yourself. Now, come on, let's get moving.
DOD00000874	...Nobody has ever thought that before.
DOD00000875	You're clearly insane. I suppose I'm obligated to keep you from getting hurt, then. Very well. I've got your back.
DOD00000876	I do say so. And we're friends, so that makes me qualified to say so.
DOD00000877	If you insist.
DOD00000878	I'd like to talk about you, Charlie.
DOD00000879	I don't know. I don't even know if my parents survived. Perhaps they died screaming, shortly after selling me.
DOD00000880	It's entirely possible that I have siblings, aunts or uncles, cousins... Or, perhaps not.
DOD00000881	It doesn't matter. If I do have family, I don't want to meet them. Shared DNA is a poor excuse for forcing companionship.
DOD00000882	I see no reason to believe that any hypothetical surviving family would be more inclined to care for me than the family I did know.
DOD00000883	So, do you have any family besides your parents?
DOD00000884	If that roving slave-trader hadn't come along, I suppose I would have simply starved to death. My parents clearly didn't want me around.
DOD00000885	Supposing that they did actually love me and raise me... Who knows? Maybe I'd be a singer, or a philanthropist. I could have been an author.
DOD00000886	I would... Probably be happy. I wouldn't be such a broken wreck of a person. I wouldn't kill people for money, and feel nothing as I watch them die.
DOD00000887	I... would prefer to speak about something else.
DOD00000888	If you had never been enslaved, how do you think your life would have turned out?
DOD00000889	I don't talk about completed contracts. I'm paid for silence, not just killing.
DOD00000890	So, any interesting stories from your assassination work?
DOD00000891	No, I've never catastrophically failed a job. Even if I did, I still don't talk about previous contracts, as I've said.
DOD00000892	Any assassin worth the title doesn't "accidentally" kill anyone. They kill who they mean to kill. No more, no less. I'm much the same.
DOD00000893	As for innocents, if you even believe in the concept, it isn't my place to make ethical judgements on my targets.
DOD00000894	But, I've certainly killed my fair share of people that common society would deem innocent and worthy of protection.
DOD00000895	You know that cliche about the tortured assassin with a heart of gold, with strict rules of honor, never killing women or children?
DOD00000896	That isn't me. I've killed women, children, the unarmed and the defenseless. A target is a target. I don't care about the rest.
DOD00000897	And no, I've never felt one iota of guilt for any of it. I don't really feel anything at all, in any context. I'm rather cold-blooded.
DOD00000898	Well, any botched jobs? Something go wrong in a humorous way? Accidentally shot an innocent?
DOD00000899	I think... That paranoia is wise. If you spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, you're less likely to take a knife in the spine.
DOD00000900	But, unless you intend to turn on me, you have nothing to fear in that regard.
DOD00000901	I don't accept contracts on people that I know in any capacity. Even more important is that I'm already under contract to keep you alive.
DOD00000902	...Of course, I would say the same thing if I really were plotting to kill you when you least expect it. I suppose you'll never know.
DOD00000903	You know, I've made a lot of enemies... I don't suppose you'd ever try to assassinate me for them?
DOD00000904	Of course I've fucking never been in a relationship. You'll forgive my saying so, but what an absurd question.
DOD00000905	Look at me. I'm an emotionally dead killer. I've been called a "soulless husk of a human", which seems apt enough.
DOD00000906	Even if someone were so insane as to desire me, do you truly believe I could reciprocate?
DOD00000907	I don't have feelings, or empathy, or warmth. I'm not even capable of feeling the most basic physical pleasures that come with relationships.
DOD00000908	I don't even have platonic friends. I'm not like you. When I die, I'll die alone and unmourned.
DOD00000909	...Cherish what you have. It's more than you know.
DOD00000910	Have you ever had any kind of romantic relationship in your life?
DOD00000911	I'm... I apologize. That was cruel of me.
DOD00000912	I... Value you, and your companionship. I've never had anything to compare it with. You'll forgive me if I stumble over my words, sometimes.
DOD00000913	I meant no offense. I can say no more than that.
DOD00000914	What do you mean you don't have friends? What about me?
DOD00000915	Thank you. I'll make it up to you by killing anyone who actually tries to cause you harm. Surely that's fair?
DOD00000916	Well, lead on. I'll follow you as long as you'll have me.
DOD00000917	No harm done, Charlie.
DOD00000918	Don't be absurd. Why would you have any interest in me, like that?
DOD00000919	I'm very sure I just explained how I'm incapable of affection. There are thousands that would be more suitable for your... feelings.
DOD00000920	No doubt you would be happier pursuing somebody that isn't fundamentally broken, inside and out.
DOD00000921	Well, maybe we could be more than just friends, huh?
DOD00000922	Don't be absurd. Why would you have any interest in me, like that?
DOD00000923	I'm very sure I just explained how I'm incapable of affection. There are thousands that would be more suitable for your... feelings.
DOD00000924	No doubt you would be happier pursuing somebody that isn't fundamentally broken, inside and out.
DOD00000925	Well, maybe we could be more than just friends, huh?
DOD00000926	When you say "men", do you specifically mean adult males, or just mankind in general? Because the latter number is far higher.
DOD00000927	As for specific numbers... I have no idea. Likely triple digits either way. I'm quite good at what I do, and my prices are very reasonable.
DOD00000928	Killing is my profession. I suppose I'm just not interested in making a sport of it, keeping track of numbers and personal records.
DOD00000929	How many men have you killed?
DOD00000930	Ready for an anticlimax?
DOD00000931	I purchased it. At an exorbitant price.
DOD00000932	I read about their uses, and heard testament to how they were the one of the few times Vault-Tec produced something that actually worked.
DOD00000933	I decided it would be a useful tool for my work. No doubt you agree, from personal experience.
DOD00000934	Where did you get that Pip-Boy?
DOD00000935	I mean what I say. I have no feelings. My emotions are dead. I can experience some instinctual fear or frustration, but little more.
DOD00000936	Joy, rage, misery, lust... I have none of these things. It extends to physical sensations, too. I don't really feel pain or pleasure.
DOD00000937	Perhaps it's all a result of how broken my mind is, or maybe it's actually acute nerve damage. I don't know. I don't particularly care.
DOD00000938	When you say you have no feelings, what exactly do you mean?
DOD00000939	Well, that's farcical. Besides, even if you're not technically paying my wages, I still consider you to be my client. I'm an assassin, not a hooker.
DOD00000940	That said, while your persistence over this subject is mildly obnoxious, I'm not overly bothered. I've found you relatively trustworthy, so far.
DOD00000941	Out of respect, I suppose I'd allow you to broach this topic again, once I'm no longer under contract to you. If you actually care that much.
DOD00000942	In the meantime, I have a very clear job to do, and you have... Whatever it is that motivates you. Let's get back to work, yes?
DOD00000943	Come on, you're really not willing to give me a chance?
DOD00000944	You didn't offend me. I'm not even capable of feeling offense, you know.
DOD00000945	I suppose it's actually almost flattering that you would even consider me for such a thing.
DOD00000946	Rest assured, the issue here is my wealth of emotional and psychological problems.
DOD00000947	I've no doubt you'll find someone capable of returning your affections, some day. But for now, let's just get back to business, yes?
DOD00000948	Alright, I didn't mean to offend you. I won't bring it up again.
DOD00000949	Very well.
DOD00000950	That's enough talk for now.
DOD00000951	Met many men named Charlotte, have you?
DOD00000952	No offense, but isn't Charlie a guy's name?
DOD00000953	Fine. I've already been paid, so I don't care one way or another. If you change your mind, it seems you know where to find me.
DOD00000954	Actually, I don't need any assistance at the moment.
DOD00000955	If that's what you'd prefer.
DOD00000956	Actually, I don't need any assistance at the moment.
DOD00000957	I respect their conviction, even as I'm convinced that they're doomed to fail.
DOD00000958	Accessible medical aid and the free exchange of ideas are appealing concepts, and most Followers I've met truly believe in what they're doing.
DOD00000959	However, they're operating from a perspective that most people are inherently good, which doesn't really seem to be true, in my experience.
DOD00000960	Blithely ignoring reality, no matter how well intentioned, will eventually lead to sorrow and failure. It's only a matter of time.
DOD00000961	How do you feel about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
DOD00000962	Well, that depends on whether you believe the term actually has requirements before it can accurately apply to a person.
DOD00000963	There's no shortage of people who claim themselves to be assassins. If you take them at their word, then the Mojave is flooded with the profession.
DOD00000964	But, most of these sorts consider "assassination" to mean walking right up to their target and announcing their murderous intent. Then they die.
DOD00000965	In my eyes, they're nothing more than worthless thugs, not assassins... No matter how much they might crow otherwise.
DOD00000966	Actual professional killers, who operate covertly and professionally, are few and far between. So be it.
DOD00000967	So, how many assassins are in the Mojave, you think?
DOD00000968	Are you asking for personal reasons? I'm afraid I can't accept any contracts from you.
DOD00000969	I strongly prefer anonymity from my clients. Dead drops, encrypted communication... Couriers. It's safer for them, and for myself.
DOD00000970	But, in general, I don't have a fixed price point. It depends on the target.
DOD00000971	Some random outlaw nobody? Couple hundred caps. High-ranking military personnel? At least a thousand, likely more.
DOD00000972	President Kimball? 100,000 up front.
DOD00000973	So, how much do you charge for your services?
DOD00000974	Could I? Absolutely. Would I? ...Unlikely. The only ones I can think of with both the motive and the financial incentive would be the Legion.
DOD00000975	For a faction so enraptured by Social Darwinism, they're rather infatuated with the notion that women are incapable of murder.
DOD00000976	Their loss.
DOD00000977	You don't seriously think you could kill President Kimball, do you?
DOD00000978	...No, courier. No, I don't think I could kill a man that is already dead.
DOD00000979	You don't seriously think you could kill President Kimball, do you?
DOD00000980	You have a remarkable talent for surviving attempts on your life, and it tends to go poorly for the prospective killers.
DOD00000981	Factoring personal risk, I'd require... At least 50,000. Possibly more, depending on other factors.
DOD00000982	Next time some amateur killer fails to execute you, search their body for the death order they inevitably stuffed into their pocket...
DOD00000983	More likely than not, the payout being offered is laughably small. As if you needed further proof of how worthless an assassin they are.
DOD00000984	So, hypothetically, how much would you charge to kill me?
DOD00000985	I'm excellent at killing people. The entity that hired me wants me to follow you and kill anyone who would wish to do you harm.
DOD00000986	None of your enemies scare me, and I'm being paid a very agreeable amount, enough to retain my services over a long stretch of time.
DOD00000987	Somebody wants you alive, courier. Should you feel honored, or terrified?
DOD00000988	I don't get it. Why hire an assassin for bodyguard work?
DOD00000989	If they haven't told you themselves, I'm not going to speculate on their identity or motives.
DOD00000990	I've worked for them before, and they've been reliable, as far as clients are concerned. That's all you need to know.
DOD00000991	Nothing personal. Discretion is part of my contract.
DOD00000992	Who hired you for this?
DOD00000993	You might be surprised by just how many people want that crier boy's head on a pike.
DOD00000994	Eliza seems to be suffering the delusion that her myriad of angry opinions actually matter.
DOD00000995	If all somebody has to complain about are trivialities, it's easy to gauge what an idyllic life they've been blessed with.
DOD00000996	How do you feel about my other companions?
DOD00000997	This one drinks too much. I wouldn't rely on her any more than was necessary.
DOD00000998	How do you feel about my other companions?
DOD00000999	Medical expertise is always useful, and this one seems adept enough with energy weapons.
DOD00001000	How do you feel about my other companions?
DOD00001001	Between myself and Boone, I don't expect you'll be in much danger from would-be assassins.
DOD00001002	If he wanted into the assassination business after the war, I think he has the skills and temperament to be almost as good as I am.
DOD00001003	How do you feel about my other companions?
DOD00001004	Huh. Well, checkmate, I guess.
DOD00001005	Damn it, I was looking forward to acting like a dumbass grunt, delegating you with bitchwork.
DOD00001006	Fine, yes, you got me. This is what happens when we always have the same operative delivering messages.
DOD00001007	Name is still Morgan. Still need you to do a job for us. The cover was nothing personal, we just prefer to operate discreetly.
DOD00001008	We were going to offer you 200 bucks for your time. I'll bump that up to... Let's say 800, and additional benefits upon completion of the job. Deal?
DOD00001009	Are you with the Office of Mojave Affairs?
DOD00001010	This seems counterintuitive. I don't know that the Legion is quite as pragmatic as they declare themselves to be.
DOD00001011	Nipton collaborated with the Legion. Aided them in their trap for the NCR and the Powder Gangers. And yet... Look at their reward.
DOD00001012	If this is how the Legion repays those who assist it, why would any future towns opt for anything other than fighting to the very last man?
DOD00001013	What do you mean?
DOD00001014	Understood.
DOD00001015	Quiet, I'm not looking for conversation right now.
DOD00001016	Evidently.
DOD00001017	They simply seem like a more disciplined raider band. I grew up surrounded by raiders, and strung-up corpses were a familiar sight.
DOD00001018	I feel as though they were more honest. They did it because it amused them. They never claimed that acts of barbarism would create a better world.
DOD00001019	All the bloodshed in the world can't change human nature. I don't think Caesar is reading the right historical texts.
DOD00001020	The Legion claims to be pragmatic, but they're just sadistic killers, nothing more.
DOD00001021	...So, is the Legion being directed by a child, or...?
DOD00001022	Nipton was never NCR territory. All the Legion has managed to convey is that they're entirely unreasonable, and motivated primarily by carnage.
DOD00001023	If anything, this will simply unite people against the Legion, even if it means reluctantly allying with NCR.
DOD00001024	"The NCR may be corrupt and ineffectual, but at least they only want to tax me, which is more than I could say of the Legion."
DOD00001025	Something to that effect.
DOD00001026	It's about sending a message to the Mojave, that the NCR cannot protect them.
DOD00001027	I'm aware of the reasoning behind the slaughter.
DOD00001028	However, the crime Nipton was so guilty of was to side with the Legion. If this is how Caesar repays those who collaborate, nobody else ever will.
DOD00001029	It simply seems, to me, that if a cornered foe knows that he has no chance to escape, he will fight harder out of spite and rage.
DOD00001030	For as flashy as Caesar's methods may be, he's making his conquest more difficult than it has to be.
DOD00001031	Although, I suppose that was already evident, considering how many Legionaries aren't equipped with firearms or first aid.
DOD00001032	This was punishment for Nipton's crimes. It's justice, not butchery.
DOD00001033	Geez, that's a pretty harsh way to frame it. 100% accurate, but so harsh.
DOD00001034	Where's your sense of adventure? Come on, now!
DOD00001035	Whatever. If you know what the OMA is, you know we do some cloak-and-dagger plausible-deniability covert-ops nonsense.
DOD00001036	And yes, sometimes, that means we commit the unforgivable atrocity of fudging the truth with outside operatives. You'll get over it. Eventually.
DOD00001037	Now, will you accept this trivially easy operation, or are you going to refuse because I'm a mean person that lied about my exact occupation once?
DOD00001038	Why would I want to work for someone who just lied to me?
DOD00001039	Just gotta make a little run to a farm shack, maybe a half-hour away, tops. Pick up something, bring it on back. Easy.
DOD00001040	Not allowed to give out more details unless you accept the job, so... I'm sure you're dying of curiosity...
DOD00001041	What's the job?
DOD00001042	Well. You've completely defied my expectations of you. ...Congratulations...?
DOD00001043	Fine. Get out. Idiot.
DOD00001044	No. I'm not interested. Don't contact me again.
DOD00001045	Alright, that's perfect.
DOD00001046	You're going to be heading to one of the shacks on the Horowitz Farm. It's been co-opted by a person of interest we're investigating.
DOD00001047	He likely won't be there, so don't worry about that. Instead, worry about finding a gray, metal briefcase. We know it's stashed in there, somewhere.
DOD00001048	Get that briefcase, don't let it get shot or burned or anything silly like that, and bring it back to me.
DOD00001049	Job's simple, and then you get paid. Good luck, and all that.
DOD00001050	Fine, I'll do it.
DOD00001051	Well that's what we're going to fucking figure out, because I'm a fucking god at this shit.
DOD00001052	Some encrypted conspiracy nutjob's psychotic ramblings. Heh. "I'm so slick, the NCR will never know I'm on to them!" You lose, bitch.
DOD00001053	That fucking hack Feldstein only wishes he could work with shit this high-technical. Heh, how's your robot fuckbuddy feel now, Melvin?
DOD00001054	Wait, you're still here? Fuck off and let me work. Go talk to Morgan. Some of us actually have fucking jobs to do here.
DOD00001055	So, what exactly is in this briefcase?
DOD00001056	Pfft. Whatever. Fuck off.
DOD00001057	Well Alex, pleasant as this conversation has been, I need to report back to Morgan.
DOD00001058	Oh, well, let me address that right now. Here you go.
DOD00001059	An extra reward is that I get to let you in on a little secret. It turns out... I'm not actually in the military.
DOD00001060	No, no, this is actually an Office of Mojave Affairs operation. This briefcase runaround? Just seeing if we could rely on you.
DOD00001061	Now, don't worry yourself over this bureaucratic nonsense. Just a formality.
DOD00001062	Now, I think I may have a related job here, let me see if they've forwarded me the file...
DOD00001063	Right. I don't think you even told me how much I was being paid for this.
DOD00001064	No need to remind me. I always keep paperwork.
DOD00001065	Now, that briefcase run was just a little... Let's call it a quality assurance test. Want to make sure you're competent.
DOD00001066	I think I may have a related job here, let me see if they've forwarded me the file...
DOD00001067	800, I think you said it was?
DOD00001068	Interesting. What would bring the Khans and Fiends to blows? Perhaps the Khans tried to save the villagers? Too late, I suppose.
DOD00001069	I've heard about what happened here. Makes me feel confident in my own methodology.
DOD00001070	Nobody bothered with performing recon, gathering intel as to whether or not their targets were even present.
DOD00001071	The commanders had no grasp on the situation on the ground, and the soldiers had no idea what they ought to be doing.
DOD00001072	The NCR even failed to capitalize on it for propaganda purposes. They could have used it as a show of their strength and unfettered resolve.
DOD00001073	Instead, they meekly apologize and deflect blame. They come off as idiotic, bloodthirsty, and weak-willed. Ridiculous.
DOD00001074	I leave matters of ethics and morality to philosophers and philanthropists. I'm an assassin. I don't see much inherent value in human life.
DOD00001075	Whether or not the attack was justified is irrelevant to me. I'm simply unable to grasp how they failed so badly on so many levels.
DOD00001076	An organized military accidentally massacres a village of noncombatants. It sounds like the punchline to a joke.
DOD00001077	Whatever. Fretting over the past is a mistake. Shall we proceed?
DOD00001078	It almost sounds as if you approve of the idea behind the attack, if not the methods.
DOD00001079	I think they already have. The people of the Mojave despise them. They've made themselves out to be murderous conquerors.
DOD00001080	For a nation so fond of espousing the importance of justice and democracy, this is a stain they can never wash away.
DOD00001081	The Bitter Springs massacre was an atrocity, and the NCR has to pay for what they did.
DOD00001082	Perhaps. The enmity between the NCR and the Khans is very old. Each side has wounded the other. Fault depends on who you believe drew first blood.
DOD00001083	I don't particularly care who struck first, nor do I believe any one side is morally justifiable. I have no stake in any of this.
DOD00001084	Above all else, the infamous Bitter Springs Incident, Massacre, whatever you want to call it... It was all utterly pointless.
DOD00001085	The Khans brought this on themselves. The NCR did what was necessary.
DOD00001086	Well... It seems that my contact got himself distracted.
DOD00001087	There's this ongoing manhunt for an NCR fugitive right now. Some senator's son was getting too handsy with the kids, and fled when he got busted.
DOD00001088	It seems my contact is busy trying to monitor this fugitive situation, rather than giving me my necessary intel. Prick.
DOD00001089	Well... It seems I got nothing for you, at the moment. I suppose your choices are to wedge your thumb firmly up your ass and wait patiently...
DOD00001090	Or, if you really care, you could go and join in this manhunt and resolve shit quickly. They'd pay you, too, if that helps.
DOD00001091	Check back with me later, I suppose.
DOD00001092	Well? You have a job for me, or not?
DOD00001093	Turns out I do. Good. Here's a dossier on this guy. You can read it or not.
DOD00001094	Now, Blake, the lunatic who had that briefcase you retrieved, is almost certainly in correspondence with this guy in the dossier, here.
DOD00001095	Well? You have a job for me, or not?
DOD00001096	Turns out I do. Good. Here's a dossier on this guy. You can read it or not.
DOD00001097	Now, Blake, the lunatic who had that briefcase you retrieved, is almost certainly in correspondence with this guy in the dossier, here.
DOD00001098	Well? You have a job for me, or not?
DOD00001099	Oh, that tantalizing, was it?
DOD00001100	Well, maybe once you complete this monumental task that I've assigned you, we can discuss it further.
DOD00001101	Go on, now. There's a sweaty hacker that is desperately crying out for this briefcase.
DOD00001102	Hold on, I need to know what was going on in that shack where I found the briefcase.
DOD00001103	Yep.
DOD00001104	Alright, I'm going.
DOD00001105	Ah. That was the temporary safehouse of the enigmatic Mr. Blake.
DOD00001106	Blake is some paranoid anarchist nutjob. He does it all. Crazy manifestos, pirate radio stations, encrypted communications... All of it.
DOD00001107	He's mostly obsessed with the evil secret agendas of the NCR government, but he's more than happy to theorize about House and/or Caesar, too.
DOD00001108	"Why would you care about this, hmm?" I hear you asking.
DOD00001109	For one, this dick keeps trying to incite his lunatic followers to harass NCR personnel and damage or steal our property.
DOD00001110	Worse, he's actually managed to, on occasion, worm his way into something classified, whereupon he gleefully exposes it to the world at large.
DOD00001111	We're trying to win a war here. We don't have the time to deal with petty sabotage and intelligence leaks from this paranoid asshole.
DOD00001112	Okay, I need to know what was up with that shack where I found your briefcase.
DOD00001113	Encrypted hard drives. That originally belonged to us. Well, not "us" as in the OMA, but "us" as in the NCR as a whole.
DOD00001114	No doubt he already cracked them and backed-up all of the classified intel. We're just analyzing it to see if he left anything behind.
DOD00001115	At this point, we've just accepted that he has bolt-holes and escape plans for every possible scenario.
DOD00001116	Catching him is nigh on impossible, but if we startle him, we can usually get our hands on whatever he left behind. Little bastard.
DOD00001117	Oh well. Eventually he'll slip up, and that will be the end of that. He wants to speculate about government black sites? That's where he'll be kept.
DOD00001118	So, what was in that briefcase, anyway?
DOD00001119	That's classified. I love that response, it never gets old.
DOD00001120	What can you tell me about the Office of Mojave Affairs?
DOD00001121	I'm aware you've worked with us in the past, but the name of your contact means nothing to me.
DOD00001122	We operate in compartmentalized cells, under false identities. It could be that I've worked alongside your Sawyer at some point. No idea, really.
DOD00001123	Our intelligence is centralized, but we've ensured that one cell cannot compromise any others, under any circumstances.
DOD00001124	I worked with an OMA operative named Sawyer. You know him?
DOD00001125	Ah, yes. Alex. What a repulsive man, isn't he?
DOD00001126	He's a savant with encryptions, and a complete ass in every other respect.
DOD00001127	Like yourself, he's an independent contractor. Unlike you, Alex is worthless in the field. He's here for one job, then we cut him loose.
DOD00001128	If he were a trifle less arrogant, perhaps he could have made something of himself. Oh well.
DOD00001129	What's up with Alex?
DOD00001130	That's the name. Supposedly.
DOD00001131	Hurst worked in close proximity to some government officials, about a decade ago. Seems he may have been collecting some privileged information.
DOD00001132	I won't bore you with the classified specifics, but Hurst is implicated in selling some intelligence to Blake, our briefcase thief.
DOD00001133	Hurst is holed up in Red Rock Canyon, we believe. Shacked up with some Great Khan friends of his.
DOD00001134	We need a third party, you, to make contact with Hurst. Do whatever you need to do to squeeze Blake's location from him.
DOD00001135	Oh, yes, on a different note, here's something you may be interested in. I hired an assassin for you.
DOD00001136	Eddie Hurst. Who is this?
DOD00001137	Did I get you going?
DOD00001138	Yes, I've contracted an assassin, a rather skilled one, to back you up, if you deem it necessary.
DOD00001139	You're quite an asset to the Office. It wouldn't do for you to fall prey to angry raiders or Legion retribution squads.
DOD00001140	This assassin said that you could contact them in Freeside. It's near that water pump; I'll mark it on your map there.
DOD00001141	Alright, that's all I have for you. Let me know what sorts of valuable intelligence you can squeeze out of Hurst.
DOD00001142	Excuse me?
DOD00001143	Oh, for fuck's sake.
DOD00001144	I'll tell you the same story I've told everyone else, okay? I don't fucking know who Blake is, and I don't give a fuck, neither.
DOD00001145	Yeah, look, I stole some fucking documents, this Blake guy wanted to buy them, he operated through a courier, so I never met him...
DOD00001146	We made our wonderful exchange through a dead drop, so I never fucking met him. That's it. Now, fuck off, NCR.
DOD00001147	You Eddie Hurst? I need to ask you about a guy named Blake.
DOD00001148	Oh, not a company man, eh?  Independent contractor, then? Ha, you're just like me, friendo. I fell into the same old scam.
DOD00001149	Was working for the Burke estate. Clerical bullshit, total garbage. Wasn't trusted with nothing, but I grabbed the good papers all the same.
DOD00001150	That was 14 years ago. Old Henry has more important things to worry about, like his nasty fucking son.
DOD00001151	I met that little fucker a couple of times. Heh. I laughed when I heard what happened to him. Goes to show, you grow up wealthy, you end up an ass.
DOD00001152	Not with the NCR. I'm a third party, just asking some questions for a job.
DOD00001153	That was you? Ha! Good fucking job!
DOD00001154	Did you hear the little bastard confess? Full confession, guilty of all charges, no need for a big show trial.
DOD00001155	Ha! I just know his Senator daddy was waiting in the wings with his corrupt legal team, ready to get the child-rapist off scot-free.
DOD00001156	Nope! Adam spilled his guts to the whole world. I can just imagine how purple the Senator's face got when he saw his "legacy" carted off.
DOD00001157	And let me tell you, some rich-boy senator's son, never worked a day in his life, soft and weak as can be... Locked up in serious prison...
DOD00001158	And that same soft little bitch is in there for fucking kids? Heh, I think little Adam is going to be on the receiving end of his favorite hobby.
DOD00001159	Serves him fucking right, you ask me.
DOD00001160	I'm the one that brought Adam Burke back to trial.
DOD00001161	That was you? Well why the fuck hasn't someone slapped a medal or twelve on your chest? Ha!
DOD00001162	I met that little shit a couple of times. As a kid, I wanted to slap the teeth out of his entitled mouth. Guess he got worse with age.
DOD00001163	Bet his daddy'll never forgive you. That asshole was fucking obsessed with "the Burke Legacy" and his part in it.
DOD00001164	Fuck him. I worked for that prick, and I can say with confidence that him, and that entire family, can all burn in hell.
DOD00001165	I killed Adam Burke.
DOD00001166	Not a liar. I told you the truth already. I told the truth a dozen times. NCR dogs keep coming after me, barking the same bullshit story.
DOD00001167	If I was still in Cali, no doubt they'd have thrown me into a very tiny cell and left me to rot. But the military ain't arresting nobody.
DOD00001168	You know what it is? I think that they're looking for a fall guy. They want to pin all the intel leaks they can onto me, alone.
DOD00001169	And why not? They know I'm good for at least one intelligence brief. I'm a junkie, ha-ha, nobody cares to defend us druggie shits.
DOD00001170	Listen, I know you're just some contractor. Nobody in NCR would lay a finger on that Burke kid, no way. Not with the clout his daddy swings.
DOD00001171	Fuck Blake. I got some dirt on the dirtiest family in the whole fucking country. And I can promise you, they already want you dead, mailman.
DOD00001172	So, you really don't know how to find this Blake guy?
DOD00001173	I want to kick the Burke estate in their balls, friend. And since you've already spat on the Senator's precious legacy, you oughta help me out.
DOD00001174	Mr. Big Senator won't ever forget what you did. He's a vindictive old cunt, and he'll hound your ass until you're dead and buried.
DOD00001175	And I'll tell you what. I can sweeten the pot for you. If you really care that fucking much about that Blake moron, I might be able to help.
DOD00001176	I told you the truth. I don't know where he is, and I've never met him. But I could probably bait him out. Whatever, he don't mean shit to me.
DOD00001177	We got a deal? You'd be fucking crazy to say no.
DOD00001178	What do you want from me?
DOD00001179	Now we're fucking talking.
DOD00001180	The plan is this: I know of three family contacts that ain't blood relations, or weird-loyal servants, like that creep Zed.
DOD00001181	You pick their brains, get them to cough up anything they know about Burke's scheming bullshit, and bring it back here to me.
DOD00001182	We throw it all together, along with everything I know, and all your dealings with Adam the kid-toucher, and we put together the narrative.
DOD00001183	We get everything in place, we release it publicly, and I get your pal Blake to stick his head up to investigate. Everybody wins. Except Burke.
DOD00001184	So, the three contacts I'm aware of, named Paul Winters, Stan Gold, and Kevin Massey.
DOD00001185	Fine, I'm in. What do you have in mind?
DOD00001186	Yeah? Fine, dumbass. I don't give a fuck. You're the one they want dead, so have fun with that.
DOD00001187	I want nothing to do with this. Leave me out of your scheming.
DOD00001188	Massey worked on the Burke's ranch, back west. The Brahmin industry is what made the Burkes rich, and they're still in business.
DOD00001189	Those Brahmin baron types have always been ruthless, but anything that happened on the Burke estate is beyond me.
DOD00001190	Wanna know more, gonna have to talk with someone who was there. Now, I know Massey got arrested a while back.
DOD00001191	But I also know that the prison got busted open, and all the ex-cons are wild and free. Our guy might just be with them.
DOD00001192	Tell me about Kevin Massey.
DOD00001193	Zed? He's the security chief for the Burke estate.
DOD00001194	He does whatever the Burkes need done, and gives them plausible deniability while he's at it.
DOD00001195	Apparently, he's been knocking around the estate, doing the dirty jobs for the head of the family for over a century.
DOD00001196	I'll tell you right now, when Burke cries for your head after that shit with his son, it'll be Zed hiring the assassins for him.
DOD00001197	You mentioned Zed. Who's that?
DOD00001198	Ghoul. Bigger and faster than most ghouls you meet, though. Most of 'em got pretty bad muscle atrophy. Not Zed, though. Guess he works out.
DOD00001199	Zed's been with the family for over a century? Is he a mutant?
DOD00001200	NCR keeps sending their people to interrogate me. If I was in Cali, they'd throw me in a cell and leave my ass to rot.
DOD00001201	As it is, I just get soldiers and freelancers, like you, hounding my ass. Enough's enough of that shit, I say.
DOD00001202	None of those assholes are going to bother fighting through the heart of Khan territory just to have me say: "Dunno where Blake is" again.
DOD00001203	Besides, my buddy Three-Piece is in the Khans. He and I go way back. He vouched for me, so the Khans are okay with me hanging around, for now.
DOD00001204	Why are you in Red Rock Canyon?
DOD00001205	I did clerical bullshit for one of his campaigns, back 14 years ago, I think it was.
DOD00001206	Sure, I wasn't witness to anything too out there. Burke ain't dumb enough to openly discuss his dirty business around random peons like me.
DOD00001207	But I know my fair share of lesser crimes. There was serious embezzlement, bribery, bit of blackmail here or there...
DOD00001208	And of course, he's good buddies with President Kimball. That one ain't so shady on it's own, but we all know he's getting kickbacks from it.
DOD00001209	You worked for Burke. What did you do?
DOD00001210	I did. I was a ranch hand on their estate back in California.
DOD00001211	I'm not particularly interested in politics nor the familial rivalries of Brahmin dynasties.
DOD00001212	I sense you're angling for some sort of specific information, though. What is it?
DOD00001213	I heard you worked for the Burke estate. Care to answer some questions about that?
DOD00001214	Ah, I see what this is.
DOD00001215	Yes, I believe I could tell you a few things that may interest you. However, I'm in a delicate situation here. I'd need something in return.
DOD00001216	Nothing immoral, just helping get me to a safer position than Powder Gang territory. Agreed?
DOD00001217	I'm trying to bring the Burkes down. I need to know if you saw anything suspect.
DOD00001218	Excellent.
DOD00001219	Now, I like to plan ahead. When I was arrested, I contacted a friend of mine in the Mojave to put together a little supply cache for me.
DOD00001220	I didn't expect my exit from prison would be near as explosive as it was, but I did have some vague notions of slipping away one night, sight unseen.
DOD00001221	I've tried several times to contact my friend, but I've have no luck. Knowing how things are, I expect something unpleasant may have occurred.
DOD00001222	If you would be so kind as to head to the tribal village near Goodsprings and retrieve my supplies for me, I would be most grateful.
DOD00001223	I accept your terms.
DOD00001224	Then I'm disinclined to provide you with anything you may desire for your Burke smear campaign.
DOD00001225	If you have a change of heart and find yourself more agreeable, I likely will as well. Until then, adios.
DOD00001226	I'm not doing busywork for you.
DOD00001227	Much obliged.
DOD00001228	Ah, yes, excellent. He even managed to scrounge up an assault rifle. Very handy.
DOD00001229	The village was full of Cazadors? I hope you killed them all, painfully. My friend what put together this supply cache deserved better.
DOD00001230	Well, this will help quite a bit. However, I can't help but notice that there isn't a change of clothes in this box, anywhere.
DOD00001231	I don't believe it would be wise for me to venture into the world, still wearing this nifty blue shirt that proudly advertises my fugitive status.
DOD00001232	Could I trouble you to grab a set of leather armor for me? It would come in handy for a career I'm strongly considering.
DOD00001233	I got that supply cache you wanted.
DOD00001234	Much obliged.
DOD00001235	Now, you wanted to know if I knew of any questionable activities on the Burke estate, yes?
DOD00001236	Here, I got some leather armor for you.
DOD00001237	Oh, went for the reinforced armor, did we? Very much appreciated.
DOD00001238	Now, you wanted to know if I knew of any questionable activities on the Burke estate, yes?
DOD00001239	I got you a set of reinforced leather armor.
DOD00001240	I've taken up work as a bodyguard for hire, on behalf of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
DOD00001241	The Followers don't need any more gunmen protecting the Mormon Fort, but I convinced them that I could take care of tourists, at least.
DOD00001242	I don't make quite as much as I would have if I were working for myself, but I greatly respect the Followers.
DOD00001243	It's nice to have steady work that actually feels like it's doing some good, in addition to lining my pocket.
DOD00001244	What are you doing here?
DOD00001245	Adios.
DOD00001246	I should go.
DOD00001247	Was a ranch hand on their estate back west. With how much land they have, and how many Brahmin, they need all the workers they can get.
DOD00001248	And I know you're referring to the senator. I didn't work for him, though I saw him come to the ranch from time to time.
DOD00001249	The man in charge of the Burke Brahmin enterprise is Tobias Burke, the senator's younger brother. He paid my wages, but otherwise we rarely spoke.
DOD00001250	I was friends with his son, Patrick. He's a good sort.
DOD00001251	What was your job for Burke?
DOD00001252	My employer at the time, yes. I rarely saw the man himself, for a number of reasons.
DOD00001253	The estate was fucking gargantuan, for one. For another, he had a great many employees like myself.
DOD00001254	In any event, I can tell you that he was a fairly harsh sort of individual. He lacked humor, put it that way.
DOD00001255	Last I saw him, he was bedridden. Bad case of the cancer, I understand. Apparently, he's still alive. Barely. He won't be long for this world.
DOD00001256	Tell me about Tobias Burke.
DOD00001257	Patrick? Good friend of mine, really. We're around the same age, and he was oddly keen to see the groundwork of his father's operation.
DOD00001258	When I was off work, we would often spend time at nearby bars, chasing various skirts. All in good fun; he wasn't like his cousin Adam.
DOD00001259	Last time I saw him, he was enlisting in the army. I don't think anybody was thrilled with his decision, but he stuck by it.
DOD00001260	Said that his country needed him more than his dad's Brahmin empire ever could.
DOD00001261	Way I heard it, he's a bonafide war hero now. No doubt his family approves of his military career, now that it brought the family more prestige.
DOD00001262	Tell me about Patrick Burke.
DOD00001263	N-now look, I-I am fully aware that you could kill me right this second, and there isn't much I could do to stop you.
DOD00001264	H-however, my request is o-only a measure to keep myself alive. If y-you don't help me, I'll be dead anyway, even if I talked.
DOD00001265	I assure you, I'll tell the other Powder Gangers nothing but good things about you if you assist me.
DOD00001266	And, uh, I'll also give you all the money I have on my person, j-just as an apology for inconveniencing you.
DOD00001267	Here, please enjoy it in good health.
DOD00001268	You can tell me now, or you can scream it in agony as I crush your skull under my boot-heel.
DOD00001269	Well, one oddity that springs to mind were the women that were trucked in.
DOD00001270	Every few months, a cargo truck would pull into the estate, and a few dozen women would exit the back and head inside. Couple days later, they leave.
DOD00001271	They were very pretty. Not hookers from Reno, which was my initial thought. And there were never any parties or anything.
DOD00001272	I knew better than to start asking questions, so I never did. Hmm, what else...?
DOD00001273	Ah, yes. The estate had a small handful of armed guards, private employees, mind you.
DOD00001274	On one occasion at the nearby bar, I overheard a pair of them having a loud-ass drunken conversation.
DOD00001275	Talking about how they "got that Strauss bitch" the night before, for "the boss".
DOD00001276	Coincidentally, a woman with the surname of Strauss died the night before, in strangely vague circumstances.
DOD00001277	And, this same woman was an old business partner of Mr. Tobias, and apparently they had a rather hostile falling out. She was going to sue.
DOD00001278	That's all I know. Thanks for helping me with that little favor. I'm off to Freeside now. Hopefully I survive the journey.
DOD00001279	Adios.
DOD00001280	That's right. Tell me anything you can.
DOD00001281	This place smells like death.
DOD00001282	Ah, the rich and frivolous, throwing their money around on ostentatious displays of personal indulgence, as a mark of prestige.
DOD00001283	I don't know which number is higher: How many of these sorts I've killed, or how many I've had as anonymous clientele.
DOD00001284	I mean that many of these prospective aristocrats here are frivolous with their own money, as well as with other people's lives.
DOD00001285	A man who earns just enough to subsist will have to be very sure of what he's doing before he will commit to paying somebody like me.
DOD00001286	It lends an appropriate sense of gravity to the decision to have another person killed for your own reasons.
DOD00001287	But men who will cheerfully pay hundreds for a steak, just to pat themselves on the back for affluence, think nothing of paying for death.
DOD00001288	And so, what for most people is a serious decision with grave consequences, becomes just a frivolous bit of cheap revenge for these sorts.
DOD00001289	At the very least, they tend to reserve assassinations for those they deem to be rivals, and not so much for the ones they would consider inferior.
DOD00001290	It's a rare combination of bloodlust, cowardice, wealth, and misanthropy that would compel someone to contract an assassin on total strangers.
DOD00001291	What do you mean?
DOD00001292	I have no moral objections. I don't really have any morals at all, really. An aversion to sadism is the closest I come, I suppose.
DOD00001293	If my price is paid, if my client doesn't telegraph some diabolical plan to stab me in the back, if I believe I can kill the target... I accept.
DOD00001294	I don't care whether the target "deserves" to die, nor do I care how repulsive my client may seem to be. I'm a professional, no more and no less.
DOD00001295	That said, I recognize that in a truly just world, these sorts of men would be lined up against the wall... Myself along with them, no doubt.
DOD00001296	Hm. Surely that's enough pontification for the moment. Shall we proceed?
DOD00001297	If you have moral objections to their missions, why accept the contracts?
DOD00001298	And they're deeply enthralled by the notion that they alone control the world, even as they need people like me to do their dirty work for them.
DOD00001299	Just remember, people like you and I have experienced hardships. Difficulties that force us to adapt to the harsh brutalities of life.
DOD00001300	But these sorts of men are so cushioned, they're devastated if you so much as tell them "no".
DOD00001301	Perhaps they should tread more carefully. Such lifestyle choices tend to make enemies, and they're ill-equipped to survive such encounters.
DOD00001302	Heh.
DOD00001303	Yeah, ultra-wealthy high-society people tend to be stupid and malicious. That's not news.
DOD00001304	I've been saving them up.
DOD00001305	Damn, that was a lot of fancy words, Charlie.
DOD00001306	Shall we kill them all?
DOD00001307	Ugh. Don't mind me if I start breathing through my scarf. I despise the smell of chems.
DOD00001308	[SUCCEEDED] Not overly surprising. It's not really something I devote much thought towards. I try not to think about myself at all, truth be told.
DOD00001309	I suppose I'll eventually get past it. Or I won't. I've learned to live with things being what they are.
DOD00001310	I'm not inclined to sign up for therapy, so I can recount how I was tortured as a child, and now I kill people for a living and feel empty inside.
DOD00001311	I appreciate your concern, however. Thank you.
DOD00001312	Are you aware that you exhibit signs of severe PTSD?
DOD00001313	Ah, the clinic. I've had some extensive work done here. Many of my first few contracts financed the medical enhancements I purchased here.
DOD00001314	Initially? Repairing some of the damage done to me by my owners when I was a child.
DOD00001315	Flushing my system of narcotics and other foreign substances. Then there was tendon damage, broken bones that had healed improperly...
DOD00001316	They offered to give me fertility treatments, but I'm not interested in reproducing. I don't much care for children, so I can do without.
DOD00001317	Once that was all done, I purchased several of their performance-enhancing implants. As many as my body could take, really.
DOD00001318	Heightened reflexes, better eyesight, hearing, etc. Anything that would aid my ability to efficiently kill my targets with little effort.
DOD00001319	What sort of work did the clinic do for you?
DOD00001320	I did not.
DOD00001321	If a rifle has a crack in the stock, or a warp in the barrel, etc, you would go to have repairs done, make it as serviceable as you could.
DOD00001322	But if your rifle was completely melted down into slag, there really wouldn't be any fixing it. Bringing it to a gunsmith would be a waste of time.
DOD00001323	There's an allegory in there somewhere.
DOD00001324	You know, this clinic also offers mental health treatment. Did you receive any?
DOD00001325	Such is life.
DOD00001326	For a group as idealistic as the Followers to be around for as long as they have, they must be willing to make some moral compromises.
DOD00001327	It's not as if my blood money came with a detailed explanation of how I had earned it.
DOD00001328	Besides, I already got paid. I could have spent it on whores or substances. Instead, it funneled into an organization that at least tries to do good.
DOD00001329	As if "good" is some objective, quantifiable goal.
DOD00001330	I feel like the Followers wouldn't approve of your method of financing them.
DOD00001331	True. But, my services don't come cheap, and I'm quite prolific.
DOD00001332	A lawless frontier region, embroiled in a war, with stark class divisions... There's no shortage of work for an assassin in the Mojave.
DOD00001333	It's rare for me to be unable to afford something, and when it does happen, well... I just work that much harder.
DOD00001334	Really? These guys can get pretty pricey, especially with some of those implants.
DOD00001335	Well, first and foremost, I require half of my commission up front. If a prospective client can't manage that, then there's no deal.
DOD00001336	Beyond that, I'm not especially picky. Sometimes a client will be obviously untrustworthy, and I'll decline their contract for my own security.
DOD00001337	The most common reason for me to decline a job, though, is if I don't believe I could kill the target.
DOD00001338	A common example of this would be Caesar. I've been asked to kill him more than once, but I've always refused.
DOD00001339	I see no way for a woman to get anywhere near Caesar, except possibly through slavery. And slaves lack for both weapons, and escape options.
DOD00001340	It isn't viable, and while I consider myself to be a consummate professional, I'm not so dedicated to my career that I'll kill myself in the attempt.
DOD00001341	However, if I accept a contract, it will be carried out. I won't be bribed, intimidated, coerced, or convinced. If I have a target, they will die.
DOD00001342	So, how do you choose your clients?
DOD00001343	Hm. Hidden Valley. An organization with the longevity and secrecy of the Brotherhood tends to build a mystique around itself.
DOD00001344	Their members believe so firmly in their own righteousness that it can be easy to forget that they're only human.
DOD00001345	Standing here in their inner sanctum, it's easier to get some perspective. See the Brotherhood for what it truly is, beneath all the layers of dogma.
DOD00001346	I'm so... disappointed.
DOD00001347	At a glance? I see a propensity for self-indoctrination. Denial of reality. An inability to accept, or even recognize, their own futility.
DOD00001348	A conviction they grasp so firmly that it borders on delusion. This notion that strict adherence to an old doctrine will save them all from reality.
DOD00001349	It's a dream. The dream we all share, until the day that we wake up. The dream that we have a measure of control over anything more than ourselves.
DOD00001350	What do you know about the Brotherhood?
DOD00001351	They follow the doctrine written by their founder, generations ago. They venerate it as if it's some religious text, delivered down from on high.
DOD00001352	They believe that, if they only just follow the words of their codex closely enough, that reality will fold over to ensure their prosperity.
DOD00001353	Even thinking critically about the words of their codex is tantamount to treason for them. Almost certainly, because it would damage the illusion.
DOD00001354	The Brotherhood of Steel, as an ideology, is untenable. The only way for the organization to continue is by violating the doctrine that defines them.
DOD00001355	It's not a failure to adapt to ever-changing circumstances so much as it is... Refusal.
DOD00001356	There's a light at the end of the tunnel, but they turn their back to it and somehow see it as a philosophical victory over everyone else.
DOD00001357	If the rules they followed led them to this... Of what use were the rules?
DOD00001358	I suppose some may see their position tragic. Me, I just find it overwhelmingly pathetic.
DOD00001359	What does that have to do with the Brotherhood's ideology?
DOD00001360	Really? Because I've killed several people with a sharpened piece of metal; one of the least technical objects in the history of the planet.
DOD00001361	If the Brotherhood's goal is peacekeeping, then perhaps they should try actually doing it for once.
DOD00001362	If the goal is to simply sit upon a horde of advanced tech, then it seems as if they've accomplished it already. And yet, they're still dying out.
DOD00001363	It's almost fascinating. The stricter they follow their codex, the more certain the organization's death becomes. And still, they don't waver.
DOD00001364	All the technology in the world can't keep reality at bay. They'll realize this, eventually, when it's far too late to save themselves.
DOD00001365	Advanced technology in the wrong hands is dangerous. I respect the Brotherhood's goals.
DOD00001366	Well, you won't have to wait long. They're surrounded by enemies on all sides, and they've chosen to, almost literally, bury their heads in the sand.
DOD00001367	I wonder, are they truly blind to the writing on the wall, or is it nothing more than willful ignorance?
DOD00001368	Either way, I wouldn't expect it to matter when their end finally comes. And it's fast approaching, I can see that, plain as day.
DOD00001369	The Brotherhood is a threat to the Mojave, and they can't die out soon enough.
DOD00001370	When I was a girl, I used to dream about flight. Leaving the world behind... Now, it's enough if I can just avoid dreaming.
DOD00001371	...
DOD00001372	What?
DOD00001373	So... What's your favorite color?
DOD00001374	...
DOD00001375	...
DOD00001376	...
DOD00001377	Uh... Violet.
DOD00001378	...Apparently.
DOD00001379	So... What's your favorite color?
DOD00001380	Good? I struggle to think of how you could possibly misinterpret the word so loosely that it could ever apply to me.
DOD00001381	I'm good at my job, I suppose. But a good person? No.
DOD00001382	Society as a whole has a fairly basic view of morality. Individual beliefs may waver from person to person, but some things are nearly universal.
DOD00001383	There aren't many who would consider a killer-for-hire to be a good person. And if they did, it would be through an excess of caveats.
DOD00001384	No women, no children, only kill people that "have it coming" in some way or another, etc.
DOD00001385	I do kill women, and children, and people that nobody but my clientele would consider to "have it coming" in any capacity.
DOD00001386	Hence, no society on earth would consider me to be a good person. Fortunately for me, I don't care about opinions.
DOD00001387	Do you consider yourself a good person?
DOD00001388	Oh.
DOD00001389	In that case, I abstain from judgement. Judgement of myself, or of anybody else. It's pointless.
DOD00001390	I don't believe in morality. I believe in actions.
DOD00001391	Morality is a coping mechanism. A method of self-affirmation. An acceptance that a set of unwritten societal rules dictates your value as a person.
DOD00001392	"If I follow the rules of morality, then I am a good person, and I can sleep at night with no guilt." Something to that effect.
DOD00001393	I don't feel any guilt for my actions, yet my only difficulty sleeping comes from my memories of actions that others committed against me.
DOD00001394	I know exactly what I am. I'm a broken shell of a human, but I've reconciled my own nature, and so I don't allow my perception of self to bother me.
DOD00001395	In truth, I don't believe that "bad people" or "good people" exist. I believe that people can commit bad acts, or good ones.
DOD00001396	Do you consider yourself a good person?
DOD00001397	I didn't ask what society thought of you, I asked how you would define yourself.
DOD00001398	Do you?
DOD00001399	Because, by my reckoning, you're a prolific killer. You fraternize with killers, you're employed by killers, you're surrounded by killers.
DOD00001400	Even if you truly believe, with every fiber of your being, that you've never once killed somebody who didn't deserve it... I certainly have.
DOD00001401	As a good person, wouldn't you be morally obligated to kill me, as justice for my own crimes?
DOD00001402	Choosing not to do so... Would be apathy, or something akin to it. Certainly, nobody considers apathy to be a good, ethical trait.
DOD00001403	Now, to be clear, I don't mean any offense. I'm not interested in judging you. As far as people go, I actually respect you quite a bit.
DOD00001404	But you see, I hope, what I mean with this morality business. Trying to live up to a vague ethical standard is an exercise in willful self-delusion.
DOD00001405	Recognize yourself for who you are, not how you, or others, perceive you to be.
DOD00001406	You don't have to like what you see in a mirror, I don't, but there's a victory in knowing what you are. I can say no more than that.
DOD00001407	I like to think I am, yeah.
DOD00001408	But that isn't really true, is it?
DOD00001409	You're aware of your own choices, surely. You're aware of the context and logic behind every step you've ever taken.
DOD00001410	There is very little in the world that we can control. Less than we ever think. But the one thing we have undisputed control over is our choices.
DOD00001411	You know what choices you've made, and you know how society at large would likely frame the ethics of those choices.
DOD00001412	What you lack is a personal determination as to whether or not your actions fall in line with your own moral beliefs.
DOD00001413	I'll make it very simple, because I've figured this out for myself years ago.
DOD00001414	If you truly feel that you cannot live with your own choices, then stop. Shoot yourself in the head and be done with all the guilt and self-doubt.
DOD00001415	Otherwise, stand firm in your convictions, own your choices, and accept that the past is immutable.
DOD00001416	Believe me, there's a victory in that.
DOD00001417	Man, I don't know, Charlie.
DOD00001418	Then why worry about it?
DOD00001419	Nope.
DOD00001420	Great. That's great. She's being indoctrinated into an NCR-saluting little drone.
DOD00001421	I can take some solace in the fact that she's safe, I guess. Still, it'd be nice to know for sure, instead of hearing about things second-hand.
DOD00001422	Who told you she was in California? Some paper-pusher?
DOD00001423	Fuck it, go over his head. If you're still interested in helping me with this family bullshit, maybe you could talk to the guy in charge?
DOD00001424	See if you can chat with the guy running that church. See if he can offer any clarity, I guess. Hell, I don't know.
DOD00001425	Oh, yeah. One other thing came up while you were gone.
DOD00001426	Before you got all wrapped up in the perpetual O'Neill family bullshit, you were helping me with peacekeeping shit, so...
DOD00001427	A friend of mine from out of town is having some raider trouble. I volunteered your name. Sorry, I guess? I don't know if you care.
DOD00001428	Anyway, if you want to help out, the place is called Humboldt Ranch. It's sorta near Bitter Springs. Tell them I sent you.
DOD00001429	Thanks, I appreciate it.
DOD00001430	I went to the church. They said Jessie was on a field trip to California with some others.
DOD00001431	No.
DOD00001432	Well... Actually, I would prefer that the Legion doesn't take power.
DOD00001433	I would have to emigrate west to continue my work. The Legion wouldn't have much use, or tolerance, for my services.
DOD00001434	That said, it would be a mild inconvenience. I have no deeper stake than that. If you were to commit to working for Caesar, I'd accept that.
DOD00001435	Do you have any preference which faction ends up controlling the Mojave?
DOD00001436	No, that won't be an issue.
DOD00001437	I don't leave a calling card on my eliminated targets. Even if they have vengeful friends or family, they wouldn't know I ever existed.
DOD00001438	If somebody does know who I am, and does want me dead for whatever reason, I take care of it before it can become an issue.
DOD00001439	I have no enemies. I don't permit such a thing.
DOD00001440	So... Out of curiosity, any chance of someone coming after you to avenge one of your targets?
DOD00001441	Oh. Well, that's okay, then... Should be, anyway.
DOD00001442	Didn't think Ryan was going to actually try to fix this... Uh... Yeah, probably would have been better if he left it alone.
DOD00001443	Right, look, I appreciate the intent, but the "raider trouble" is the kind of trouble that gets worse the more you mess with it.
DOD00001444	Yeah, if you could just tell Ryan that, I'd appreciate it.
DOD00001445	Ryan O'Neill sent me, said you were having raider troubles?
DOD00001446	If you were a raider, my trigger-happy sister would have put a bullet in your head, not let you waltz in here. Wanna try again, genius?
DOD00001447	[LIE] I'm a badass raider, you'd best do what I say!
DOD00001448	No! None of that, seriously!
DOD00001449	Look, this is pretty delicate, I have things mostly handled right now. There's a lot to be said for not kicking Cazador nests, right?
DOD00001450	Please just leave it be, okay? I know what I'm doing.
DOD00001451	Oh, and before you go, could you tell Maggie not to open the gates for anyone without me giving her the go-ahead? Thanks.
DOD00001452	If the problem is raiders, just point me in their direction and I'll take them out. No problem.
DOD00001453	Alright, good. Thank you. Oh, before you go, could you tell my sister not to open the gate for anyone unless I say so? Thanks.
DOD00001454	Alright, I'll just be going, then.
DOD00001455	Fine. Short version, we're being extorted by a raider crew, led by some prick named Dalton.
DOD00001456	While it's very unpleasant, Dalton's demands have been something we can consistently afford to pay. It's a lot of money, but we can survive.
DOD00001457	And, he's actually kept his word. His crew leaves us alone and keeps other gangs away from us, as long as we pay on time.
DOD00001458	I can't afford to piss him off. It's just me and my sister here. If he wanted us dead, we'd be dead. Or worse.
DOD00001459	I refuse to antagonize him. I can't risk Maggie's life like that.
DOD00001460	So, what exactly is this raider issue that you don't want me to interfere with?
DOD00001461	Our parents established the farm. Maggie and I were born and raised here. We were happy, mostly safe... Everything was fine.
DOD00001462	One day, when I was about 11 or so, and Maggie was only two or three, a raider band, just like Dalton's, came calling.
DOD00001463	Dad didn't negotiate with raider filth. He started shooting. I was young, but anyone growing up in the wastes learns to shoot early, so I helped.
DOD00001464	Mom stayed with Maggie, had to keep her out of danger. After me and dad drove the raiders off, we heard Maggie screaming.
DOD00001465	One of those pieces of shit slipped through the line. Dad and I shot him to pieces, but it was too late. Mom was gone.
DOD00001466	That was about a decade ago. It was hard without mom, but we got by.
DOD00001467	Dad died last winter. Something with his lungs. Cancer, tuberculosis, I don't know exactly.
DOD00001468	I can't protect Maggie by myself. I hate Dalton, I hate his type, but if paying them off keeps my sister and I safe, then so be it.
DOD00001469	How come it's just you two running this whole farm?
DOD00001470	Because I can afford to pay Dalton's protection fees. He's kept his word. Between all the threats and disgusting taunts, he's been honest.
DOD00001471	This is my home. I was born here. My parents are buried here. I'm not going to turn tail and run at the first bit of adversity. I have to endure it.
DOD00001472	Why not leave?
DOD00001473	No. I don't believe you.
DOD00001474	If you failed. If they killed you, or any of them escaped... Anything like that, and we'd be dead.
DOD00001475	I can't risk that. I refuse to risk it. The cost is too high. I'm sorry.
DOD00001476	Let me put Dalton and his crew out of commission for you. It won't be an issue, I promise.
DOD00001477	Up until last winter, I would sometimes take a caravan into the city to trade. I met Ryan when I was bringing some crops to Westside.
DOD00001478	A little while back, he actually sent a message asking if we were alright. I wrote back, and I guess he sent you after he got my letter.
DOD00001479	He's a good man, but he seems to have some fixation on solving all the world's problems. It'll burn him up, mark my words.
DOD00001480	How do you know Ryan O'Neill?
DOD00001481	Jesus Christ, seriously? It's bad enough I have one child needling me about this, now there's a second one?
DOD00001482	My dating life isn't any of her business, and she's family. I don't know what you think your excuse is, but I promise you I'm not amused.
DOD00001483	Your sister seems to think there's something between you and O'Neill.
DOD00001484	Did you need something else...?
DOD00001485	Alright then.
DOD00001486	Because this is what I'm best at.
DOD00001487	My life put me on this path. My experiences, the lessons I learned, the people who educated me... It all led to me being what I am, now.
DOD00001488	The last years of my adolescence were spent teaching me all the fine details required for my profession, and so, I excel at it.
DOD00001489	This is what I am. It's likely not the path I would have chosen for myself, but there's very little in life we can control, let alone predict.
DOD00001490	To do something else... Turn my back on the tools that I was given... It's lashing out, denying my own reality. It's childish, and futile. I refuse.
DOD00001491	After your mentor died, why continue to kill people? You could have done anything you wanted.
DOD00001492	Fatalistic? No.
DOD00001493	That's the opposite of my philosophy. I don't believe in fate, destiny, however you wish to describe it.
DOD00001494	It's all chaos. We, as people, tend to assign our own meanings and interpretations to the chaos, to calm ourselves in the face of it all.
DOD00001495	Events happen to us, often without our consent, or even knowledge. The first step to self-determination is acceptance of our past experiences.
DOD00001496	We can rail against the circumstances we find ourselves in, and so often, it burns us away. It accomplishes nothing but failure and misery.
DOD00001497	There is no greater plan. Nothing is preordained, and things don't need to have a reason before they occur. It is what it is, nothing more.
DOD00001498	It falls to each of us to make our own meanings for things, and live with the consequences.
DOD00001499	That seems so fatalistic, though. Why bother with anything if we're so powerless?
DOD00001500	Well I don't know why she thinks I'd suddenly follow her instructions if someone else delivers 'em to me.
DOD00001501	So, you going to take care of our raider problem for us?
DOD00001502	Your sister wanted me to tell you not to open the gates unless she gives you approval.
DOD00001503	What?! Why? That makes no sense!
DOD00001504	The raiders are the problem! How would killing them make the problem worse? They're robbing us!
DOD00001505	Uh, no. Megan begged me not to mess with them raiders. Said it would make everything worse.
DOD00001506	To hell with that, if someone else bothers us, you can kill them, too!
DOD00001507	I don't care what her opinion is. She's only half of our population, and the other half says that those raiders gotta go! And die, preferably!
DOD00001508	Look, I can pay you. Every cap I got, I'll pay you, if you can get rid of that gang. I promise, I'm good for it. I give my word.
DOD00001509	She says they're keeping other raider gangs from harassing you guys.
DOD00001510	She's such a coward!
DOD00001511	I mean... I love her, and I get why she's like this but... This is stupid. She thinks she's protecting us, but this is the opposite.
DOD00001512	Well... Fine, I'll take care of this. I'm grown enough, I don't need to just wait and let her decide my life for me.
DOD00001513	She won't pay you to protect us? I will. If you can go to Dalton's hangout and kill him and his gang, I'll pay you everything I have. I promise.
DOD00001514	Beats me. I offered to kill them, and she begged me not to do it.
DOD00001515	Yes it is!
DOD00001516	That O'Neill guy sent you over to us, to help with our raider trouble. You came all the way here, from Westside, because he told you to do it.
DOD00001517	I don't care what my sister says. She's only half the population of this ranch, and the other half wants you to finish the job O'Neill gave you.
DOD00001518	I can afford it. I mean it, you deal with Dalton and his gang, I'll pay you every last cap I got. I promise.
DOD00001519	Whatever, it ain't my problem.
DOD00001520	Haha! Yes! We'll show them!
DOD00001521	Well, I mean, I'll be there in spirit. Megan would have a heart attack if I ran off with anyone.
DOD00001522	But you got here all the way from Westside. That's impressive enough. You can take out this raider crew, no sweat. I believe in you!
DOD00001523	Okay, I'm gonna get your reward ready, for once you save us all. Uh, all... two of us.
DOD00001524	Anything you need before you go?
DOD00001525	Okay, I'll do it.
DOD00001526	Well, then get off my property, you coward! I'll just kill them all myself next time they show up.
DOD00001527	No, your money doesn't interest me. Solve your own problems, kid.
DOD00001528	I got... 1,083 caps. It's all yours if you get rid of that stupid gang.
DOD00001529	How much are you offering, exactly?
DOD00001530	Hey, I do my fair share of the work here. I get a share of the earnings.
DOD00001531	...I'd get a bigger share if those raider assholes weren't extorting us.
DOD00001532	But... Yeah... This is my life's savings right here. I'm prepared to give you all of it, that's how important to me this is.
DOD00001533	Aren't you a little young to be throwing thousands of caps around?
DOD00001534	She's scared. Has been most of my life.
DOD00001535	When I was still a baby, we got attacked by a raider band. Megan and our dad fought 'em off, but...
DOD00001536	Ma didn't make it. Megan's never got over it, even if she doesn't wanna admit it.
DOD00001537	She got by while dad was still around, but he died last winter. Now she's trying to do everything by herself, without actually doing anything.
DOD00001538	After what happened with ma, I think... I think Megan got scared of raiders. She couldn't beat them then, so she thinks she'll never be able to.
DOD00001539	Maybe once Dalton's crew is gone, she'll realize that they're weak. Ain't nothing worth fearing, but... I dunno. I just hope it helps.
DOD00001540	Why didn't your sister want me to kill the raider crew?
DOD00001541	Why's that, now?
DOD00001542	Good luck finding any kinda farm out there that doesn't have their kids shooting before they're ten. I picked up a rifle when I was six.
DOD00001543	Besides, this is a 5.56 with minimal recoil. If those weak California troops can handle these, I definitely can.
DOD00001544	So, are you on watch duty or something? Aren't you a bit young for that?
DOD00001545	Well I don't see any reason I should. They ain't helping us any.
DOD00001546	Besides, even if they were here, y'know what they'd say? 'Cause I do.
DOD00001547	They'd say that they'd keep us safe from all the raider gangs and outlaws and crazy wildlife out there, in exchange for a cut of our profits.
DOD00001548	Now... How's that any different than Dalton's crew? They dress better? Give me a break.
DOD00001549	You don't like the NCR?
DOD00001550	I know that.
DOD00001551	She's been bothering me ever since they first showed up. "You could hire some mercs for the money Dalton is demanding, problem solved."
DOD00001552	I tried explaining to her, over and over. If I sent someone off to kill the raiders, and they failed, then we're dead. Or worse.
DOD00001553	I ain't risking it. If I wanted to wager everything I got on something I ain't certain on, I'd move to Vegas.
DOD00001554	Well I'm not changing my mind. I don't care what you say, and I don't much care for her arguments either. Heard 'em all before.
DOD00001555	You know your sister wants me to kill the raiders bugging you guys?
DOD00001556	Fuck off. Ask one of my crew, they'll tell you.
DOD00001557	They'll tell you that I'm Dalton, and I'm the big boss of a whole crew of bad motherfuckers, and I'll piss on your skull if you bother me.
DOD00001558	Who are you?
DOD00001559	I'm the big dog around these parts. But you already knew that, didn't you, sweetheart?
DOD00001560	You can play dumb if you'd like. You knew this was a raider hangout, and you walked in anyway. I know your type.
DOD00001561	Too coy to ask for it up front, so you wanna make a sport of it. Might be I'll keep you for myself, unless you want me to share you with my crew.
DOD00001562	Who are you?
DOD00001563	Whatever you want to call it, I don't much give a shit.
DOD00001564	We're just a bunch of guys that like to drink and fuck and smoke, and most of all, we like raking in the cash and breaking heads.
DOD00001565	Bet you want to join, huh? Too bad. Ain't hiring.
DOD00001566	So, what? You guys supposed to be a gang or something?
DOD00001567	Heh. Gee, I wonder what such an innocent girl like you could want with a gang, hmm?
DOD00001568	You're in luck, all my boys here enjoy a good lay, near as much as we like drinking, chems, and raking in the caps.
DOD00001569	Ain't looking for new hires, but if you wanna go ahead and handcuff yourself to the radiator, you'll fit right in all the same.
DOD00001570	So, what? You guys supposed to be a gang or something?
DOD00001571	I run with badasses, not weak pussies like you. Besides, something's wrong with you. I can see it hanging over you like a fucking cloud.
DOD00001572	Besides, I don't like your face. It makes me wanna do things to it.
DOD00001573	Yeah? Why wouldn't I be a good fit for you crew, huh?
DOD00001574	Whores already got a job, and it ain't gunslinging. Ain't that right?
DOD00001575	Yeah? Why wouldn't I be a good fit for you crew, huh?
DOD00001576	Just a hunch. You roll in here with that weak little bitch energy, I just get a feeling you're hoping to be more than what you really are.
DOD00001577	Keep acting the badass, whatever helps you sleep at night. Just don't go getting a swelled head, or I might just have to cut it off.
DOD00001578	What makes you think I'd ever want to join this shit gang you scraped together?
DOD00001579	Well gee, it might have something to do with the fact that you knew damn well what this place was, and you came inside anyway.
DOD00001580	Go ahead, keep acting like you're above it all. If you think my boys don't enjoy breaking in haughty bitches like you, you're dumber'n you look.
DOD00001581	What makes you think I'd ever want to join this shit gang you scraped together?
DOD00001582	Dalton. Let's see, last time he talked with me about getting a cut of my earnings, my family's earnings... How'd he say it...?
DOD00001583	"If you two bitches can't afford my protection, you could turn this place into a little bunny ranch. You two would be real popular with my boys."
DOD00001584	That give you some notion what kinda guy he is?
DOD00001585	What can you tell me about this Dalton guy?
DOD00001586	Oh, wow, deathclaws. That's scary. I'm scared, since you brought that up. Oh geez.
DOD00001587	Hey retard, deathclaws can't fit through the fucking doors.
DOD00001588	You guys aren't worried about the deathclaws hanging out near your little hideout?
DOD00001589	What the fuck about it? I don't give a rat's ass about fucking farming.
DOD00001590	It's... Call it an investment. Sorta. I ain't investing my cash, but I guess I'll invest the time to send one of my boys up to collect, sure.
DOD00001591	That uppity bitch running the place doesn't know how to run a business, I can tell you that.
DOD00001592	My original offer was I'd keep her place safe, all she'd have to do is let me and my crew play with her and her sister whenever we got the urge.
DOD00001593	And that dumb bitch decided she'd rather pay out of her own pocket than just accept some fun here and there. Idiot.
DOD00001594	What can you tell me about the Humboldt Farm?
DOD00001595	The uppity bitch running that place thinks she's better than us. I know she thinks she's better than you.
DOD00001596	She thinks she's too good to come down here, unlike you. Guess she can't trust herself around so many badass motherfuckers, eh?
DOD00001597	Whatever. Long as she keeps throwing money my way, I'll let her keep her little dirt farm. Fuck her.
DOD00001598	What can you tell me about the Humboldt Farm?
DOD00001599	The fuck...? You trying to muscle me out of my own fucking racket, you cocksucker?
DOD00001600	How about this, you miserable fuck? I ain't doing fuckall for you. The best you can do is convince me not to cave your fucking skull open.
DOD00001601	Well, you'd best either get to begging me for mercy, or begging Jesus to do something nice with your fucking piece-of-shit soul, you cocksucker.
DOD00001602	Tell your crew to stay the fuck away from Humboldt Ranch, or I'll kill you all myself.
DOD00001603	What the fuck... Are you out of your goddamn mind, you stupid fucking cunt?
DOD00001604	Do you have any fucking idea who I am? The things I'll fucking do to you for coming into my fucking house and disrespecting me?!
DOD00001605	My ma told me it ain't right for me to fucking eviscerate women, so I'm going to give you one chance, one fucking chance, to beg for mercy.
DOD00001606	Tell your crew to stay the fuck away from Humboldt Ranch, or I'll kill you all myself.
DOD00001607	I want this motherfucker's head on a fucking spike. Kill his ass!
DOD00001608	I've heard more than enough of you. Do the world a favor and die quietly.
DOD00001609	Nobody fucking talks to me like that, you uppity cunt. You抮e going to wish you were never born.
DOD00001610	I've heard more than enough of you. Do the world a favor and die quietly.
DOD00001611	The fu... Goddamn it, kill this asshole!
DOD00001612	You're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is "micropenis". Weird.
DOD00001613	What the f- Do you have any idea who I am? Kill this bitch, goddamn it!
DOD00001614	You're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is "micropenis". Weird.
DOD00001615	Jesus fucking Christ, get this goddamn lunatic away from me!
DOD00001616	Tough talk. Let's see if you keep it up as I saw you in half while you're still sucking air.
DOD00001617	What the fuck?! Somebody, get this fucking crazy bitch away from me!
DOD00001618	You talk about your dick too much. I think I'll take it away from you and shove it down your throat.
DOD00001619	Really? That's... That's great! I knew you could kill them! Oh man, this is awesome.
DOD00001620	While you were out killing those assholes, I got all my money together. 1,083 caps, like I said. It's yours.
DOD00001621	Yeah, it's done. You guys are safe now.
DOD00001622	Well, don't make us wait much longer, okay?
DOD00001623	Not yet.
DOD00001624	Of course, here you go! Told you I'm good for it.
DOD00001625	Now, uh... Maybe you could also tell my sister about this? I feel like she might get, uh, really pissed with me if I tell her what I did.
DOD00001626	Hmm... Maybe I'll sneak out one night and set that stupid raider base on fire. Don't need any new assholes moving in.
DOD00001627	Thanks again! Really, you're just about my second favorite person right now.
DOD00001628	I'll take that, thank you kindly.
DOD00001629	Are... you serious, right now? You don't want any of my money? 'Cause, y'know, I have it right here.
DOD00001630	Uh, wow. Okay, thank you. I don't really know what to say.
DOD00001631	Well, uh... You should probably tell my sister the good news. She'd probably get mad if I tell her.
DOD00001632	So, yeah... Uh, in the meantime, is it okay if I build a little shrine to you? It'll be really tasteful, promise. Thanks again! Really!
DOD00001633	You need your money more than I do. Keep it.
DOD00001634	What the hell?! Why?! Christ, we're going to die. If we're lucky, we're gonna die. If we're not, we'll be slaves. What the hell did you do that for?
DOD00001635	We could afford Dalton's bullshit protection. Barely afford it, still, but now what's stopping other raider bands from coming here?
DOD00001636	Dalton and his crew are dead. You don't need to worry about them anymore.
DOD00001637	[SUCCEEDED] That... that could actually work.
DOD00001638	I bet... Caravan guards would work. Lemme think... Couldn't poach any from Crimson Caravan, but...
DOD00001639	Wait, I got it. There was some caravan ambushes down near Boulder City recently. I bet you could find some out-of-work guards around there.
DOD00001640	Okay. I need you to find some guards down there. Tell them I'm offering room and board. I'm willing to negotiate about fees, if they show up.
DOD00001641	Thanks. Maybe... Maybe we're not dead after all.
DOD00001642	Hire some actual guards. You can afford it, now that you aren't being extorted.
DOD00001643	[FAILED] Guns aren't the issue, dumbass. There's only two of us here, and one of them is 13.
DOD00001644	What we need are more bodies, people who can... Help us... Huh.
DOD00001645	Guards. We need guards. Probably caravan guards, since they're used to the hours and wages we'd be talking about here.
DOD00001646	So... I heard about some caravan ambushes down near Boulder City. I bet there are some out of work guards milling around down there.
DOD00001647	I need you to speak with them. Tell them that I'm offering room and board, and I'll negotiate fees if and when they arrive.
DOD00001648	I'm counting on you, here. Please hurry.
DOD00001649	Buy better guns.
DOD00001650	Fuck that, you got us into this mess, and you owe us a debt.
DOD00001651	You painted a giant target on our backs, and you're fixing it. We need guards, or something. You're finding them for us.
DOD00001652	I've heard about some out-of-work caravan guards down near Boulder City. Tell them I'm offering room and board. I can negotiate pay if they arrive.
DOD00001653	Get to it, and don't come back until you do.
DOD00001654	Sounds like your problem, not mine.
DOD00001655	Well, I'm Alfie, and that's Jessica and Chang.
DOD00001656	Don't suppose you're running a caravan? We heard about some ambushers hanging around these parts. Gonna need some elite guards, like us.
DOD00001657	Who are you guys?
DOD00001658	Well, as it happens, I'm a veteran, which automatically makes me a certified badass.
DOD00001659	Chang over there's been guarding caravans for the past five years. And Jessica... Has a big machine gun.
DOD00001660	So, pretty damn qualified, if I do say so myself.
DOD00001661	What are your qualifications?
DOD00001662	Hmm... Well, that ain't caravan guarding, but I don't see what that matters...
DOD00001663	Well, shit, worth a shot, I guess. Nobody around this dump is hiring, and getting paid would be a nice change of pace.
DOD00001664	Alright, we'll take a look. Room and board is a good deal. Alright guys, let's head north. See how this turns out.
DOD00001665	How'd you feel about working on a farm? They're offering room and board. Fee is negotiable.
DOD00001666	Thank god.
DOD00001667	Look... I've been really on edge ever since dad died. It's been like every single thing around here was relying on me.
DOD00001668	I haven't been sleeping well. Jumpy all the damn time. Maybe... Not having to watch my back all the time will help.
DOD00001669	We owe you a lot. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask. Thanks, I mean it.
DOD00001670	I found some guards at Boulder City. They seemed solid enough.
DOD00001671	They're fine. Well, mostly fine.
DOD00001672	I don't trust Alfie's soul patch, but other than that, they're fine.
DOD00001673	Hey, Maggie. How are the new hires working out for you?
DOD00001674	Pretty well, actually.
DOD00001675	That Alfie guy sleeps a lot, but he's working graveyard shift, so I don't mind.
DOD00001676	Used to be, I could hardly sleep some nights. Too nervous, knowing we had no guards posted after dark.
DOD00001677	I think... We may actually be okay. Thanks again.
DOD00001678	How's the hired help working out for you?
DOD00001679	I believe I bought my rifle here, years ago.
DOD00001680	Killing all the commanders of this camp would be trivially easy. That the Legion hasn't done so suggests either incompetence, or laziness.
DOD00001681	For a man with nothing interesting to say, he's in no hurry to stop talking.
DOD00001682	The most efficient way to neutralize your target would be to snipe him from afar, before he can speak... It would also make him shut up, for once.
DOD00001683	Old-time bounty hunter. Real effective, real ruthless. 50 years back, you wanted someone dead, you hired Winters.
DOD00001684	Now, when I was working for Burke, I got to see some financial records. 'Bout 40 years ago, the Burke Estate made a lot of payments to Winters.
DOD00001685	Now, it didn't say what he did to earn the money, but... Well, only one thing I know Winters ever did for a career, and that was killing folks.
DOD00001686	So, he killed people for the Burkes, got paid by the Burkes. Probably innocent witnesses or something, since that's the family way.
DOD00001687	Now, I happen to know that he's living in some shack, up by the cliffs north of Vegas. Go there, say hello, see what the old man knows.
DOD00001688	Probably some salacious shit, huh? Hopefully this guy can sink the motherfuckers.
DOD00001689	Who's Paul Winters?
DOD00001690	He killed people for a living, and yet some junkie with a score to settle knows his name and his location. Bounty hunters.
DOD00001691	Senator Burke? I never worked for him. First time I met him, he was a newborn.
DOD00001692	I tracked some bounties for his daddy, Carson Burke. He's been dead... What, twenty years now? Hell, I don't remember.
DOD00001693	What're you after, eh? You trying to get some kinda political dirt on them? Give me a break.
DOD00001694	I understand you worked for Senator Burke.
DOD00001695	Just "a" bounty hunter, huh? Figures, may as well fade into obscurity.
DOD00001696	In my prime, I figured I was the top dog in the Mojave. Any target, no matter how ruthless or well-armed, I killed.
DOD00001697	Young punks with something to prove all came to me, looking to learn my methods, or to kill me and take glory as my killer. Never worked for 'em.
DOD00001698	Tully, Alquist, Pyke... They're "big names" in the business because they're emulating me. Assuming they ain't faded into obscurity, too.
DOD00001699	So, you were a bounty hunter?
DOD00001700	If they've wronged you somehow, grab a rifle and wrong them back.
DOD00001701	Whatever. I was never paid for silence. I don't give a goddamn. Sure, I can tell you about what I did for them...
DOD00001702	...For a price.
DOD00001703	I've got one last score to settle, but my ass is past retirement. I'll be damned if I go to my grave without attending to this, but age beat me down.
DOD00001704	Take care of it, and I'll talk all you want about my work history. Deal?
DOD00001705	I'm trying to bring the Burkes down. Know anything that might help me with that?
DOD00001706	Good. Now... I've killed more folks than I could ever hope to count. And 99 times out of 100, it weren't personal. Just doing my job.
DOD00001707	But this one is about as personal as it gets. See, I wasn't always alone like this. I had a wife. And a son.
DOD00001708	My boy, James, ran himself a respectable saloon. He didn't kill folks for a living, and that was fine by me.
DOD00001709	One night, I was drinking and chatting with the boy. Everything was quiet, until we hear shots in the street. Lady screaming bloody murder.
DOD00001710	James grabbed his shotgun and was out the door before I was even to my feet. I was showing my age twenty damn years ago.
DOD00001711	I hear two more shots as I get to the door. I get outside, there's James, bleeding out like a dog in the street.
DOD00001712	I got out there, just in time to see this goddamn ghoul rev up his ancient motorcycle, and off he went.
DOD00001713	Dennis Godwin. I asked around, that's his name. You kill him for me, I'll say anything you goddamn want.
DOD00001714	Fine, what are your terms?
DOD00001715	Heh. No skin off my back, kid. If this shit matters to you, you gotta play by my rules. If not... Well... Bye.
DOD00001716	I'm not here to do your errands for you, old man.
DOD00001717	Heh. Laslow Pyke, Mr. Aviators. That boy was all business. He mostly came to me for advice on getting the good contracts, not anything about killing.
DOD00001718	He weren't much of a hunter. He preferred to wait for his targets to come to him.
DOD00001719	He'd set up ambushes. Let his targets walk into the explosives he rigged up. If any of 'em survived, Pyke and his boys opened up with the automatics.
DOD00001720	I guess that's one way to do it, sure. Whatever it takes to do the job.
DOD00001721	Tell me about Pyke.
DOD00001722	I was a couple years away from retirement when that motherfucker killed my boy. I was already getting slow, and I couldn't catch up.
DOD00001723	And he may as well've been a ghost. Nobody knew anything more than his name, at most. No contacts, no friends, no hometown. Just a trail of bodies.
DOD00001724	It's ridiculous. Now that I'm almost 80, I finally know where he is... And I can't get there. It's too far. I'm done. I'll never catch him.
DOD00001725	The best I can do... Is see to it that he's down in hell, waiting for me to arrive. I'll be there soon enough.
DOD00001726	How come you never caught Godwin yourself?
DOD00001727	Paul Winters.
DOD00001728	...I don't know who the fuck that is. Someone I've wronged, clearly. Not surprising. I've killed many people. Some of them had friends or family.
DOD00001729	I'm here on behalf of Paul Winters. Seems you owe him a blood debt.
DOD00001730	This old song and dance, eh? I know it well.
DOD00001731	<Attack> I'm here to kill you.
DOD00001732	I've been around since before the war, kid. Everything, everyone I ever cared for is dead. Been dead for goddamn centuries.
DOD00001733	Am I an indiscriminate murderer? Yeah, I guess I am. I don't give a shit. I don't kill people out of some deep, personal animosity.
DOD00001734	I kill them because I don't care. Because they were an obstacle, because they had something they didn't want to part with. Because it was convenient.
DOD00001735	We're all just going through the motions, ain't we?
DOD00001736	So, what? You're just some indiscriminate murderer?
DOD00001737	Me, my wife, our three girls... We didn't live in the city. We lived a few miles out. We weren't in the blast radius. But we were close enough.
DOD00001738	My wife and I did everything we could. But seeing our girls... Their hair falling out, their gums bleeding... It was hell.
DOD00001739	My wife was the first to die. She hanged herself. So... I put my daughters out of their misery. We were all suffering. So I ended it.
DOD00001740	After that was dealt with, I shot myself in the head.
DOD00001741	...And then I woke up. Somehow, I botched my own suicide, with a magnum to my fucking skull.
DOD00001742	I crawled into the desert. I figured something out there would kill me soon enough, but it just never happened. And here I am, 200 years later.
DOD00001743	Why?
DOD00001744	Ah, yes. "I suffered great personal tragedy, and so I'm justified in my psychotic behavior". That's a tired old excuse.
DOD00001745	I don't give a goddamn what "other people" choose to do with themselves.
DOD00001746	I lost everything. Everything that mattered to me, gone. And for what?
DOD00001747	I survived the rads. The process was agony, but I pulled through and stood on the other side.
DOD00001748	What if... if my girls would have done the same? What if I didn't put them out of their misery? What if I just murdered my daughters for nothing?
DOD00001749	So, to be clear, whoever the fuck your friend Winters is, I don't care. I don't care about him, or whoever it was that I killed.
DOD00001750	And I don't care about you, neither. And you know what? I'm tired of talking. Come on and die already.
DOD00001751	And? You're not the only pre-war ghoul. Most of the others don't kill people for no reason.
DOD00001752	You did?
DOD00001753	Then... That's it. I've outlived all my enemies. If anyone out there still wants me dead, I don't know who they are.
DOD00001754	I've been alive for a long time. I've done more than my share of awful things. To think, that after all of that, I'd outlast them all... Insanity.
DOD00001755	Well, a deal's a deal. Anything I did for the Burke Estate, I'll tell you. What do you want to know?
DOD00001756	I killed Godwin for you.
DOD00001757	Guess you'd call it a hitman. Not really any different than my usual bounty hunter work, except these guys weren't wanted by the law.
DOD00001758	And, to be clear, I didn't do any work for the Burke Estate, I did work for one man: Carson Burke, the senator's daddy.
DOD00001759	I killed business rivals, untrustworthy employees, scorned mistresses... Carson weren't into politics like his boy.
DOD00001760	What was your job for the Burke Estate?
DOD00001761	All for the sake of the Burke Brahmin Empire. That's where most of the family's money comes from.
DOD00001762	They ain't the biggest Brahmin family in California, but they're up there. Top five, at least.
DOD00001763	Carson was very selective with his targets. Even if he wasn't personally in politics, he had the ear of a lot of important government types.
DOD00001764	If a Brahmin baron in his neck of the woods was supporting the wrong political factions, Burke gave me the green light.
DOD00001765	Once the head of the family suffered some "accident" in some kinda way, Burke would buy up their assets for himself.
DOD00001766	He got richer, and the opposing political bloc got weaker. And, I got paid. That was the bit that mattered to me.
DOD00001767	Now, most of those folks weren't guilty of nothing more than being in the way. I don't really have any qualms about killing them, but...
DOD00001768	Well, if you're looking for dirt on the Burkes, there you go. Their former patriarch loved him some assassinations.
DOD00001769	Tell me about these business rivals you killed.
DOD00001770	What, are you kidding me? Hell yes, he had mistresses. Tons of 'em.
DOD00001771	He and his wife hated each other. They had two sons, Henry and Tobias, and other than that, they avoided one another, whenever possible.
DOD00001772	So, Carson got his fill from local girls. Now, he didn't like professional whores. He liked to turn respectable girls into whores.
DOD00001773	Socialites, entertainers, the daughters of other dynasties... He'd offer them so much cash, they couldn't imagine turning him down.
DOD00001774	And once he'd had a woman, he'd only have her but that one time. Afterwards, he'd have them thrown out on their asses.
DOD00001775	And if any of them started talking about what a wretched man he was, how he couldn't get away with treating them like that, well...
DOD00001776	World's a violent place. Hard to see it coming if you're the victim of, say... A mugging gone wrong, for one example.
DOD00001777	Burke had mistresses?
DOD00001778	Oh yeah. See, I wasn't ever in Carson's inner circle. He has himself a little elite squad of killers and thugs, answered only to him.
DOD00001779	They generally handled "internal" business for the family. I was mostly kept on retainer to deal with issues that needed some plausible deniability.
DOD00001780	But, on the rare occasion that one of his private security people got cold feet, someone outside the security team would have to take them out.
DOD00001781	Otherwise, they could run and squeal about whatever shady business they were doing on behalf of the boss. They knew things no-one else did.
DOD00001782	As the nutjobs across the river might say: "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"
DOD00001783	Untrustworthy employees?
DOD00001784	My problem? Gee, well, I guess it's that I have some random slack-jawed cunt drooling over me, while I'm trying to eat and chat with my buddy.
DOD00001785	The slack-jawed cunt is you, by the way.
DOD00001786	Other than that... I'm great! Golden even! Heh. I'm rich, I'm gorgeous, I've got serious actresses and musicians, lining up to suck my fat cock.
DOD00001787	So, I'll say again: What. The fuck. Do you. Want?
DOD00001788	Whoa, what's your problem?
DOD00001789	Yeah? Well, I want the first lady to give me a handy next time I'm eating dinner with the president, but we don't always get what we want.
DOD00001790	Oh, wait, she'd totally do that if I waved some of my mega-millions in her face. Guess it's just cretins like you that have to be disappointed. Aww.
DOD00001791	Why the fuck should I bother talking to you about whatever inane bullshit that you want to natter on about?
DOD00001792	I want you to tell me your business with the Burke family.
DOD00001793	Awwww, did I hurt the widdle baby's widdle feelings? Booooo fucking hooooo, poor baby.
DOD00001794	Fuck you. I'm so rich, they need to invent a new word to describe just how fucking loaded I am.
DOD00001795	And you know what that means? It means I can piss on little peasant bitches like you - with impunity.
DOD00001796	Well, you could try being polite. That might be a good starting point.
DOD00001797	Whoa, whoa, th-this is my bad, Ha-ha, sometimes silly 'ol Stan gets a little too rough with his harmless teasing.
DOD00001798	Look, friend, I'm real sorry if I got under your skin. Wasn't my intention, honest!
DOD00001799	Let's start over, as the good, good, friends that we clearly are. Oh, yeah, uh, as a sign of my friendship, here's a buddy-gift, right?
DOD00001800	Now, what can ol' Stan do for you, eh?
DOD00001801	Reciprocity wouldn't stop me from breaking that bottle, and gouging your fucking eyes out with it.
DOD00001802	Fuck off, bitch. We're in a casino, which means you're disarmed. The security here though, they're packing. Try anything, you're dead.
DOD00001803	And even if you dodge them, got an army of them secura-troid contraptions outside, along with a squad of grunts with zappy-batons.
DOD00001804	Your threats are as empty as your skull, so why don't you make your mommy proud, and go find a dick, choke on it, and fuck off away from me.
DOD00001805	That wasn't a request. Show some respect, or I'll put a boot up your fake-tanned ass.
DOD00001806	Uh... I'm... Not a gambler, so... I dunno?
DOD00001807	Haha, I was just joshing with you, amigo. I tease rough, no need to get your hackles raised, right?
DOD00001808	Now, uh, what is it that your ol' pal Stan can do for you, eh?
DOD00001809	And you think I couldn't snap your neck before the Chairmen stop me? That's your wager?
DOD00001810	Bitch please, I got fat titties slapping me in the face every night. If I can survive that, I can handle whatever weak shit you throw my way.
DOD00001811	Hey man, you keep that up, and I'll whack you in the nose. Is that what you want?
DOD00001812	Fine, bitch-tits. Fine. You want my attention, priceless as it is? I got a deal for you, sure.
DOD00001813	How about this deal? There's this snooty cunt in the Ultra-Luxe. Names... Something trashy, forget it.
DOD00001814	Anyway, she spat on my shoes, my fucking two-thousand dollar shoes, because she got offended when I offered to pay her to blow me.
DOD00001815	Go find the skank, steal her panties, bring 'em back to me, and you'll have my attention. Briefly.
DOD00001816	Look, maybe we can make a deal.
DOD00001817	Get fucked.
DOD00001818	I should go.
DOD00001819	True, true, pretty sure the doctors call my condition "penis gigantis" or something like that.
DOD00001820	Hey fuckpump, you wanted to make a deal, that's my fucking deal. Don't like it? Get fucked.
DOD00001821	You're sick, you know that?
DOD00001822	See? I say jump, and you fucking peons leap. Ha! I love it!
DOD00001823	Right, so the bitch is at that shitty casino with all the masked clown perverts running around. Go on little doggy, fetch!
DOD00001824	Fine. I'll steal the fucking underwear for you. Prick.
DOD00001825	Oh, look at you, so upstanding and pure! Good for you!
DOD00001826	Meanwhile, I'm rich and successful, you fucking puritanical cunt. Get out of my fucking face.
DOD00001827	You're disgusting. I'm not stealing some woman's underwear for you.
DOD00001828	He's a bigshot entertainment producer, and one of the wealthiest men in the republic.
DOD00001829	He gets serious kickbacks from the burgeoning music industry, he owns some venues here and there, got some fingers in the theater business, too.
DOD00001830	But, by far, the biggest source of his cash is porn. Anyone who whacks off to anything other than their own imagination is probably financing him.
DOD00001831	Naturally, he's a big campaign donor, but I saw some of Burke's financial records when I was working for him.
DOD00001832	Burke was making sporadic payments directly to Gold. Big money, this ain't a man purchasing some dirty holotapes, you know?
DOD00001833	There's something going on behind the scenes, and we're gonna blow it wide open.
DOD00001834	Word is, he's in Vegas for a while. Scouting some investment opportunities. Scope him out, see what he knows. This could be big. He's a dirty fuck.
DOD00001835	Tell me about Stan Gold.
DOD00001836	Aww yeah, haha! Ooh, smells like pretentious pussy. Hehehe.
DOD00001837	Alright, you whiny fuck. I'm a man of my word. What the fuck do you want, from me, huh?
DOD00001838	Here, I got the underwear for you, you nasty motherfucker.
DOD00001839	I tried hiring prostitutes back when I was just getting started. Thought maybe a professional would help me feel something. I was wrong.
DOD00001840	Whoa, whoa, how do you know about that? That's some private business, okay?
DOD00001841	Whatever. Fine, yeah, look, I throw some pretty big parties, back home.
DOD00001842	I'm a big deal, right? I run in important circles. Lot of affluent guys attend. We have some drinks, it's a great time.
DOD00001843	But, hosting parties for the most important folks in the NCR can get pricey, even for a rich-ass motherfucker like me, okay?
DOD00001844	I ask, totally friendly, I ask some of my wealthy guests to kick a little cash back my way, that's all.
DOD00001845	Why has Senator Burke been paying you out of his own pocket?
DOD00001846	Scars don't heal. They just... Fade away over time.
DOD00001847	That's all I have. Scars, both literal and psychological. The damage was done years ago. I spent some time... Coping, I suppose you could call it.
DOD00001848	Sometimes, the best treatment is time. I'm in no danger of going on a homicidal rampage, nor of slitting my own wrists.
DOD00001849	Now, I think the best thing for my mental health right at this moment would be to discuss something else. Shall we?
DOD00001850	I respect that, but I think you should reconsider. You won't get better if you don't try.
DOD00001851	That's it! Honest!
DOD00001852	Hey, my shit is well fucking worth it. I got cash, I got perfect-ten sluts on lock, you best fucking believe I party like a fucking god.
DOD00001853	Is that it?
DOD00001854	I got my boy Jansen, he fucks bitches like a... like a fucking... uh, like a machine that was designed to fuck bitches. Yeah!
DOD00001855	And that there pair of titties is Layla, some whore with big ol' dreams of superstardom. I might make her dreams come true, if she persuades me.
DOD00001856	Who are your friends?
DOD00001857	Oh, it's all very serious business, right? But, my fucking business is pleasure, so this is a fucking lucrative vacation, feel me?
DOD00001858	First off, I'm here to buy up a little independent smut studio. That's how I became the goddamn Porn King of California, you know.
DOD00001859	You ever see any of them "Busta Nutt" skin flicks? Shit's tight, so I'm buying up Alberta Studios, and getting my share of the cash.
DOD00001860	I heard their lead actor broke his contract, but whatever. I'll just force 'em to cast my boy Jansen in the lead role. Whatever.
DOD00001861	Also, New Vegas is fucking flooded with skanky whores that will degrade themselves any which way for a fat payday.
DOD00001862	Nothing like seeing a bitch with delusions of classiness, getting down and dirty for a quick buck. That's my fucking production motto, motherfucker!
DOD00001863	What brought you to Vegas?
DOD00001864	Well, it seems that poor ol' Adam got sick of being given his own medicine. Lil' bitch hanged himself in his cell last night.
DOD00001865	Yeah, yeah, I got word from one of my sources back west. Adam's prison life consisted of daily beatings and non-consensual fun in the showers.
DOD00001866	Exactly the same shit that sick fuck liked to inflict on his victims. Well, they're still alive, while he's swaying from the light fixtures.
DOD00001867	Ha! Oh man, what a fucking piece of shit he was. That's just... poetic. Such a beautiful end to such a repulsive cunt-creature.
DOD00001868	Well, no doubt his senatorial daddy is gonna blame you for this. Guess you're in it all the way with me now, mailman.
DOD00001869	Anyway, that's your bit of good news for the day. What'd you want to chat about?
DOD00001870	What are you talking about?
DOD00001871	That right? Shit, normally I'd suggest you stick his head in a vise, but I don't think you can get away with that in the middle of the Tops.
DOD00001872	Well... Lemme think... Uh... Oh, I got it.
DOD00001873	You just gotta assfuck him with insider info. Really break his spirit, right?
DOD00001874	In addition to all the cash he got from Senator Burke, I happen to know he's been sending some of his own money to a different Burke.
DOD00001875	The fucking reverend, of all people. Why a porn producer would be paying off a fucking clergyman, well... It's probably shady, right?
DOD00001876	Too bad for him, the reverend is right here, in the Mojave. I bet he'll know something that would make Stan really shit himself.
DOD00001877	Lessee, the church should be down near the Aerotech refugee camp. Go and chat with the reverend, see what intel he's sitting on, yeah?
DOD00001878	Gold is holding out on me. I know he isn't giving me all the details.
DOD00001879	Of course I know him. We're first cousins.
DOD00001880	I haven't seen him a while, however. He's quite focused on his political career, whereas I try to keep my concerns centered on spiritual matters.
DOD00001881	I probably don't need to tell you this, but the soul of the Mojave is in grave danger.
DOD00001882	This place seems to bring out the worst in people. Personal greed above all else, the glorification of wealth and hedonism... Terrible.
DOD00001883	And now, with the Legion poised to assault the Hoover Dam, the entire Mojave is in peril. I pray the NCR can be our salvation.
DOD00001884	Do you know Senator Burke?
DOD00001885	I did, yes. I know pride should be avoided, but I can't help myself from taking some satisfaction in the good work that we're doing.
DOD00001886	The Republic has done an exemplary job in reigniting the flames of the old world. Between the government and OSI, we're well on our way to recovery.
DOD00001887	But, something that always stood out to me as a boy, was the NCR's foundation seemed to lack any ties to God. Only men.
DOD00001888	I founded Burke Ministries to correct this oversight, and bring the good news to our citizenry.
DOD00001889	Our facilities back west are more impressive, of course, but I felt the Mojave needed spiritual aid even more than California did. So here I am.
DOD00001890	You founded this church?
DOD00001891	Crimes? Surely you're exaggerating, yes? Hen- The Senator is, I will confess, a touch on the ruthlessly pragmatic side, yes...
DOD00001892	Alas, I think that mindset is an unfortunately common side-effect of playing the political game. I'm grateful I chose to focus on God.
DOD00001893	Please, don't begrudge the Senator for playing into his role. It's the system itself that we need to reform, and that's what I aim to do.
DOD00001894	Unless... You're referring to that unfortunate business with Adam. That... reeked of criminality, I'm sad to say.
DOD00001895	I understand that Adam is no longer with us. I pray for his soul, and I'm keeping his father in my thoughts.
DOD00001896	Are you aware of your cousin's crimes?
DOD00001897	Ah, I'd only met him a few times, when he was a young boy, you understand. I haven't been present in California itself for... 14 years now, I think.
DOD00001898	Adam's choices, monstrous as they were, belonged to him alone. I'd never want to imply that his father could bear any culpability, but still...
DOD00001899	I often wonder, if Adam had been given more religious education as a boy, if he would have turned out differently?
DOD00001900	May I ask, what's this about? Adam, his father...?
DOD00001901	Did you know Adam, reverend?
DOD00001902	Oh, my.
DOD00001903	I'm sure you had your reasons. I understand that Adam was a fugitive, and may not have been willing to surrender peacefully.
DOD00001904	But you should know, killing a man, for any reason, is not a choice to be made lightly. It can carry grave consequences, in this life, and the next.
DOD00001905	You should seek forgiveness while you can. Those who live by the gun tend to die by it, often when they least expect it.
DOD00001906	I'm the one that killed Adam.
DOD00001907	Ah, I see.
DOD00001908	Well, I thank you for your service, and for your mercy while dealing with him.
DOD00001909	I was surprised when I heard that he had taken his own life. It only further cements my belief that he lacked an understanding of spirituality.
DOD00001910	Regardless, thank you once again.
DOD00001911	I'm the one that brought Adam in alive.
DOD00001912	Did you? Well, I'm sorry for your loss. I'll pass Henry your sympathies when I see him next.
DOD00001913	[LIE] I was friends with Adam a few years back, that's all.
DOD00001914	I wish that the papers would print words of spiritual encouragement and compassion, instead of this exploitative muckraking tabloid dreck.
DOD00001915	Adam's sins were great, but I hope that we may learn from his mistakes, and forgive him his trespasses.
DOD00001916	Oh, just read about it in the papers. Wanted to hear your take.
DOD00001917	Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't know the specifics about that sort of thing.
DOD00001918	We do organize field trips so that our students can see the NCR, but I'm not the one that handles the details of that program.
DOD00001919	You'd be wanting to speak with Deacon Paulson, but he's the one leading the California trip. You'll have to wait for their return.
DOD00001920	Can I help you with anything else?
DOD00001921	I'm trying to see one of your students, named Jessie O'Neill. I was told she's out of state?
DOD00001922	I'd be curious to know where you learned that bit of information.
DOD00001923	I preferred to keep financial records like that private to avoid this precise conversation. Very well.
DOD00001924	I find Mr. Gold's choice of profession to be repulsive and an overall detriment to the community.
DOD00001925	Be that as it may, my primary concern is to always aim for the greater good, and his financial contributions are a means to that end.
DOD00001926	Maintaining the ministries requires a good deal of money. Expanding our programs requires even more.
DOD00001927	The donations we receive from our congregation are very appreciated, but they aren't enough to keep our ministries operational.
DOD00001928	The price of the good work we do is, unfortunately, paid in part with dirty money. I'd ask that you don't spread that around, if you don't mind.
DOD00001929	Why is it that Stan Gold, the porn producer, is sending you payments?
DOD00001930	Oh, I couldn't tell you. I assume he's trying to buy his way into heaven, in lieu of actually changing his behavior.
DOD00001931	Regardless, his money is being put to good use, and for that, I am willing to overlook his profession and... Mannerisms.
DOD00001932	Why is Stan paying you, though?
DOD00001933	It's not my place to pass judgement, although I confess that speaking with Mr. Gold wasn't particularly enjoyable.
DOD00001934	He wasn't on good behavior, either. I'd prefer he not return to our establishment again, unless he's looking to learn from us.
DOD00001935	Sounds like you've met Mr. Gold. Charming man, isn't he?
DOD00001936	Hmm? Oh, forget I mentioned anything. It's not my place to discuss.
DOD00001937	Was there anything else I can help you with?
DOD00001938	What do you mean? What did he do?
DOD00001939	Oh. Yes. Him.
DOD00001940	He was here, and I truly hope he never returns. He made a great deal of disgusting comments towards me.
DOD00001941	And when he left, he took one of our interns with him. I assume he promised her an outrageous amount of money.
DOD00001942	I understand that Stan Gold, the porn producer, visited here? Am I correct?
DOD00001943	Yes, he did.
DOD00001944	I believe her name was... Uh... Raya, I think. Decent student, but, well... Maybe not so devout, evidently.
DOD00001945	We never saw her again. I'd rather not know what sorts of jobs he assigned to her.
DOD00001946	He took an intern?
DOD00001947	Ah, well, there's a load of things I never wanted to think about again, all wrapped up in one convenient question.
DOD00001948	Yeah, I was enrolled in that church. I wanted to learn medicine, and they didn't charge anything.
DOD00001949	The Followers in Freeside don't really have the personnel to teach wannabe doctor idiots, so I sprung for the church, instead.
DOD00001950	Then, one day, in strolls that fucking prick, Gold. He had a meeting with the reverend, but he didn't leave after it was done.
DOD00001951	Instead, he patrolled the church grounds, looking at everyone there. Then he comes to me, says he'll give me five grand to follow him to California.
DOD00001952	Said if I refused, the reverend would have me kicked out of the church anyway. 5000 was more caps than I'd ever seen before, so I went along.
DOD00001953	What can I say? I was a very stupid 15-year-old.
DOD00001954	I understand you left Burke Ministries at the urging of Stan Gold.
DOD00001955	Yeah, yeah. So, as soon as we got out of the church, I got directed into the back of a truck, with Stan.
DOD00001956	Well, the second the doors shut, Stan starts barking questions at me. "Are you a virgin? You got a clean bill of health? Can you act?"
DOD00001957	He said he'd make me a movie star, and I'd get paid accordingly, but, first he needed me to "pass an oral examination."
DOD00001958	Well, that's me slipping some euphemistic double-entendre in there. His actual words were, and I quote: "Suck my fat cock, bitch."
DOD00001959	Then what happened?
DOD00001960	Trust me, you're not the first person to think that.
DOD00001961	The reverend spared no expense when it came to our security. We have emergency shutters that can block off the doorways, if necessary.
DOD00001962	We also have a small security force, led by Mr. Brecker. They keep watch outside the building, and so far we've had no trouble.
DOD00001963	And, in the worst case scenario, we have an emergency exit a little past our student's sleeping quarters.
DOD00001964	Is this building safe from outlaws? It seems like they'd have an easy time breaking in.
DOD00001965	He's our security chief. He doesn't really talk much, but the reverend pays him to keep us safe from raiders, and he's done a fine job so far.
DOD00001966	Who is Mr. Brecker?
DOD00001967	You bet your ass he was.
DOD00001968	Gold kept saying he paid Burke good money to buy my ass, so I better not disappoint him.
DOD00001969	Anyway... After that was done with, the truck pulled up by some old warehouse. Stan told me to stay in the back of the truck.
DOD00001970	He got into the passenger seat up front, and suddenly a dozen other women climb into the back of the truck with me.
DOD00001971	Stan tells us all not to speak, and then we drive off. Was packed into the back of that truck for goddamn hours. Only got one bathroom break.
DOD00001972	That's disgusting. Do you think the reverend was in on this?
DOD00001973	Hmm... No, I think that's enough of pro bono storytime with Granny Raya.
DOD00001974	I'm not a complete moron. I can tell you're compiling some sort of evidence. Sounds like... Something that would implicate Burke, yes?
DOD00001975	I can give you all the details you want, but I want something in return. Specifically, vengeance for destroying my life.
DOD00001976	Kill Stan for me, and I'll sing whatever song you like, with paperwork to back it up. Otherwise... I'm not in the mood to chatter away anymore.
DOD00001977	Deal?
DOD00001978	Where did the truck take you?
DOD00001979	Good to know.
DOD00001980	Well, I'll leave you to it. Word of warning, he's connected in the NCR. If you're going to kill him, best do it quietly.
DOD00001981	Have fun. If you've spoken with him, I'm sure killing him will be cathartic for you, as well.
DOD00001982	Fine, I'll kill Stan for you.
DOD00001983	Ha! I knew you were hot for me. Most ladies are, you know. I turn respectable girls into dirty whores. It's a gift.
DOD00001984	Alright, I got some free time. Let's go. Get ready to see the biggest dick in your miserable fucking life. Ha!
DOD00001985	Hey Stan, your charming personality has me really hot and bothered. Let's go to your room, alone.
DOD00001986	[SUCCEEDED] Well, damn. You have better taste than I expected. How fucking nice for you.
DOD00001987	You know what? I think I'll attend to this. Maybe you aren't completely retarded after all. Heh.
DOD00001988	I got a couple classy Brahmin heiresses heading for your room. They want to meet you, alone.
DOD00001989	[FAILED] I'm fucking eating, you asshole. Bother someone else. Jesus.
DOD00001990	Can you... Give me financial advice? Somewhere secluded and quiet?
DOD00001991	With a personality like that, I'm truly shocked that he lived for as long as he did. Nobody will miss him.
DOD00001992	Yeah... Well... Fuck you! You can't just kill people in the casino! If security did their fucking jobs right, you don't even have guns!
DOD00001993	And, uh, even if you did have guns, the security assholes have guns, too! You shoot me, they shoot you!
DOD00001994	A-and... I'm a big deal in the NCR! I'm, like, more important than the president! Everyone in California that watches porn owes me their lives!
DOD00001995	Yeah... Yeah, I'm not scared of you, fucker!
DOD00001996	I've been hired to kill you. Any reason I shouldn't do it?
DOD00001997	Fine, fine! Just stay the fuck away from me, you fucking psychopath!
DOD00001998	Here's some money, now fuck off! I'm out of this fucking city! You people are fucking deranged!
DOD00001999	Jansen! Hooker! Let's go!
DOD00002000	I could be persuaded to tell my client you're dead... For a small fee. What do you say?
DOD00002001	J-Jansen! Save me!
DOD00002002	<Attack> I just wanted you to know that I was going to kill you, you loathsome piece of shit.
DOD00002003	Wow, I had no idea that not having money made your sense of humor so fucking stupid, you inbred fucking retard.
DOD00002004	Get the fuck out of my face, you stupid fucking cunt.
DOD00002005	Haha, I was just kidding. You should have seen the look on your face.
DOD00002006	Stan! No!
DOD00002007	Well... Good. That's good. I hope you actually did kill him, and you're not just telling me what I want to hear.
DOD00002008	Well, a deal's a deal. I'll give you the salacious bits I know you're really looking for.
DOD00002009	So. Me and a bunch of other girls were in the back of a truck, driving to California.
DOD00002010	We arrived at some big ranch estate, and we all got herded out to some building with beds for us.
DOD00002011	Some of Stan's makeup people came and made sure we all looked our best. Then some guys with guns showed up.
DOD00002012	The gunmen said we were going to be the "entertainment" at a high-society party, and if we didn't behave ourselves, we'd be shot.
DOD00002013	They meant it, too. Next night, we're dropped off at Stan's mansion and told to mingle with rich, important fucks.
DOD00002014	If any of the rich assholes wanted us, we had to go along with it.
DOD00002015	Stan Gold is dead.
DOD00002016	Well, him and Stan were the real winners. See, Stan's mansion has a lot of bedrooms. And they're all bugged with cameras and hidden mics.
DOD00002017	All of those rich, important men, most of 'em were married. And even if they weren't, a decent number of us girls were a few years underage.
DOD00002018	Stan got blackmail on all of 'em. And he sold his blackmail material... To one Senator Burke.
DOD00002019	See, I shouldn't know this, but after the party, I went to ask Stan for the five grand he promised me. Stupid, I know.
DOD00002020	I was about to knock on his door, but I stopped when I overheard him and the Senator discussing the price for the previous night's blackmail.
DOD00002021	I ran back to the rest of the girls, and we got shipped back to Vegas that afternoon. None of us got paid.
DOD00002022	And that was the end of my dreams of practicing medicine and making anything of my life. Hence, I truly hope you killed Stan for me.
DOD00002023	What does this have to do with Burke?
DOD00002024	Right. Yeah, some hooker runs to the paper and starts screaming about a conspiracy she witnessed between two of the NCR's richest men.
DOD00002025	I'm sure that would have gone really great for me. Can't believe it slipped my mind.
DOD00002026	You didn't expose this story to the press or anything?
DOD00002027	Eh, no reason for me to start now. Thanks, though.
DOD00002028	Take care of yourself, Raya.
DOD00002029	Are... Are you serious?
DOD00002030	I... Don't even know what to say, besides... Thank you. I owe you... Everything. And I'll never be able to repay you for this.
DOD00002031	I'll... I'll use this to pay my way back to California. Fuck that church; I'm signing up with the Followers.
DOD00002032	Thank you again... So much. I promise, I'm not going to waste this. You have no idea what this means to me.
DOD00002033	One second. It seems like you're owed 5000 caps. Take it. Think about studying medicine again.
DOD00002034	A man with a nice hat. Have a nice day, pardner!
DOD00002035	Who's it from?
DOD00002036	Catch ya later, pardner!
DOD00002037	Okay, thanks.
DOD00002038	Not since those inbred moonshiners all got shot up. Moving caravans through their "territory" was pretty nerve wracking, I have to say.
DOD00002039	You'd think us frontier ranchers would have some solidarity, but apparently that'd be asking too much. Whatever, they won't be missed.
DOD00002040	Any other outlaw troubles bothering you guys?
DOD00002041	Smarter people than I have analyzed the futility of gambling on games of luck. All I have to add is that the games are incredibly boring, as well.
DOD00002042	I've seen more than my fair share of ghettos. They're all alike in the same ways. Perhaps poverty and degradation are the great human unifiers.
DOD00002043	I've never claimed to follow some immutable code of ethics. I consider such things to be contradictory and pointless.
DOD00002044	Take killing, for instance. It's something we both do a good deal of, and it's a topic that is society is frustratingly ambiguous about.
DOD00002045	Most religious texts forbid killing, most societies have very strict laws about killing, and most people would readily agree that it's a bad thing.
DOD00002046	And yet, war is glorious, targeted vengeance holds an air of romantic drama, and self-defense is lauded across the wasteland.
DOD00002047	"Ah, but, it's okay, because you were killing the enemy" is the inferred technicality. Yet that too is contradictory.
DOD00002048	If all sins are excusable when committed upon the "enemy", why is it that we define and punish war crimes? Why praise empathy and understanding?
DOD00002049	It's meaningless. Morality is what you choose to make of it, and I place no stock in the ethical values held by polite society. Whatever that is.
DOD00002050	I was raised apart from society. I only entered it in the tail end of my adolescence. I can rightly say that I am not a part of it.
DOD00002051	I don't live by some personal code. The closest that I come is avoiding pointless cruelty and sadism. Why fret over the minutiae?
DOD00002052	I'm curious, what exactly is the code of morality you live by?
DOD00002053	I have a question, if you'll indulge me.
DOD00002054	Do you support the NCR? Generally, I suppose, but specifically in regards to their desire to annex the Mojave. Everyone seems to have an opinion.
DOD00002055	Okay, go ahead.
DOD00002056	Not particularly. Government agencies as well as private citizens make for prolific, and lucrative, work.
DOD00002057	That said, I've spent the majority of my professional life in the Mojave as it is now: Lawless and untamed. There's never been a shortage of work.
DOD00002058	However, the NCR seems less honest. The very fact that they make use of my services, while simultaneously espousing rule of law is proof of that.
DOD00002059	The appeal of a democratic government is giving its citizenry a voice in the decisions that affect its entire society, I understand.
DOD00002060	And yet, so often the people involved are entirely self-interested, to the detriment of the citizens it's supposed to represent and defend.
DOD00002061	It's a system rife with hypocrisy, corruption, and vice; all the while preaching about the evils of these traits, and how they must be purged.
DOD00002062	I suppose I'm morbidly curious as to why it is that people on the ground level, the ones most liable to be crushed by government, would support it.
DOD00002063	Hence, my original question. Do you support it?
DOD00002064	Do you have a preference? Why are you asking me for mine?
DOD00002065	I see. I can't fault your decision. If nothing else, it would promise to be very lucrative.
DOD00002066	Governments like to claim that they exist to benefit the people on every level of its society. Yet, they're often most beneficial to individuals.
DOD00002067	Winning the Mojave for the NCR would make you rich, famous, and respected. You could do nearly anything you'd like, with impunity.
DOD00002068	I do support the NCR, yes.
DOD00002069	Fair enough. I have no personal investment in what system of government the Mojave chooses to accept... Or is forced to accept, as the case may be.
DOD00002070	I believe we are each answerable only to ourselves, alone. I see no benefit in spreading a system that espouses an opposing ideology.
DOD00002071	I'll kill who I'm paid to kill, and leave military matters to those who care for such things. It's no business of mine... Nor of yours, evidently.
DOD00002072	I have no intention of supporting the NCR in this war.
DOD00002073	Is it? My understanding is that the NCR's inability to safeguard its people on the fringes of its territory is the primary reason so many detest it.
DOD00002074	Many complain about heavy taxation, but from what I've seen, the real issue is heavy taxation with no benefits to show for it.
DOD00002075	The people living deep in NCR territory are supplied with power, water, food, education, and relative safety.
DOD00002076	To live under such comparatively luxurious standards is worth a bit of taxation for most of the citizenry in question... Most of them, anyway.
DOD00002077	But that's only the heart of their civilization. On the outskirts, it's a very different story. They pay the same taxes, with nothing to show for it.
DOD00002078	Then, combine that with their tendency to overlook the activities of criminal elements, like me, if it benefits them.
DOD00002079	I believe their priority is profit. It would be ludicrously hypocritical of me to condemn them for that, but you seem to actually have faith in them.
DOD00002080	I'm not saying this in an attempt to sway your opinions or choice of allegiance, mind you. I just think you should be aware of these things.
DOD00002081	Taking everything at face value is a fine way to get stabbed in the back by a blade you never saw coming. Keep it in mind.
DOD00002082	It isn't about getting rewarded. I support the NCR because it's protecting the people that need it.
DOD00002083	Well, you should have no worries on that front. They have no shortage of funds to pay those of us that do good work for them.
DOD00002084	The ideologies they espouse are irrelevant to us. What matters is that the metaphorical checks keep clearing.
DOD00002085	I respect your commitment to professionalism. Utilize your skills to walk a path you don't dislike, and reap the benefits.
DOD00002086	We have that in common. I believe we work well together, and perhaps our shared methodologies are the reason for that.
DOD00002087	Well, my curiosity is sated. Shall we move on?
DOD00002088	Goddamn right it's lucrative. They're going to owe me big once I win this war for them.
DOD00002089	Hmm. I suppose tailing you around is the only way I'd get to freely walk through Legion territory. Normally, stealth would be necessary.
DOD00002090	A few times. I've received many contracts from individuals in the NCR, and as you may imagine, many of those individuals despise the Legion.
DOD00002091	Naturally, the Legion isn't thrilled to have assassins from the west strolling through their lands and killing their people.
DOD00002092	And if that assassin happens to be female and incapable of breeding, why, I may well be asking for a machete to the skull.
DOD00002093	If I were seen. And that's the key.
DOD00002094	Have you been in Legion territory before?
DOD00002095	It's a side effect of my pleasant upbringing as a slave to raiders. I suppose I ought to be grateful that's the extent of my internal damage.
DOD00002096	It doesn't trouble me. I've no interest in bearing children. Even if I did, I somehow suspect that I'm not ideal parent material.
DOD00002097	When you say you're "incapable of breeding", what does that mean, exactly?
DOD00002098	I don't hate anything. I think the society the Legion wants to create is inherently incompatible with human nature, and needlessly sadistic.
DOD00002099	Common thought would dictate that my own experiences with slavery, and all its associated horrors, would have me despise the Legion on principle.
DOD00002100	But why should I extend the effort? What would it accomplish? My experiences were terrible, but that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
DOD00002101	It is what it is.
DOD00002102	And yet you don't seem to hate the Legion.
DOD00002103	Legionaries tend to be quite skilled at navigating the land. Crouching in a bush would get me shot, most likely.
DOD00002104	I mostly move at night, utilize distractions and diversions to keep attention focused away from my location, that sort of thing.
DOD00002105	Worth noting, when I say "Legion territory", I specifically mean the fringes. I've never been deep into Caesar's lands, nor would I ever wish to.
DOD00002106	Once the war is concluded, that will likely be the end of my dealings with the Legion. Who would bother paying me to kill them in peacetime?
DOD00002107	How do you sneak through Legion territory?
DOD00002108	Supposing I live long enough to retire one day, a place like this wouldn't be so bad.
DOD00002109	Eventually, perhaps. If nothing kills me first, I won't be able to do my job efficiently enough past a certain age.
DOD00002110	I'm not so foolish as to persist doing dangerous work that I can't keep up with. I don't need constant stimulation, either. Retirement would be fine.
DOD00002111	Preferably, somewhere cooler. Higher elevations suit me, as well. I'd swap the mutants for a lake, though.
DOD00002112	You don't have a profession, though, do you? You just do whatever drifts your way, wandering from place to place between missions, don't you?
DOD00002113	I'm curious. What will you do with yourself once this war over the dam is concluded?
DOD00002114	You see yourself retiring some day?
DOD00002115	Home is where you make it, I suppose. Unless the Legion were to take power, I would remain as well. Business is good here.
DOD00002116	Though "home" implies a connection deeper than just the place where you live or do business. Perhaps in time, it would come to me, too. Who knows?
DOD00002117	And you have that high-end luxury suite at the top of the tower on the Strip. Easy to stay put when you're treated so well, no doubt.
DOD00002118	The Mojave is my home. I'm not going anywhere.
DOD00002119	I can respect that. There's a great deal to see out in the world. I'd like to look out on the ocean one day, myself.
DOD00002120	I figure I'll just keep wandering.
DOD00002121	Well, there's a great deal of East to explore. Whether or not it's civilized beyond Arizona, I couldn't say.
DOD00002122	It would take extraordinary circumstances to push me beyond the Rockies. The further from civilization I go, the less need there is for my trade.
DOD00002123	I think I'll head east.
DOD00002124	I suppose that's one way to do it. Not everyone that excels at violence necessarily enjoys it. Many would be happy to hang up their guns for good.
DOD00002125	Me, I don't care. My days of trauma and degradation are behind me, and assassin work doesn't bother me in the slightest.
DOD00002126	I was thinking of settling down in California. No more war or uncertainty.
DOD00002127	Man, I fucking hate rich assholes that think their bank accounts put them above basic fucking morality. That's Burke, to a T.
DOD00002128	He has an important last name, he was born into wealth, he drinks fancy fucking wines while us regular people starve in the streets.
DOD00002129	And, yeah, I sold some of his documents to interested parties, but that don't mean I've got my hands in every data breach in the NCR!
DOD00002130	I'm getting fucking scapegoated, all 'cause I enjoy a little chemical relaxation here and there. I know he's the one pursuing the charges!
DOD00002131	Well, fuck him, and fuck his big fancy family dynasty. You make a habit of spitting on the little guy, eventually he's gonna get fed up. That's me.
DOD00002132	Why do you hate Senator Burke so much?
DOD00002133	Oh yeah? Well, don't keep me waiting, let me see what they have to say!
DOD00002134	...
DOD00002135	Shit, this is fucked up. But, damn if it ain't exactly the kinda dirt we were looking for.
DOD00002136	So, if I'm reading this right... The girls Massey saw get trucked to the Burke Estate... Were the ones that Gold was shipping in from out of state.
DOD00002137	And I bet if any of them decided to talk about what happened, then they'd get a visit from Winters. Oh yeah, I'm seeing the threads here.
DOD00002138	Well, alright then. Keep those testimonies on your pip-boy doohickey, and let me get a copy. Too many of these get out there, they can't cover it up.
DOD00002139	Alright. Deal's a deal. I'll see if I can get your buddy Blake to stick his head up. Whether or not he does, we got some serious shit on Burke.
DOD00002140	Now, looking at this, I don't think the reverend has clean hands... But, he don't seem as dirty as his cousin.
DOD00002141	Shove this in his face, I bet he'll talk to save his own ass. Might get even more dirt we can add to the pile, eh?
DOD00002142	Alright, you go speak with him. While you're doing that, I'll be setting up a meet with Blake. Good luck, chief. We're closing in on it, now.
DOD00002143	I got the accounts from Massey, Winters, and Gold.
DOD00002144	That's fucking great. But, I'm gonna need you to hold on to what you got for a bit longer. I'm still trying to get in contact with Blake.
DOD00002145	Come back later and we can really dive into this. In the meantime, I'm sure you got other jobs to take care of. No worries, I ain't going nowhere.
DOD00002146	I got the accounts from Massey, Winters, and Gold.
DOD00002147	Ah, now this is familiar, in all the worst ways. Throw in some torture and a bit of sexual abuse, and it'll be just like I was a child again.
DOD00002148	It's a dirty, blood-spattered pit, where the drug-addled dregs of humanity can entertain themselves by watching dumb animals gore one another.
DOD00002149	When they aren't eviscerating each other for the sport of their owners, the animals are kept locked up in tiny, dark cells.
DOD00002150	Substitute the animals with slave children, and there you go: It's a near-perfect recreation of my childhood.
DOD00002151	What do you mean?
DOD00002152	I don't know exactly. Somewhere to the south of the Mojave. Not so far that it wasn't desert, of course.
DOD00002153	I wasn't really in a sound state of mind as I was led north, so tracking landmarks didn't occur to me.
DOD00002154	Where was this?
DOD00002155	You're joking.
DOD00002156	...
DOD00002157	And the people of Westside honestly believe themselves to be the innocent victims of Fiend attacks?
DOD00002158	I'm not condoning the Fiends, mind you. They're cruel and sadistic as any other raider band. But their conflict with Westside seems... reciprocal.
DOD00002159	I don't like this place. I don't like what it stands for, and I don't like these... people.
DOD00002160	Oh, it's not just animals. Sometimes they throw captured Fiends into the arena, too.
DOD00002161	...I'm fine, thank you.
DOD00002162	I... Have taken great strides to leave my past firmly behind me. I train my mind to prevent it from conjuring up memories of that miserable time.
DOD00002163	Walking into a facsimile of the worst part of my life caught me off guard, that's all. I'm fine. What's done is done.
DOD00002164	Memories only hurt if you allow them to, and I'm no longer some wretched slave child.
DOD00002165	We'll leave when you're ready.
DOD00002166	You seem upset. Do you want us to leave?
DOD00002167	Take cover. Ambush!
DOD00002168	Carter. I run security here while Brecker is busy elsewhere. I've been just dying to make your acquaintance.
DOD00002169	Who are you?
DOD00002170	Oh, those nice folks? Yeah, we killed them all and threw their bodies down a drainage shaft.
DOD00002171	If their deaths bother you, well, it is your fault we had to neutralize them. You just couldn't leave well enough alone, eh? Good work.
DOD00002172	What happened to all the people that were here?
DOD00002173	I didn't kill the reverend; Brecker did. I just stood by and watched the old bastard as he got his throat cut open.
DOD00002174	Someone suspected he wasn't going to stand up to questioning, so why give him the chance to go singing something he shouldn't?
DOD00002175	Why did you kill the reverend?
DOD00002176	He's doing his job. Be thankful you're dealing with me, instead. I kill my enemies with bullets. Brecker has his own ways. Much slower ways.
DOD00002177	Where is Brecker?
DOD00002178	Funny, here I was about to say the same thing.
DOD00002179	<Attack> Shut up and die already.
DOD00002180	Ah hell, this one might be rough.
DOD00002181	What good timing, I was just thinking that big cross on the wall needed a corpse nailed to it.
DOD00002182	My security team operates in shifts. There's only ever a couple around here at any given time.
DOD00002183	The rest are close enough to respond in the event of an emergency. If I'm not around, my second, Carter, is. Security is tight.
DOD00002184	I don't see many security guards around here.
DOD00002185	No.
DOD00002186	I was paid to keep his business secure. When he became a liability, I was paid to silence him.
DOD00002187	Why kill the reverend? Didn't you work for him?
DOD00002188	You can go to your grave blind and ignorant. I piss on last requests.
DOD00002189	Who are you doing this for?
DOD00002190	Your bravado is repulsive. I'm going to enjoy eviscerating you.
DOD00002191	<Attack> Take your best shot, then.
DOD00002192	Yes.
DOD00002193	I'm the one that killed Caesar. You really think you can kill me?
DOD00002194	I suppose dignity was too much to expect of you. This may be an act of mercy, you inbred filth.
DOD00002195	All I see is a man wearing shades underground, bragging about how badass he is. Pathetic.
DOD00002196	Oh, really?
DOD00002197	Because I was just thinking I'd hang you with your own intestines. Maybe you can use your last moments to think of a more clever threat.
DOD00002198	I'm going to tear your heart out, you arrogant motherfucker.
DOD00002199	No reason for us to let our guards down, but... I think we've evaded the worst of it.
DOD00002200	Probably, yes. You seem surprised. I'm guessing... I don't strike you as religious, and so you wouldn't expect me to read a religious text, yes?
DOD00002201	I'm not religious, but I do make a habit of reading anything I get my hands on. Knowledge and information are their own rewards, I've found.
DOD00002202	No, religions hold no appeal to me. For one, they tend to codify morality into a uselessly strict good/evil dichotomy, which I don't find compelling.
DOD00002203	Moreover, I can't support the notion of an afterlife. It breeds complacency and apathy towards the lives we currently lead.
DOD00002204	After all, why should one struggle to improve their lives if it's all fleeting, soon to be replaced with a far more idyllic, permanent existence?
DOD00002205	Conversely, if one is already striving for an improved existence, the threat of failing to qualify for heaven could distract from their focus.
DOD00002206	After all, if everyone is focused solely on securing their place in a hypothetical afterlife, why should we bother trying to improve our reality?
DOD00002207	No. I believe our time on earth is fleeting, and it's up to each of us to imbue the time we have our own meaning, and live with the consequences.
DOD00002208	Did I see you reading a bible last time I told you to wait for me?
DOD00002209	Even if this stuff wasn't two centuries old, I'd still prefer water.
DOD00002210	This storage room hasn't been opened in 200 years? How is it that none of these prospective treasure hunters have ever heard of a drill?
DOD00002211	I already came to that conclusion years ago. It was an unexpected memory, not some sudden burst of renewed psychological trauma.
DOD00002212	We'll leave when you're ready for us to leave.
DOD00002213	You're not going to start whinging about the past, are you? It's over and done with. Relax.
DOD00002214	That has to be the loudest door I've ever encountered. If you want me to put those hinges out of their misery, say the word.
DOD00002215	And now we walk into Nellis. Tell me, do you have a list of impossible tasks you're checking off, or is this blind luck?
DOD00002216	You'll forgive my saying so, but that friend of yours, Eliza, seems disproportionately bitter for having lived such an idyllic life. It's annoying.
DOD00002217	Watch for Cazadors. Those loathsome creatures like to nest in these hills.
DOD00002218	Is Tully aware that the Legion like to stage ambushes from that spot right next to his business? Tell him to lay down some satchel charges next time.
DOD00002219	Those NCR merchants ought to find a new venue to hawk their wares. The Legion likes to stage ambushes from this bridge.
DOD00002220	...Oh.
DOD00002221	Most of these guys call me Three-Piece, but for brevity's sake, Kyle works just fine for me.
DOD00002222	Been in the Khans for pretty much my whole life, and if I have my way, I'll die for 'em too, when my time comes.
DOD00002223	Who are you?
DOD00002224	Not a super clever moniker, but I always got at least three locked and loaded pieces with me at any given time, so... Three-Piece Kyle. Sure.
DOD00002225	Why do they call you Three-Piece?
DOD00002226	Goes back a ways. It started with me saving his ass from getting curbstomped in a bar fight. Three-on-one odds didn't strike me as proper.
DOD00002227	Fight was going our way, when one of those cocksuckers pulled a switchblade and stabbed me in the fucking eye.
DOD00002228	He was going to finish me off, but Eddie came from behind and cut the guy's throat with a chunk of bottle.
DOD00002229	At that point, I was a little pissed, so I pulled my .45 and my .38 and put the other two assholes into the ground.
DOD00002230	Anyway, me and Eddie been tight since then. I keep telling him he oughtta join the Khans, but he doesn't fancy our initiation. Whatever.
DOD00002231	How'd you meet Eddie?
DOD00002232	Wait, what? What the fuck happened?!
DOD00002233	Eddie's dead, Kyle.
DOD00002234	The fuck...?
DOD00002235	...
DOD00002236	This is bullshit. Someone killed Eddie and forged this piece-of-shit letter.
DOD00002237	According to this note on his body, he killed himself.
DOD00002238	"To whomever finds this note... My name is Edward Hurst."
DOD00002239	That's how I know it's fake. His fucking name was Eddison Hurst.
DOD00002240	I know you two were sniffing around some conspiracy bullshit. Government cover ups and backroom deals. Normally, I don't buy into that shit, but...
DOD00002241	I guess you were onto something after all. You'd better watch your back. And if you find whoever killed Eddie... Gut 'em for me.
DOD00002242	How do you know it's fake?
DOD00002243	You really have no shortage of enemies. You should really consider doing your killing anonymously. This never happens to me, you know.
DOD00002244	Well, now that's frustrating.
DOD00002245	Ah, Jesus Christ... What... happened?
DOD00002246	I'm sorry, but your niece... She didn't make it.
DOD00002247	I... didn't know her all that well, truth be told. I know she didn't deserve this, though. Christ...
DOD00002248	I can't even be angry... I mean, you killed everyone responsible. All I can do... Is wish this all could have been different.
DOD00002249	Hell... Look, you don't need to tell Gerry 'bout this, okay? Maybe we ain't exactly close, but he's my brother, and he should hear it from me.
DOD00002250	Thanks for helping out. Wish it amounted to something.
DOD00002251	There was a lot of shady business going on in that church. She was killed as part of a coverup.
DOD00002252	Partner, you just described every day of my fucking life.
DOD00002253	That shit with Jessie... It's rough. I don't like kids getting hurt, and I don't like losing family. I just keep telling myself we did all we could.
DOD00002254	Something more than that bothering you?
DOD00002255	You ever feel like you did what was right, but it didn't accomplish anything in the end?
DOD00002256	I don't imagine that's easy. I can't say I've ever dealt with anything like that, but all the same, I know the feeling.
DOD00002257	I sink every extra cap I get into making things better around here, but it never feels like I succeed.
DOD00002258	I think... The important thing is that we keep trying. Things will never get better if we give up, right?
DOD00002259	For what it's worth, I think you deserve a drink and a smoke. We ain't great judges of our own merit, I think.
DOD00002260	Just try to keep your head up. Brighter days are coming. That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.
DOD00002261	<Tell O'Neill about the entire Burke Investigation>
DOD00002262	Yep, I know that feeling, too.
DOD00002263	If it helps, you've made things better around these parts. Even if I can't pay you, I can at least give you a drink and a smoke.
DOD00002264	Just try to keep your head up. Brighter days are coming. That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.
DOD00002265	I don't really want to go into details.
DOD00002266	This here is what we in the industry like to refer to as: "Cut content, motherfucker."
DOD00002267	You kill some truly fascinating people, don't you? Professionally, I'm almost envious.
DOD00002268	For a battered and generally-reviled tribe of insular outlaws, the Great Khans have some genuinely high-end weapons. Someone must be supplying them.
DOD00002269	I'm not so well-versed in wilderness survival. I rarely stray far from population centers, so you'll forgive my lack of tactical insight.
DOD00002270	I don't understand tribalism. Isolating themselves hasn't given them any greater insight into life. They're no more moral than anyone else.
DOD00002271	Pacifism truly is the most asinine ideology. "Feel free to shoot me and loot my corpse. I'm willfully defenseless, and that makes me a good person."
DOD00002272	Once, it had purpose and potential, unfettered, flying as its pilot willed. Now, it's a broken deathtrap.  So allegorical.
DOD00002273	I... Believe I was born in a place like this. A little collection of shacks and shanties, with slavers always rooting about.
DOD00002274	That's what the slaver that bought me from my parents said, anyway. I wasn't even a year old. I have no memories, just his claims.
DOD00002275	No. I don't remember where I was born. The one man who could've told me is long dead. And what would even be the point?
DOD00002276	Even if I somehow found it and returned... Why would I do this? To ask my parents why they sold me? I know why they sold me. Profit.
DOD00002277	Besides... So many people become obsessed with the past. Some great wrong that was done to them, a mistake they made, an insight they lacked...
DOD00002278	For what? It's only by moving on that a person can grow. Become more than what they were... What happened to me was unpleasant... But it's over now.
DOD00002279	Surely that's victory enough. It has to be. I'm free, and I alone can dictate the meaning of my life. It is what it is. No more, no less.
DOD00002280	Would you like us to try and find where you came from?
DOD00002281	No... It wouldn't accomplish anything. It wouldn't bring me back to a time before I was chattel. It wouldn't fill some void in my life.
DOD00002282	Do they deserve to die for what they did to me? Perhaps. Who am I to say? Many would say I deserve to die, for my own actions.
DOD00002283	That's not to say I forgive them, or what they did. If I learned they burned alive in some raider attack, I wouldn't care at all.
DOD00002284	In fact, I truly hope they are dead. I hope they died shortly after selling me. But if they didn't, what purpose would killing them now serve?
DOD00002285	The wrong they committed against me happened over two decades ago. I don't want to be the sort of person who seethes for that long over anything.
DOD00002286	Do you want revenge?
DOD00002287	He did. He named me, taught me to walk, speak, read.
DOD00002288	He also had me flogged if I hesitated at all when he gave me an order. If I made a move out of turn, I was whipped bloody.
DOD00002289	He taught me that I was property, not a person. That I must be obedient and quiet. If I failed a task, I was locked in a crate to starve for the day.
DOD00002290	He told me that when I was purchased, it would almost certainly be for the sexual pleasure of whomever could afford me. And I was.
DOD00002291	I was in my early adolescence when someone was actually kind to me for the first time in my life. The first time I was acknowledged as a person.
DOD00002292	You understand, I hope, why it is that I have no desire to dwell on my own past. Why I would never want to go back and find where it all began.
DOD00002293	If you were sold that young, the slaver must have done more to raise you than your parents did.
DOD00002294	There are. I learned them well. The most important of them was the knowledge of what I could endure and overcome.
DOD00002295	That's far more useful knowledge than the location of whichever rat-shit shantytown I was unfortunate enough to enter the world into, surely.
DOD00002296	And on the subject of rat-shit shantytowns, this one lost its luster the moment we walked in. Shall we get moving?
DOD00002297	There are lessons in the past, though.
DOD00002298	Is that meant to get under my skin? Because it's a sentiment I fully agree with.
DOD00002299	I'm well over it. I leave the past where it lays. I think people may not be so miserable all the time if they did the same.
DOD00002300	In that spirit, let's get moving. No sense loitering around some ruined old shantytown when we have better things to do, surely.
DOD00002301	Whatever. Boo-hoo, life is hard for everyone. Get over it.
DOD00002302	Ah, but you're forgetting my complete lack of feelings in that regard. In order to feel better, surely I would already have to feel bad by default.
DOD00002303	I mostly just feel numb to it all. Vengeance wouldn't change that, for better or worse.
DOD00002304	Yeah, but revenge is cathartic. It might make you feel better.
DOD00002305	Dealing with Ulysses has been rather irritating. I look forward to being done with this place.
DOD00002306	I don't appreciate having my time wasted, and if somebody must try to kill me, or you, the least they could do is have a reason that makes sense.
DOD00002307	No, I don't care enough about him, or his ridiculous motivations, to actually exert the effort to dislike him. But I can be annoyed, sure.
DOD00002308	Clearly he's a homicidal lunatic with aspirations of mass-murder, but he pretends as if it's a normal reaction to you... existing.
DOD00002309	You served as the method conveyance for the destruction of this settlement he fetishized, so somehow wildly launching nukes is the logical response?
DOD00002310	I'm surprised you have an opinion on this. I thought you don't bother disliking things or people?
DOD00002311	Hmm? No. I don't think so. I think he employs a very flowery, melodramatic affectation that lends him the illusion of competence.
DOD00002312	The man seems to be under the impression that you, a courier, making repeat stops to a burgeoning settlement with urgent need of deliveries....
DOD00002313	...Is in some way a deeply symbolic gesture of your strange, idealized affection for the location. He's clearly projecting. And delusional.
DOD00002314	I don't think it's that simple. He seems fairly smart.
DOD00002315	...Perhaps. I feel it necessary to point out that I've also been traumatized, but I didn't choose to cope by launching ICBMs into population centers.
DOD00002316	I think it would be simpler to just kill him, but, as always, I am at your command.
DOD00002317	It's not logical, but he's clearly traumatized by what happened. I think I can reason with him.
DOD00002318	That does seem to be the simplest solution to raving madmen, doesn't it? I suppose we ought to get to work, then.
DOD00002319	Yeah, I've had more than enough of him. He's a dead man.
DOD00002320	I don't think our mannerisms are really very comparable. For one, I don't speak in sentence fragments, like someone went at my words with an eraser.
DOD00002321	I use a variety of advanced words because... Well, they exist, and I know how to string a proper sentence together with them, so why not?
DOD00002322	This one though, prefers to use some bizarre, monosyllabic syntax to obfuscate how petty his goals truly are.
DOD00002323	"I'm angry that this settlement I wanted to live in exploded, and now I'm throwing a homicidal tantrum" is a touch harder to rationalize.
DOD00002324	Also, his insistence on referring to the regional factions solely by their iconography was wearing thin by the third time he did it.
DOD00002325	As if a man that fetishizes the flag of some dead nation, that he was never even part of, is some sort of expert on the meanings behind symbols.
DOD00002326	Are you seriously giving him shit for his speech? You talk like a thesaurus, Charlie.
DOD00002327	I'm picturing... A man bent over backwards, his head wedged firmly up his own ass.
DOD00002328	What kind of symbol do you think would fit him better?
DOD00002329	My goal is to kill anyone that may wish to kill you, up until the terms of my contract end.
DOD00002330	That's it. I'm not haunted by some lingering threads of the past that I've yet to tie up, or anything to that effect.
DOD00002331	I have a handful of low-priority side jobs at the moment, that I figured I would deal with during any breaks where I'm not shadowing you.
DOD00002332	Do you have any goals?
DOD00002333	I prefer high-accuracy, suppressed firearms, ideally with a high rate of fire. I'm also quite handy with a blade.
DOD00002334	I'm perfectly capable of holding my own in combat from any distance. I consider stealth to be my speciality, however.
DOD00002335	Striking unsuspecting targets and maximizing lethality in that first move is my preferred methodology. I can assist if you utilize similar tactics.
DOD00002336	I do not, however, have much in the way of training in the usage of explosives, energy weapons, or hand-to-hand combat.
DOD00002337	How can I best use your skills?
DOD00002338	...Sure, I don't see why not. I can split the commission with you for each target. That's fair enough, certainly.
DOD00002339	I'll need to be present when you kill the targets, mind you. While I'm aware you're an experienced killer, they are still my contracts.
DOD00002340	The details are in my safehouse. As my clients told me, there's no rush. I wouldn't be bothered if we didn't get around to any of these.
DOD00002341	Side jobs, huh? Could I help with any of those?
DOD00002342	No, you won't have to worry about that. I specifically accepted these side contracts because the clients aren't in any sort of rush.
DOD00002343	It's something to keep myself busy in the event that you don't require me to keep within close proximity to you, 24/7.
DOD00002344	Well, as long as it doesn't distract you from your duties with me.
DOD00002345	This target should be simple enough. Apparently he's totally alone.
DOD00002346	I was told that this one killed the last assassin to come after him. He won't fare so well this time.
DOD00002347	This target should be soft enough, but he'll likely be accompanied by some of his chem-addict clientele.
DOD00002348	A lieutenant in the Jackals. Shocking that a member of that worthless gang even managed to earn a price on his head.
DOD00002349	Time to get to work.
DOD00002350	This is the final one of my side jobs. He'll be well-equipped, but nothing beyond our abilities. Let's get to work.
DOD00002351	Fine work.
DOD00002352	Mission accomplished. Time to get paid.
DOD00002353	That should satisfy my client.
DOD00002354	That one won't be bothering anyone again.
DOD00002355	Job's done. We should probably leave before the sheriff takes objection to assassins operating in his jurisdiction.
DOD00002356	That's somebody's problem solved. Good work.
DOD00002357	Alright. That was the last of my side contracts. I appreciate your assistance.
DOD00002358	Once, a job required me to wait three days at a sniper's nest, never moving, just waiting for my target to walk by his window and into my sights.
DOD00002359	A... refugee camp? That's what they're calling it? Why not be more honest? Call it what it is: A camp for the shiftless and impoverished.
DOD00002360	It's a breeding ground for a collective narrative of self-victimization. Ridiculous.
DOD00002361	I mean that these people idle around this derelict collection of ruins, all day, every day, doing nothing to improve their miserable lives.
DOD00002362	They complain about how they're destitute, blaming the institution of gambling for their woes, conveniently ignoring that gambling was their choice.
DOD00002363	If they're really so desperate, why don't they actually do something to ease their financial woes?
DOD00002364	Look at this place. It's filthy. Maybe one of them should consider picking up the trash in exchange for a small fee. But they don't.
DOD00002365	They sit in their refuse piles, shaking their fists at the sky and demanding that reality rewrite itself in their favor.
DOD00002366	What do you mean?
DOD00002367	Fine.
DOD00002368	They faced actual hardship in their pasts. What did they learn from it? How are they rising above it?
DOD00002369	They're content to hide under the thumb of the NCR, so why not pick up a rifle? Use their righteous indignation for the benefit of their new nation?
DOD00002370	They were the victims of the war. Now, they're just squatting in piles of rubble and filth, trading stories of how things used to be.
DOD00002371	Glamorizing some past life that was stolen from them, while doing nothing to regain it, or start anew. Self-victimization.
DOD00002372	Not everyone living here is a degenerate gambler. There are war refugees here, too.
DOD00002373	Indeed. And they've received help. Rather than landing in a ditch with a knife in their guts, the NCR provided them with shelter and medical aid.
DOD00002374	And now, they're in a state fit to begin climbing out of the hole that life has dumped them in. But they refuse.
DOD00002375	They'd rather wallow in this pit and wait for a solution to appear before them, served on a golden platter, held aloft by glittering angels.
DOD00002376	Anything less than that would just be too much work for them. Such a choice warrants these loathsome conditions they're confined to.
DOD00002377	Myself, I'd rather leave this place as soon as our business permits. Shall we get to it?
DOD00002378	Everyone needs help sometimes, Charlie.
DOD00002379	It's truly impressive what people can endure, survive, and overcome. I've had first-hand experience with that... resilience of spirit.
DOD00002380	The path isn't easy. It will likely leave scars, mental or physical. But it's never impossible.
DOD00002381	These dregs wallow in their own misery, often self-inflicted, and make the conscious choice to stay in this filth-smeared purgatory.
DOD00002382	They're free to make that ridiculous choice, of course. Just as I am free to find them utterly repulsive because of it.
DOD00002383	Let's attend to our business here, and go.
DOD00002384	Why does this bother you so much?
DOD00002385	Nor can I. Let's get out of this wretched place.
DOD00002386	I can't say I really care about any of them.
DOD00002387	Heading for Searchlight, are we? Feral Ghouls are fragile enough. As for the radiation... Here, this may help.
DOD00002388	Course he told me. After I finished spitting on his boots, he told me about her. Fuck...
DOD00002389	The fuck did she ever do to anyone? Why the fuck is she gone, and I'm still fucking here?
DOD00002390	Please... Just leave me alone.
DOD00002391	So, has Ryan talked to you about Jessie...?
DOD00002392	Hmm? Sometimes I see things in my periphery, and I need to reorient my thoughts. Shut out the metaphysical white noise.
DOD00002393	You know, sometimes you just stare blankly off into space. You feeling okay?
DOD00002394	I suppose that's accurate enough. It's nothing delusional; I can always tell what's real. It's... hard to describe.
DOD00002395	It's chemical. Neural damage. I spent... many years, being pumped full of every sort of narcotic under the sun.
DOD00002396	I'm used to it. I can go days without experiencing it, and when it does come up, it's a minor distraction, at the very worst.
DOD00002397	It's never compromised my effectiveness. I wouldn't allow for that.
DOD00002398	Wait, are you saying you hallucinate things?
DOD00002399	Eh. I'm used to it. It doesn't detract from my professional efficacy, so it's not really something I'm overly concerned about.
DOD00002400	Ooookay. That's weird.
DOD00002401	This is the emptiest town I've ever seen. Like it just rose up from the sand, half-formed, out of some child's interpretive drawing of civilization.
DOD00002402	A military outpost dedicated to observing nothing at all... That sounds like a flowery metaphor straight from some anti-expansionist manifesto.
DOD00002403	He's going to kill himself. Might not be today. Or tomorrow. But soon. He crossed that threshold, and he lacks the constitution to pull himself back.
DOD00002404	Yep. That I did. It never really bothered me none, I figured, we're all going to die some day. Heh. Life has a way of collecting on those debts.
DOD00002405	Took my own innocent boy getting himself killed for me to realize what sorta man I was. Still am, I guess. I can't take none of it back.
DOD00002406	Like I said. Take on a debt like that, one way or another, it's gonna come back to bite you in the ass. Always does. Keep that in mind, kid.
DOD00002407	It sounds like you killed a lot of innocent people.
DOD00002408	<Holotape Recording>
DOD00002409	A... music holotape? What am I meant to do with this? I'm not so good at murder that I could use it as a weapon, you know.
DOD00002410	Would you be interested in this weird holotape I found? It has music on it, apparently.
DOD00002411	I... did say that, yes. I suppose I'm just surprised you bothered to internalize that bit of worthless personal trivia.
DOD00002412	...
DOD00002413	I... don't suppose there's anything wrong in enjoying myself from time to time.
DOD00002414	Thank you, truly.
DOD00002415	You said you liked the sort of music they don't play on the radio, so I thought you'd enjoy this.
DOD00002416	I apologize. I'm not really used to being the recipient of random acts of kindness. I didn't mean to insult your efforts.
DOD00002417	So... Yes, thank you. Truly. I appreciate that you kept my personal foibles in mind, for whatever reason.
DOD00002418	You said you liked music; I got you music. This is the part where you're supposed to thank me.
DOD00002419	Right.
DOD00002420	I don't have any more questions.
