AAD00100001	GREETING
AAD00100002	Howdy pardner! Welcome to the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum.
AAD00100003	A tribe called the Great Khans has joined us. They'd better be good fighters.
AAD00100004	Thank goodness you're here. My squad needs help.
AAD00100005	Got some fresh grub coming in from Goodsprings.
AAD00100006	You shouldn't have crossed the Powder Gangers! Now you're going to pay!
AAD00100007	I have a present for you from the Powder Gangers... I hope you like dynamite!
AAD00100008	You'll pay for what you did to the Powder Gangers!
AAD00100009	Nobody screws with the Powder Gangers and lives!
AAD00100010	Here he is, boys! Let's show him what happens when you cross the Powder Gangers!
AAD00100011	A pleasure to meet you! I'm Dr. Thomas Hildern, Director of Operations, OSI East. I presume you're here about Vault 22?
AAD00100012	This is a restricted area. Step away immediately.
AAD00100013	<groan>
AAD00100014	<grunt>
AAD00100015	Fiends... cracked-out junkies. All those chems make them a real bitch to take down.
AAD00100016	You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
AAD00100017	You're not part of my unit... no, you're here for the money! I told the Omertas I was good for it!
AAD00100018	Gotta wonder what the hell a civilian is doing here.
AAD00100019	You from Camp Golf or McCarran? Never mind. Don't really care.
AAD00100020	Damn muties. Wasteland is better off without 'em.
AAD00100021	Can't wait to get the rest of our pay for this job.
AAD00100022	Wish the muties would make a move. Getting sick of waiting.
AAD00100023	It's much cooler up here. I love it.
AAD00100024	Muties aren't so tough if you've got the firepower.
AAD00100025	I can't believe it. Caesar's Legion attacks in force, and I actually survived!
AAD00100026	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
AAD00100027	You're a crazy son of a bitch, you hear me! The Tops!? Ha! Crazy.
AAD00100028	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
AAD00100029	Yeah I saw Benny running through here! He had the fear of the devil in him!
AAD00100030	You killed ol' cheeser!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
AAD00100031	Cheeser's dead!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
AAD00100032	There are many good things in life, but peeing is definitely the best.
AAD00100033	Hey! Don't poke me!
AAD00100034	Ow! Why are you poking me!
AAD00100035	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
AAD00100036	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
AAD00100037	Go bother someone else.
AAD00100038	A man is never drunk if he can lie on the floor without holding on.
AAD00100039	Woooooo!
AAD00100040	Where'd The Kings go?
AAD00100041	Hey doc! You got any Fixer?! I've got a bender planned that would make a hobo cry.
AAD00100042	I think your friend wants to eat me! Please don't let him!
AAD00100043	Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful busty brahmin riding a caravaneer off into the sunset... Wait I don't think that came out right.
AAD00100044	I'll give you five caps for the robot!
AAD00100045	Your ghoul friend looks shifty. Watch your pockets, buddy!
AAD00100046	What happened to your buddy's face?
AAD00100047	I am not an alcoholic, sir. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
AAD00100048	I am not an alcoholic, ma'am. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
AAD00100049	The problem with some people is when they're not drunk, they're sober.
AAD00100050	People ask me how much it takes me to get drunk. I don't know. I usually can't remember numbers, let alone where I am the next morning.
AAD00100051	Hey! Watch your back! There be a pack of ol' ladies runnin' round here somewhere! Don't let them catch you unawares!
AAD00100052	What the fuck just happened?
AAD00100053	The Caesar has marked you for death... and the Legion obeys. Ready yourself for battle.
AAD00100054	Now you will serve as an example to all who dare oppose Caesar's Legion. Defend yourself!
AAD00100055	You have defied Caesar for the last time! Your life ends now!
AAD00100056	Oh, thank God! I didn't think I'd ever see another human face down here.
AAD00100057	Please, buddy, you've got to help me. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last with my leg like this.
AAD00100058	Come on man, my leg is killing me.
AAD00100059	Is it safe to leave yet?
AAD00100060	You come to the wrong place, traveler. Primm's dying. If you got any sense, you'll be moving on.
AAD00100061	Quite a town we got here. Sheriff gets murdered, and Deputy Beagle dragged off for ransom to the Bison Steve. That should bring back the tourists.
AAD00100062	Rather be left alone to my misery, if you don't mind.
AAD00100063	Before the Powder Gangers came to town, Johnson Nash ran the local store and the Mojave Express station.
AAD00100064	Hoi! White Legs don't leave survivors often. You're some kind of lucky, let me tell you.
AAD00100065	You came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
AAD00100066	Hoi! What you doing? There's still White Legs back there!
AAD00100067	Wait - you came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
AAD00100068	Yah ah tahg! I saw you at the southern passage - you... um... you do know there were still White Legs alive when you ran off, right?
AAD00100069	Hello. I'm Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
AAD00100070	Any word on Station Charlie?
AAD00100071	Well howdy, pardner! Good to see you again. Boss is waiting for ya upstairs, so get a move on!
AAD00100072	Die, NCR filth!
AAD00100073	Thank you for your advice. You've helped me see more clearly.
AAD00100074	If it isn't the courier who's done everything he can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
AAD00100075	If it isn't the courier who's done everything she can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
AAD00100076	The Legion holds Nelson, Profligate! This is where you'll die. Brothers, attack!
AAD00100077	Dammit, I didn't want you to kill him, just find me some evidence!
AAD00100078	Sorry, friend, you've crossed the NCR one too many times - you've been marked for death... and we're here to take care of that.
AAD00100079	Nothing personal - orders - you know how it is. Well, let's get to it.
AAD00100080	We should have given you a better welcome on your first visit to Zion, but from what I hear, the White Legs beat us to it.
AAD00100081	White Legs seem to be the only visitors we have these days, and I wouldn't have expected anyone from the Mojave to come looking for us.
AAD00100082	And you're a courier, no less. Not the one I was expecting, but I suppose he wouldn't have come with a caravan.
AAD00100083	I don't know if you were close to the other members of your group, but you have my sympathy.
AAD00100084	I pray for the safety of all good people who come to Zion, even Gentiles, but we can't expect God to do all the work.
AAD00100085	You made it. Good. I'm getting tired of waiting for you - and Elijah. Surprised? Yeah... I made it here, just like you did.
AAD00100086	You made it. Good... <Coughs> ugh... Hurts to talk. I'll keep this quick in case my... voice goes out.
AAD00100087	Well, now, if it isn't my ball, chain, and dog collar rolled all into one.
AAD00100088	You have that sad, questioning look in your eye. Not sure talking to me's going to make it any better.
AAD00100089	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
AAD00100090	I hear you took care of Motor-Runner. I could have handled that on my own.
AAD00100091	Thanks for the help back at Vault 3. I couldn't have gotten out of there without the assist.
AAD00100092	What do you need? I have a job to do.
AAD00100093	I'm ready to take out Motor-Runner when you are.
AAD00100094	How the hell did you get in here? And who the hell are you?
AAD00100095	What are you doing here, soldier? I didn't call for any support.
AAD00100096	Rick is dead, but I'd still welcome my freedom!
AAD00100097	Are you going to free me or what?
AAD00100098	What the fuck are you doing here?
AAD00100099	Man, are you turned around. Motor-Runner is on the other side of the complex.
AAD00100100	Sorry, but I don't have time to talk right now. I'm going back to the ranch.
AAD00100101	Stupid Bighorners were making noise all night again.
AAD00100102	I like it up here. Nice and cool.
AAD00100103	Better watch out. Lily's been babbling about her grandkids again.
AAD00100104	Some days, I miss being in the Master's army.
AAD00100105	Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
AAD00100106	Howdy. Something I could help you with?
AAD00100107	You showed up just in time to say goodbye. Me and a couple of the others are packing it in and heading back to California.
AAD00100108	The water ration's still a problem, and the NCR doesn't look like it's going to do anything about it anytime soon.
AAD00100109	Something else you need before I go?
AAD00100110	There's too much light. Why is there always too much light?
AAD00100111	Have you heard the news? Caesar's agents assassinated President Kimball - it'll be war for sure, now.
AAD00100112	Have you found out what happened to those missing refugees?
AAD00100113	Good to see you - something else I can do for you?
AAD00100114	Back again? What can I do for you?
AAD00100115	You're back. Have you changed your mind about helping out?
AAD00100116	First Recon is a top-notch unit. They're always buying sniper rifles from us.
AAD00100117	That Eyebot looks like it's gone through hell.
AAD00100118	I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
AAD00100119	I've never seen a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
AAD00100120	Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
AAD00100121	Demand for Gun Runner weapons is high, so don't expect them to stay in stock for very long.
AAD00100122	Well, well, it looks like we've cleared them out, damn inbred mutant freaks. Think I'll start heading back to California now.
AAD00100123	There have been way too many catastrophic NCR foul-ups around here for me to risk my life by sticking around.
AAD00100124	You'll get the hang of that takedown. I had trouble learning it at first, too.
AAD00100125	What's new?
AAD00100126	Find anything?
AAD00100127	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
AAD00100128	I don't remember getting informed about any new transfers to this post.
AAD00100129	This is a military post. You sure you're in the right place?
AAD00100130	Is there something you need from me?
AAD00100131	You hear some crumb tried to kill the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
AAD00100132	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny.
AAD00100133	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
AAD00100134	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
AAD00100135	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
AAD00100136	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a fink all along.
AAD00100137	You hear some crazy crumb killed the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
AAD00100138	Baby, you couldn't pay me enough to step off the Strip these days. Legion cats are out there thick as fleas on a dog, and they ain't no bums, neither.
AAD00100139	House selling out to the NCR? Who woulda figured him for a fink?
AAD00100140	No run-ins with the Great Khans, I hope? They've been more restless than usual.
AAD00100141	This area isn't safe for civilians. You don't want to get caught by the Great Khans.

AAD00100199	You're not a part of this post as far as I know. What do you want?
AAD00100200	You looking to join the Kings?
AAD00100201	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
AAD00100202	You hear how Mr. House said "uncle?" Vegas is gonna join the NCR. So much for Freeside.
AAD00100203	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
AAD00100204	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
AAD00100205	Heya Rex, how you doing boy?
AAD00100206	I see you've hired a Follower doctor. Smart move, Freeside being what it is.
AAD00100207	That friend of yours NCR? He looks like he's NCR.
AAD00100208	Hellooo, cowgirl! You mind if I talk to your lady friend a bit instead of you?
AAD00100209	Huh. Nice robot. You with the Followers or something?
AAD00100210	Whoa. That's a whole lotta mutant you got with you there. Still, long as it doesn't cause trouble it's all good.
AAD00100211	Nice to see a human palling around with a ghoul. I see a lot of people around here avoid them.
AAD00100212	Your girl's kinda cute, but not my type at all. I don't go for smart chicks.
AAD00100213	What the hell? You're that courier Benny wasted back in Goodsprings. You're supposed to be dead.
AAD00100214	I'm getting real tired of talking.
AAD00100215	How are the negotiations with the Great Khans going?
AAD00100216	The Great Khans can go, just as we agreed.
AAD00100217	Thanks for getting both of my people out of there.
AAD00100218	I'm sorry that you couldn't get both hostages out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
AAD00100219	I'm sorry you couldn't get either hostage out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
AAD00100220	I really don't have time to chatter right now.
AAD00100221	Dawes said he let somebody in. So, you going to give me a reason not to kill you and throw your body back outside?
AAD00100222	You're the one Cobb mentioned. Maybe you feel like helping us out around here.
AAD00100223	I've been thinking that since you've been good to us, we can be good to you.
AAD00100224	We've got plenty of spare powder and dynamite around. Say the word and we can give you some of it every couple days.
AAD00100225	Hey, I've been sent to tell you that, while you're not exactly a friend, we know you've helped us out some all the same.
AAD00100226	We figure some kind of truce is in order. As long as you don't come too close to any of our camps, we'll let you pass without trying to kill you.
AAD00100227	Of course, the truce is off once we know you're an enemy.
AAD00100228	Got nothing else to say to you.
AAD00100229	What the hell are you doing here? Civilians shouldn't be here.
AAD00100230	You should go topside.
AAD00100231	Hello there! Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company. How can I help you today?
AAD00100232	I hope you're not planning on visiting the Strip.
AAD00100233	Humph... I see a lot of folks come and go, but none fit your type. Where you come from, stranger?
AAD00100234	You again? Get outta here, smoothface.
AAD00100235	What... what have I done!? Mother...
AAD00100236	NCR, no better than common thieves. Where do they get off stealing our armor?
AAD00100237	Caesar on the cross, been a long time since I've seen the kind of work you've laid down today... a damn long time.
AAD00100238	And the screams of those Legion bastards as they kicked dirt running East... like a choir of angels to my ears.
AAD00100239	Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb of God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
AAD00100240	Could use a hundred of you, just scatter you over the East like jacks, give those plumed fucks the what-for.
AAD00100241	As if I didn't have enough to worry about, one of our facilities was recently broken into and its power diverted.
AAD00100242	Have you seen that damned tower in the Strip, all aglow? Of course you've seen it. Everyone's seen it.
AAD00100243	That was our power that did that, and I will find out who did it. Did you have something to report?
AAD00100244	Have you discovered what the Omertas are up to?
AAD00100245	An envoy of Vegas, yet you carry yourself for battle. If so, you cannot *truly* be of that city of cowards.
AAD00100246	And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the Bear, yet you are ready for battle.
AAD00100247	What is this Brahmin shit? I'm not getting the feeling we're all about to sing kumbaya here.
AAD00100248	Should have known, Greeks and gifts. That, and next time, shoot the messenger.
AAD00100249	I think those Nightkin are going to cause a lot of trouble, but I guess giving them the specs was better than killing them.
AAD00100250	I did get a lot of useful data from the experiment, and I'm much closer to a cure than I was before.
AAD00100251	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
AAD00100252	Hi there. Welcome to the Westside Co-op. I'm Clayton Etienne. Let me know if you have any questions.
AAD00100253	Welcome back. How can I help you?
AAD00100254	Uh... hi.
AAD00100255	Cooke left the vault, good thing too, he was going to get us all killed.
AAD00100256	Cooke is going to get us all killed.
AAD00100257	Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
AAD00100258	Hadn't heard there were women Powder Gangers, but a bounty's a bounty. The NCR will probably pay up either way.
AAD00100259	Greetings! Pardon my enthusiasm. I'm not accustomed to meeting so many new people, but I find you fascinating.
AAD00100260	I've tried to learn as much as possible about the surface world since our community left our home.
AAD00100261	Hello again, outlander.
AAD00100262	Why are the outlanders killing each other? Why do they treat us like machines? I wish we had remained in the safety, and sanity, of our Vault.
AAD00100263	Hello, outlander.
AAD00100264	It's good making your acquaintance.
AAD00100265	Excuse me, I'm... not from around here.
AAD00100266	Horowitz is our leader.
AAD00100267	You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
AAD00100268	I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
AAD00100269	I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
AAD00100270	We're in your debt. Thank you, outlander.
AAD00100271	I wish we were back at our Vault.
AAD00100272	The surface world is a cruel place.
AAD00100273	Why are you people treating us like this?
AAD00100274	We're heading back home. I hope our troops do the same. This land can't be saved.
AAD00100275	Trying to grow crops in this heat, with so little water, is bad enough, but now we've got radiation seeping into the farmlands east of New Vegas.
AAD00100276	We're done. Let the people of this hell-hole deal with their problems, I say.
AAD00100277	I'm kind of busy, what do you want?
AAD00100278	If you're looking for Ambassador Crocker, he's not here. He was removed from office and sent home.
AAD00100279	I guess they disagreed with how he handled some of the events out here. It's unfortunate. He was a good man.
AAD00100280	Keep your nose clean on the Strip, soldier.
AAD00100281	Aren't you the guy that was shooting up The Tops?
AAD00100282	Guess you must have some special deal with House to be able to do that and not get in trouble.
AAD00100283	Holy shit, did you hear about the Monorail being destroyed? How the fuck did that happen?
AAD00100284	I'm just glad to be safe over here on the Strip.
AAD00100285	I don't want any trouble, mister. What do you want?
AAD00100286	Don't miss The Lonesome Drifter, LIVE at the Aces Theater!
AAD00100287	Songs so sad and lonesome, audience members of the opposite sex will be fighting over who gets to go back to your room with you - guaranteed!
AAD00100288	Ready to tap your toes and snap your fingers? Don't miss Bruce Isaac, LIVE at the Ace Theater!
AAD00100289	It's good to see such an outstanding citizen of the NCR. What can I do for you, my friend?
AAD00100290	I bet it feels real nice to be carrying those weapons around on the Strip.
AAD00100291	That damn Mr. House has forbid any NCR military personnel from carrying any sort of firearms on the Strip. Well, except for Captain Pappas.
AAD00100292	Mr. House still doesn't trust the NCR. A word of advice, the Securitrons won't put up with any funny stuff out there, so don't do anything stupid.
AAD00100293	This your first time on the Strip?
AAD00100294	Hello. Did you need something?
AAD00100295	What do you want?
AAD00100296	Don't talk to me, rookie!
AAD00100297	They're all dead. Guy must've had some kind of explosive on him, set off all the ordnance in this place at once.
AAD00100298	Congratulations, rookie. You just cost me my job. Don't think I don't appreciate it.
AAD00100299	I was just telling Gloria about your performance. Hell of a first day, huh?
AAD00100300	As I live and breathe, Rose of Sharon Cassidy. The late Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Was hoping you were on that caravan I massacred, but...
AAD00100301	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, and we're shutting you down for good.
AAD00100302	Ah, just the person I was looking for. Your name came up in a discussion we had recently.
AAD00100303	My sister is very impressed with you so far, but I'm not. I don't think you have what it takes to work for this family.
AAD00100304	Luckily for you, I'm going to give you the chance to prove me wrong. What do you say? Want to make some real money?
AAD00100305	Well, looks like you came through after all. She's not half bad looking, is she? It's almost a shame...
AAD00100306	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, we're shutting you down for good.
AAD00100307	I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is on your hands.
AAD00100308	It is a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience with Caesar.
AAD00100309	You've proven yourself to be a true friend of the Legion. We have a safehouse available to our agents in the Mojave - here's the key.
AAD00100310	It's an excellent place to rest and store extra equipment. In addition, one of our veterans, Atticus, visits the house every few days.
AAD00100311	While he's there, you can acquire items useful for stealthy operations against our enemies from him.
AAD00100312	The mechanical dog you have with you - where did you get it?
AAD00100313	A woman actually proved useful for once. Caesar was bold to put his life in your hands.
AAD00100314	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He appreciates your service, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
AAD00100315	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
AAD00100316	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
AAD00100317	Any crimes you may have perpetrated against the Legion are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy a second time.
AAD00100318	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
AAD00100319	You may go.
AAD00100320	Let's get going, we have a battle to win.
AAD00100321	If I had any idea Moreno was capable of doing something like that, I'd have warned you. I'm sorry it played out like this.
AAD00100322	I'm not sure helping the Legion is the right idea. But, I'm going along with it.
AAD00100323	Keep your head down - could be snipers around.
AAD00100324	We're watching you... stranger!
AAD00100325	Don't fuck with the caged beasts.
AAD00100326	Follow the rules of The Thorn.
AAD00100327	Don't feed the creatures.
AAD00100328	Nowhere else will you find something like The Thorn.
AAD00100329	Take advice. Don't break the rules. And we won't kill you.
AAD00100330	Come to see the fights, or Red Lucy?
AAD00100331	Enjoy the show, and don't give us a reason to shoot you, okay?
AAD00100332	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball was struck down in a cowardly attack at Hoover Dam.
AAD00100333	The Strip offers many fine cocktail lounges where grieving persons may drown their sorrows.
AAD00100334	Thanks for freeing the deputy. A bit, anyway.
AAD00100335	Thanks for freeing Deputy Beagle. He's better than nothing. Maybe.
AAD00100336	I hear you're going to help find Primm a new sheriff. Mighty kind of you to take an interest.
AAD00100337	So you're the one's going to bring the law back to Primm? I'll believe it when I see it.
AAD00100338	Thanks for bringing the NCR to town, stranger. Things're finally looking up for Primm.
AAD00100339	Thanks to you I got a mess of soldiers watching every move I make, plus I got to pay taxes for the privilege!
AAD00100340	This new Sheriff Meyers you brought to us is a lawman through and through. Primm's looking up, stranger.
AAD00100341	Thanks for convincing Meyers to come sheriff for us. First time I feel safe in a long time.
AAD00100342	You're back. Do you need medical attention?
AAD00100343	If you're looking for supplies, Chet over at the general store can help you out.
AAD00100344	I hope you didn't just bring a heap of trouble down on Goodsprings by killing Joe Cobb like that.
AAD00100345	His friends might come looking for him, and I don't think they're going to care who was involved in his death or not.
AAD00100346	Well, what's done is done. So, uh, what can I do for you?
AAD00100347	Can't do business now! There's a gunfight!
AAD00100348	Thank you!
AAD00100349	We showed them a thing or two.
AAD00100350	A little payback feels real good.
AAD00100351	These bastards got what they deserved.
AAD00100352	This has been a long time coming. The rest of the Legion better watch out.
AAD00100353	It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had some time to rest around here.
AAD00100354	Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
AAD00100355	The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting than be captured.
AAD00100356	I don't know how we're going to hold off the Legion here and at Hoover Dam, we just don't have the manpower.
AAD00100357	I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
AAD00100358	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
AAD00100359	Hell of a thing for Boone to kill Ranger Andy like that.
AAD00100360	The McBrides think some mysterious creature is shooting up their Brahmin. Gotta be somebody in town doing it.
AAD00100361	Perimeter's been quiet since you left. The Fiends are running scared. I doubt they'll give us any more trouble, not for a long while.
AAD00100362	I haven't got any more bounties for you. It's been quiet and calm since you last reported in. Just how I like it.
AAD00100363	I heard you killed Driver Nephi. My team would've liked to get a shot at him... but we're still glad he's dead.
AAD00100364	K-killing some Fiends? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
AAD00100365	Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
AAD00100366	Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!
AAD00100367	What a pointless trip. Here I thought I'd get a shot at that junkie bastard.
AAD00100368	I've been seeing Usanagi, and things are better. I'm not so angry all the time, you know? And, uh, I'm not trying to jump every woman in camp.
AAD00100369	Well, not all the time, anyway.
AAD00100370	Took some skills to bring down that Fiend. You done good.
AAD00100371	Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
AAD00100372	Never lost a CO before. It doesn't feel right.
AAD00100373	The lockdown is lifted! The patrols are going to start up again! Do you know what this means? I'll actually be able to get into a real fight!
AAD00100374	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
AAD00100375	Hey, so Hardin becoming Elder was because of you, huh? Good job. Now that the lockdown is lifted, I may get a chance to get into a real fight!
AAD00100376	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
AAD00100377	Yeah?
AAD00100378	Listen up. I'm in charge of security around here, and I can't say I'm too happy about having an outsider waltzing around.
AAD00100379	But since you came in with Veronica, I'm inclined to cut you a little slack. Just behave yourself and we won't have any problems, okay?
AAD00100380	Oh, and the Elder's going to want to talk to you. He's on the second level. Just take a right once you get down there.
AAD00100381	My office is right here in case you need anything. Just ask for Ramos.
AAD00100382	Your presence here... Let's just say it's highly irregular.
AAD00100383	Outsiders aren't even allowed to know that our bunker's here, let alone come and go freely.
AAD00100384	You impressed Elder McNamara, obviously. He must believe that you'd be very useful.
AAD00100385	Shhh. I thought I heard something up by the entrance.
AAD00100386	Powder Ganger scum! Hands up or die!
AAD00100387	Thought you'd sneak up on me, you filthy Powder Ganger?
AAD00100388	At least with the lockdown lifted I'll be able to resupply my store more often. So what are you here for?
AAD00100389	Hello, you must be the outsider everyone's talking about. I'm Linda Schuler. If you ever need medical attention, this is the place to come.
AAD00100390	Hey, stranger! Where ya been, uh? I missed you!
AAD00100391	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer himself! Welcome back.
AAD00100392	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer herself! Welcome back.
AAD00100393	What are you doing here!? I don't want to be near you ever again! Leave, leave... just leave, okay!?
AAD00100394	Behave, and don't give me a reason to kick you out.
AAD00100395	Wow... I've never seen anyone go into the Lucky 38 before.
AAD00100396	Don't mind me. I was just passing by.
AAD00100397	I bet everyone's going to hear about you going into the 38.
AAD00100398	My pals said nobody has ever been inside the Lucky 38.
AAD00100399	Hey, sexy, come by the Tops later. I'd love to hear your story.
AAD00100400	We've got nothing left to talk about.
AAD00100401	Well look at that! You aren't a Powder Ganger after all. I'd suggest against wearing that outfit around the townsfolk. You may get shot by accident.
AAD00100402	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me?
AAD00100403	What is it?
AAD00100404	Well, if there was any question on whether I should leave, I guess there's my answer.
AAD00100405	Pretty addictive, right? You do it once, it just makes you want to do it more.
AAD00100406	You can't help but notice that the Brotherhood barely exist to these people out here. We're like an urban myth. No real presence on the Outside.
AAD00100407	We just don't adapt like we should. Used to be that all you needed to get your way was a suit of power armor and a laser rifle.
AAD00100408	Now... people are armed and organized. They're not afraid. But we still stick to our old approach, because it's all we know.
AAD00100409	Wow, Mr. House is looking for you, huh? What do you think he wants? Bowling partner?
AAD00100410	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
AAD00100411	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
AAD00100412	If Mr. House is going to lower his standards, we'll just have to raise ours!
AAD00100413	Caesar may have deemed you worthy to bear his mark, but your reputation preceeds you.
AAD00100414	Your presence will be tolerated, but you are not welcome here. Lucullus awaits you on the docks.
AAD00100415	Do not make Caesar wait! Lucullus awaits you on the dock.
AAD00100416	A Profligate bearing the Mark of Caesar? What is the world coming to?
AAD00100417	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you with the barge at the docks. He will take you to The Fort to speak with Caesar.
AAD00100418	Get moving, Profligate! Do not make Caesar wait!
AAD00100419	You're the one Lucullus said would come? You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
AAD00100420	What are you doing standing around, whelp? {KAI-zar)Caesar awaits!
AAD00100421	You're the one Lucullus said would come. You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
AAD00100422	Caesar does not like to be kept waiting. I would find Cursor Lucullus quickly and travel to The Fort, if I were you.
AAD00100423	He should still be waiting at the docks.
AAD00100424	Ave. Have you come to sell or trade for captures?
AAD00100425	NCR Trooper, reporting for duty!
AAD00100426	Trooper, ready to fight!
AAD00100427	You called for a Trooper?
AAD00100428	You called for an extra gun?
AAD00100429	I got your call and came running.
AAD00100430	Guns and gear - at your service.
AAD00100431	Someone said you needed backup? I'm it.
AAD00100432	You called for backup?
AAD00100433	Where's the fight, sir?
AAD00100434	For the Republic!
AAD00100435	Ranger at the ready!
AAD00100436	NCR Ranger, reporting for duty!
AAD00100437	Here we are, you just point and we'll shoot.
AAD00100438	Here I am, just point at what needs killing.
AAD00100439	One riot, one ranger... let's get this done.
AAD00100440	Heard you were in a spot of trouble, friend. Let's fix that.
AAD00100441	For the Republic!
AAD00100442	You called for an extra gun?
AAD00100443	You're lucky I happened to be nearby.
AAD00100444	I got your flank - you just shoot what's in front of you!
AAD00100445	Ranger here - where's the fight?
AAD00100446	So, Mr. House doesn't care that one of Caesar's most notorious Legion spies is walking around on the Strip.
AAD00100447	Either that or his Securitrons' AI is too primitive to recognize the threat. Neither answer is particularly comforting.
AAD00100448	I've read about REPCONN. I think they did some work with the... the government before the war. Rockets and some energy weapon prototypes, I think.
AAD00100449	Interesting way of handling things. Very sub rosa.
AAD00100450	I don't know if the Scorpions deserve to be wiped out for something they didn't do, but that's one less problem Westside has to deal with.
AAD00100451	I shouldn't be surprised at what happened with Moreno. I hoped that after all this time, he could put his anger behind him.
AAD00100452	Maybe everything good in Orion Moreno died at Navarro, and it was foolish to think there was anything in him left to salvage.
AAD00100453	In case it's not obvious, I think you should redirect the power to Freeside and Outer Vegas.
AAD00100454	Head voices don't *like* you, squishy man!
AAD00100455	I've heard of you. Just remember whose side you're on out there.
AAD00100456	I don't know if you know, but since Jeannie May passed, I've been keeping an eye on her properties for her.
AAD00100457	I think it's time we gave everything back to you, so take this key and make yourself at home at our motel.
AAD00100458	It'll open the room on the second floor, closest to the lobby. Hope it suits you.
AAD00100459	Hey, thanks for all the hard work back there. I'm going to run a tight ship here, don't you worry.
AAD00100460	It's time for the meeting with the bosses. We can't chit chat right now.
AAD00100461	Man, thanks for finding out that shit. Fuck Big Sal.
AAD00100462	Good to see you again. I hope you're winning some money in here.
AAD00100463	I'm happy to see you again. Carlitos and I have been living here since our escape. We'll never forget what you've done for us.
AAD00100464	Are you fucking kidding me?
AAD00100465	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' Grim fucking Reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, man?
AAD00100466	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
AAD00100467	Are you fucking kidding me?
AAD00100468	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' Grim fucking Reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, bitch?
AAD00100469	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
AAD00100470	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, teaching a lesson, if you will.
AAD00100471	When you move on, teach everyone you meet the lessons Caesar's Legion taught here. Especially any NCR troops you run across.
AAD00100472	Hah! And we were just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed you!
AAD00100473	If anyone belongs on a cross, it's you! For your crimes against the Legion, you will die!
AAD00100474	You're always welcome around the Hope, Courier - least as far as I'm concerned.
AAD00100475	I can still hear our boys screaming down there.
AAD00100476	They've got our guys down there.
AAD00100477	Wish we could do something for the troopers down there.
AAD00100478	Thanks for the help with the hostages!
AAD00100479	I can't believe you broke into the mine and saved those miners.
AAD00100480	The hostages are safe. We owe you.
AAD00100481	I see you reached your destination safely. Shall we get to work?
AAD00100482	Do you have the slightest idea of what you've done, of what you've destroyed?
AAD00100483	You've doomed Vegas to be ruled by corrupt bureaucrats or fanatical savages.
AAD00100484	Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.
AAD00100485	Benny is dead, and yet you don't appear to be carrying the Platinum Chip.
AAD00100486	I don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
AAD00100487	You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver a package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
AAD00100488	I will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted... negative outcomes. But - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
AAD00100489	Well, enough. Let's have the Chip, then.
AAD00100490	Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's little else for us to discuss until you have.
AAD00100491	Your next assignment won't take you far. It concerns the Omertas and their den of vice, Gomorrah.
AAD00100492	As the decisive encounter between the bull and the bear looms close, my concerns about the Omertas have grown.
AAD00100493	I've never expected loyalty, mind you. A reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always runs true.
AAD00100494	But that's just it - lately the Omertas' cooperative silence has been deafening. Not a single complaint? They're up to something.
AAD00100495	As I said before, I need you to investigate the Omertas, to see what they're up to.
AAD00100496	Your next assignment is to locate and destroy remnants of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.
AAD00100497	The NCR nearly did the job at HELIOS One a few years ago, but there seem to have been survivors, unfortunately.
AAD00100498	Given the Brotherhood's fanatical views on technology, they can be counted on to oppose my regime.
AAD00100499	Please - put them out of my misery.
AAD00100500	Your reputation with the NCR isn't exactly stellar, so I'll have to vouch for you. It'll make a scene, but it's worth it.
AAD00100501	Kimball is dead - what a mess you've made!
AAD00100502	I'm glad to see a fellow trooper. My squad is in trouble.
AAD00100503	Confound it, Cheyenne, why'd you have to go running in like that? You were supposed to stay.
AAD00100504	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this. I'm not gonna be very good company right now.
AAD00100505	I did have another thing to teach, but I'll understand if you'd rather I just pay you so you can be on your way.
AAD00100506	Ah, hell's bells. There's not a day passes by I don't tell people not to come here by themselves.
AAD00100507	Some people, your word just isn't good enough for them. Then this happens.
AAD00100508	Well, it's a part of life out here. Best to accept it.
AAD00100509	But you did what you promised, staying out here with me. Here's my end of the deal.
AAD00100510	Everything all right?
AAD00100511	Hnh. Heard your footsteps coming up the ramp, didn't sound like a trooper or one of the merchants.
AAD00100512	You check out the Nipton Town Hall yet? Smoke trail's not getting any shorter.
AAD00100513	You a courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
AAD00100514	Okay, that's that. No more games for you. Go rob the Tops. You're done here.
AAD00100515	Have some drinks, talk to some dancers but you are done at my tables.
AAD00100516	You know what, what happened to my caravan - not the first time I've heard about an attack like that.
AAD00100517	One of our caravans got hit a few months back, and the caravan'd been burned, too, along with the cargo.
AAD00100518	I wonder if he made the same mistake, and that other caravan got hit with energy weapons too.
AAD00100519	What's that? Looks like a map - got the route along the West of Vegas, and...
AAD00100520	...they've marked another spot. Over here, along this stretch. That's fucked up - middle of nowhere.
AAD00100521	That does it, that's all I need to know.
AAD00100522	Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs... they were behind burning these caravans, and they've got to answer for them.
AAD00100523	I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, and then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
AAD00100524	Keep your voice down, we got movement out there.
AAD00100525	Ready to leave yet? This place puts my teeth on edge.
AAD00100526	Just trimmed the Van Graff family tree, I think Freeside'll breathe a little easier now.
AAD00100527	And that's it for the Crimson Caravan.
AAD00100528	You find any "evidence" yet? I'm not going to wait forever.
AAD00100529	Not sure who this friend of yours is, but if he's looking down on Vegas, he's either God or the moon.
AAD00100530	So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow brick road, and there's bad news at the end.
AAD00100531	First Vegas, now NCR and Legion? You're being courted more than a Redding widow.
AAD00100532	Hope you can answer them politely, or there's no safe place in the Mojave for you.
AAD00100533	Mojave's almost buzzing like a Cazador now... must be all the blood Legion and NCR are spilling over the Colorado.
AAD00100534	Guess there's no turning back now, it's war. If Hoover Dam's where it's going to go down, better make it count.
AAD00100535	Oh, you look like you got something else to say besides ordering me around.
AAD00100536	Let's hear it, you look all serious.
AAD00100537	Something to say to me other than guns, distance, and stimming?
AAD00100538	Whoa, why you leaning in all of a sudden?
AAD00100539	You and me, we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
AAD00100540	I thought there was a chance you'd change - not any longer, being a fucker is who you are.
AAD00100541	Always good to see you, pardner! Anything I can help you with?
AAD00100542	There's nothing here for you, human, though it is always good to see you.
AAD00100543	I don't even remember where we were going, but it'll be good to travel around with Rhonda again.
AAD00100544	Where did the rest of my kin go? All alone now...
AAD00100545	Come and get it, you big dumb -
AAD00100546	Hey! You're not one of those things out there. Who the hell are you?
AAD00100547	Colonel Hsu really knows what he's doing. Now if only someone'd explain that to ol' General Wait-and-See Oliver...
AAD00100548	I pity anyone who crosses Boyd. That woman is relentless.
AAD00100549	We still haven't gotten Ranger Morales' body back from the Fiends. Sure doesn't inspire confidence in the guys you're serving with.
AAD00100550	Contreras is holding out on me. I know he's got more to sell.
AAD00100551	Man, Doc Kemp really fixed me up right the last time I got shot. He's the man to see if you need some fixin'.
AAD00100552	Farber is doing the best with what he's got, but man could I go for a nice cut of brahmin steak.
AAD00100553	You look like someone in need of a reliable supplier.
AAD00100554	So you're back.
AAD00100555	What did Contreras say?
AAD00100556	Be careful out there. We already lost Jackson doing what you're trying to do.
AAD00100557	You again? What do you need?
AAD00100558	Howdy, looking for chow?
AAD00100559	Even that old House bastard gave in to the NCR. We're the only ones to make a stand!
AAD00100560	What are we going to do now that Papa's dead?
AAD00100561	Your friend's cute - is she single?
AAD00100562	I hope Papa knew what he was doing when he left you in charge.
AAD00100563	A robot dog? Never seen one of those before.
AAD00100564	Your pal's one ugly motherfucker.
AAD00100565	Holy hell, is that a Nightkin?
AAD00100566	Nice robot.
AAD00100567	You know you're traveling with a fucking murderer?
AAD00100568	Haven't seen a Follower around here in years.
AAD00100569	I ought to bleed you.
AAD00100570	Fuck off and die.
AAD00100571	Like we don't have enough problems.
AAD00100572	Just get the fuck out of here.
AAD00100573	What the fuck are you doing showing your face here?
AAD00100574	Why are you even here?
AAD00100575	Crazy-ass mother fucker.
AAD00100576	You been dosing on too many of Jack's chems?
AAD00100577	You're almost as crazy as some Fiends I know.
AAD00100578	Oh great, just who I wanted to see.
AAD00100579	You going to fuck shit up again?
AAD00100580	What do you want this time?
AAD00100581	You should have been with us in our glory days. You'd have loved it.
AAD00100582	Share a whiskey with me sometime?
AAD00100583	I wish there were more like you.
AAD00100584	I like you, stranger. You've stood by us when not many would.
AAD00100585	Good to see you again.
AAD00100586	Why'd you come here?
AAD00100587	Come to gawk at the Great Khans, have you? Fuck off.
AAD00100588	What do you want?
AAD00100589	So you've been sucked into the decadence of the Strip as well, have you?
AAD00100590	NCR spreads its infection to another town, I hear.
AAD00100591	I'm glad our brothers have returned home from Boulder City.
AAD00100592	Why did you kill our brothers in Boulder City?
AAD00100593	More Khan brothers cut down by NCR in Boulder City. We should kill a hundred of them in response!
AAD00100594	The 1st Recon butchers are in the field again. I'd love to head down to Forlorn Hope and show them we haven't forgotten.
AAD00100595	Diane's going nuts trying to find a new contact in the Fiends now that Motor-Runner's dead.
AAD00100596	So, the big bad chief ranger couldn't take the pressure, huh? Good.
AAD00100597	If you're going to assassinate the president of the NCR, you could at least do it right.
AAD00100598	Why the hell would you stop someone from killing Kimball?
AAD00100599	If you ask me, a true warrior wouldn't let himself be captured at all - but busting that Legionnaire out of McCarran was an impressive stunt.
AAD00100600	Not many get the favor of Caesar - even Papa hasn't been to the Fort.
AAD00100601	Mr. House isn't a man to be trusted. Watch yourself.
AAD00100602	You're the one who killed Kimball! If we had a bar here, I'd buy you a drink!
AAD00100603	I apologize, wanderer, but I must go tend to my flock!
AAD00100604	You looking for a good time?
AAD00100605	If I wasn't working right now, I'd show you a real nice time.
AAD00100606	Enjoying the show?
AAD00100607	I wouldn't mind taking a bite of you.
AAD00100608	Damn, you're looking tasty.
AAD00100609	I got kicked outta Ultra-Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking freaks.
AAD00100610	Business is good. All the Families got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
AAD00100611	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
AAD00100612	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
AAD00100613	What the fuck is that thing?
AAD00100614	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
AAD00100615	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
AAD00100616	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
AAD00100617	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
AAD00100618	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
AAD00100619	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
AAD00100620	Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
AAD00100621	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AAD00100622	The most important POW we've ever taken and he gets away. He must've had help.
AAD00100623	Can't believe the Legion hit us in such numbers. They're stronger than we think.
AAD00100624	Lieutenant Markland always looks like he's afraid the kids are gonna bite him.
AAD00100625	Markland seems to be getting better with his bedside manner.
AAD00100626	Doc's gotten real handy with the kids these days.
AAD00100627	Hope the Doc can give me some meds this week.
AAD00100628	The "great" republic couldn't find enough soldiers to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
AAD00100629	Ave. Why have you come to Nelson?
AAD00100630	The Followers are always on the look out for new friends like yourself.
AAD00100631	I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
AAD00100632	Look at that - a cyber-dog. There can't be many of those left.
AAD00100633	Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
AAD00100634	That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
AAD00100635	Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
AAD00100636	That's a First Recon beret. They're the best marksmen in the NCR military.
AAD00100637	I'll never get used to the sight of ghouls.
AAD00100638	Don't let anything happen to Arcade, all right?
AAD00100639	Excuse me.
AAD00100640	My feet are killing me.
AAD00100641	The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
AAD00100642	How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
AAD00100643	Ugh. One of the burned people walks in our camp.
AAD00100644	What a strange floating robot. Is it useful for anything?
AAD00100645	What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
AAD00100646	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.
AAD00100647	I hear the Great Khans just packed up and left Red Rock Canyon. Always thought the NCR and them would fight it out again.
AAD00100648	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
AAD00100649	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed up no more.
AAD00100650	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
AAD00100651	Someone finally put down that sick Motor-Runner sonofabitch. Good riddance.
AAD00100652	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
AAD00100653	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
AAD00100654	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
AAD00100655	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
AAD00100656	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
AAD00100657	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AAD00100658	The Great Khans up and left Red Rock Canyon. Who's gonna brew fresh chems now?
AAD00100659	I hear the Great Khans got massacred again. No survivors this time, though.
AAD00100660	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
AAD00100661	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
AAD00100662	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
AAD00100663	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
AAD00100664	A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
AAD00100665	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
AAD00100666	What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
AAD00100667	I bet dirty business is going on at Gomorrah.
AAD00100668	I bet dirty business is going on at Gomorrah.
AAD00100669	Look, "friend," don't get near me - you're too well respected for my business.
AAD00100670	I'm glad Ringo's back. Got a good story to tell, too.
AAD00100671	Colonel Moore survived four tours against the Brotherhood back west. If anyone can help take on the Legion, it's her.
AAD00100672	You hear that rumor that Colonel Moore was kicked out of Gomorrah a while back? I heard she's had it in for the Omertas ever since.
AAD00100673	I'm really surprised Colonel Moore accepted the Brotherhood's help. I heard she lost a lot of men in war with them back west.
AAD00100674	Man, I'm exhausted. Moore's got us running drills non-stop.
AAD00100675	Just between us, Colonel Moore scares me sometimes.
AAD00100676	Oliver's head is as good as mine!
AAD00100677	Is it true the fighting outside has stopped already?
AAD00100678	Upstairs, or down? If I were a coward, where would I hide?
AAD00100679	Make good use of cover. The time to strike is when they reload.
AAD00100680	Their guns aren't quite as effective in these close quarters.
AAD00100681	Soon this place will belong to the Legion.
AAD00100682	I've added eight notches to my belt already. How many for you?
AAD00100683	I hope the Legion doesn't get in here.
AAD00100684	Sorry, but I'm busy with patients right now.
AAD00100685	Julie Farkas wasn't kidding when she said we would be needed here.
AAD00100686	All this bloodshed. Such a waste of human life.
AAD00100687	Please don't hurt me!
AAD00100688	I'm just a medic! Please don't hurt me!
AAD00100689	Damn, that was some light show out there.
AAD00100690	Hey man, when in Rome.
AAD00100691	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time.
AAD00100692	Is there a problem here?
AAD00100693	You again. What's your problem?
AAD00100694	Make it quick. We don't have much time.
AAD00100695	It's unlikely the Legion will try anything, but we'll be prepared for it anyway.
AAD00100696	I'm so excited about the President visiting. This is going to be great!
AAD00100697	The Legion is attacking! Run for your lives!
AAD00100698	I'm too young to die!
AAD00100699	Quiet, I'm trying to listen to the speech.
AAD00100700	Not right now. President Kimball is giving his speech.
AAD00100701	Shh! I want to hear what is going on.
AAD00100702	President Kimball is really well-spoken.
AAD00100703	It was such an honor to be here today. I'm so lucky.
AAD00100704	That's a nice suit President Kimball had.
AAD00100705	Nothing is going to happen to the President on my watch.
AAD00100706	Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company, New Vegas branch. What may I do for you?
AAD00100707	Naughty children run from their punishment, but we'll find Benny, won't we, Leo?
AAD00100708	Now sweetie, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That goes for learning to ride bikes and killing Presidents!
AAD00100709	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, assassinating the President like that!
AAD00100710	Leo's very grumpy, pumpkin. He wanted to chop the President!
AAD00100711	Penthouse floor!
AAD00100712	High-Roller Suite!
AAD00100713	B2! Physical Plant!
AAD00100714	Yes? Something else you needed?
AAD00100715	I received a pleasant call from Dr. Keely. It seems we have you to thank for keeping her alive. Very charitable of you.
AAD00100716	Ah! I was just wondering what had become of you.
AAD00100717	What are you doing in my office? You're not welcome here, get out!
AAD00100718	Little busy at the moment. But I can talk.
AAD00100719	If you can find Keely and keep her safe, I'll pay you what I can. I gave my word, and I meant it.
AAD00100720	Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
AAD00100721	She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy.
AAD00100722	Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
AAD00100723	Did you find Keely? You haven't been back for a while, so I was hoping...
AAD00100724	Oh! Good to see you again.
AAD00100725	You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or...
AAD00100726	This Vault-Tec machinery is so fragile. I had to jury-rig this elevator a few days... and it's on the fritz again already.
AAD00100727	Ah, that's got it. See you upstairs.
AAD00100728	Ah, good. You survived. I was beginning to think you hadn't. You'll be pleased to know that the spores should no longer be a problem.
AAD00100729	Now all that's left is to ensure that none of this ever happens again. The research that led to these abominations must be erased.
AAD00100730	Don't mind me. I have to wrap things up here, gather my gear, that sort of thing. I'll be leaving soon enough.
AAD00100731	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AAD00100732	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
AAD00100733	Fuck you.
AAD00100734	You're back. What's the word from Papa Khan?
AAD00100735	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AAD00100736	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
AAD00100737	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
AAD00100738	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
AAD00100739	This has been a dream come true to work on the Lady. I don't think I've seen Loyal this frisky in years.
AAD00100740	Have you seen her? The redhead of my dreams?
AAD00100741	Hi! I can't believe I'm going to meet my red-headed lady soon! I'm really nervous about it!
AAD00100742	You're a terrible person! I loved her! And you let her run right into our killzone. Why didn't you stop her?
AAD00100743	Go to hell, outsider. Stay away from me.
AAD00100744	Hey there. Back for more?
AAD00100745	That was pretty incredible. I've never seen anyone come out of the Boomers' rain of death alive before.
AAD00100746	Hey there lady! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
AAD00100747	Hey there mister! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
AAD00100748	Hi again! Have you found Mister Cuddles?
AAD00100749	Pearl sent word saying it's all right to tell you about the Lady in the water.
AAD00100750	It's going to be a dream come true once you've raised that bomber from Lake Mead!
AAD00100751	I hope Pearl knows what she's doing, letting you wander around Nellis as you please.
AAD00100752	What is it, Outsider?
AAD00100753	Hey! Do you have any toys outside of here? I sure could use something fun.
AAD00100754	I've heard about what you've done around here, and I have nothing to say to you, outsider.
AAD00100755	Hold it right there! Don't you move!
AAD00100756	How the hell did you survive that bombardment?
AAD00100757	Yes, Outsider?
AAD00100758	No offense, but I need to focus on getting more rest when I'm off duty. I'm not sleeping so good. So now's not a good time.
AAD00100759	If you want to talk, catch me when I'm on duty. I'm up in the dinosaur after 9 pm.
AAD00100760	Let's get out of this first.
AAD00100761	Pisses me off that Legion slavers can just operate on NCR turf like that.
AAD00100762	If we hadn't caught up to them they'd probably have a clear path to the river. No one to stop them.
AAD00100763	There should be patrols. Checkpoints. We got greedy, overstretched. Now our own territory isn't secure.
AAD00100764	Hey. I want to thank you for bringing me to Bitter Springs. Things seem... clearer now.
AAD00100765	Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
AAD00100766	You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
AAD00100767	I can spot a Brotherhood spy from a thousand yards. Even the cute ones.
AAD00100768	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
AAD00100769	That thing is housebroken, right?
AAD00100770	I like you big mutants. You're easy to sight.
AAD00100771	Did you know you have a robot following you?
AAD00100772	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
AAD00100773	Keep your distance, soldier.
AAD00100774	A doctor? Who's your supplier?
AAD00100775	I actually got to fly Pearl for a little bit during that bombing run. Hot damn, what an honor.
AAD00100776	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
AAD00100777	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
AAD00100778	Nice work with the assassination attempt! If my troops were half as dedicated as you, we'd win the war in a week!
AAD00100779	Thanks for your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
AAD00100780	Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's your story?
AAD00100781	I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
AAD00100782	Razz said the candy he got us was special! I wonder what he- Gnaaah, kill, kill, rip and kill! -meant by that?
AAD00100783	Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta write my mama and tell her I met you!
AAD00100784	Ever since consuming those "illicit rations" Razz offered us, I have felt a steadily-increasing desire to kill.
AAD00100785	You've done an excellent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
AAD00100786	Ha ha, fuck me, Jack's shit is still the best!
AAD00100787	So I finally get to meet the courier who's caused so much trouble for the New California Republic.
AAD00100788	So I finally get to meet the courier who's accomplished so much in so little time. That's why I summoned you here, right?
AAD00100789	I mean, a man nearly kills you, and your response is to track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
AAD00100790	There are rewards for doing as I command. Today, your reward is vengeance. You get to decide how Benny dies.
AAD00100791	Go to Benny, let him know what you've decided. My Praetorians will perform the execution - unless you want to perform it yourself.
AAD00100792	I want you to forge an alliance between Caesar's Legion and the White Glove Society.
AAD00100793	They used to be cannibals. I expect that information can be used to manipulate them. Go to -
AAD00100794	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
AAD00100795	Have you been successful in your efforts to recruit the White Glove Society?
AAD00100796	All right, let's state the obvious. There's something wrong with me.
AAD00100797	The headaches started a couple of months ago. They weren't too bad at first... but now they come frequently and they're... debilitating.
AAD00100798	For the past two weeks, my left leg has been dragging. It's stiffer, hard to move. And you've seen me blank out.
AAD00100799	Lucius says I stare into space, blink a few times, then keep talking like nothing happened. So what's the diagnosis?
AAD00100800	My forces are in a position to assault the Dam. Legatus Lanius has assumed command.
AAD00100801	Are you ready to go to him? To tell him to begin the assault?
AAD00100802	How much ass did you have to kick to get Papa Khan to like you so much?
AAD00100803	I understand you've been invited to meet with Caesar. You should be aware of the honor you've been granted.
AAD00100804	Thanks again for saving my ass.
AAD00100805	Any luck finding Anders?
AAD00100806	You're not one of my regulars. What do you want?
AAD00100807	Hey, what's up?
AAD00100808	Well, well, well, if it ain't the best-loved cat on the Strip in my theater! What can Tommy do for you, baby?
AAD00100809	Now baby, you know I welcome everybody here at the Aces, but I gotta ask you to keep any mayhem to a minimum, you dig?
AAD00100810	I got to hand it to you, baby, you did an 18-karat job on this one. My schedule's so full I couldn't put on new acts if I wanted to!
AAD00100811	Hey, come on, pal, I'm trying to put on a show here, you're welcome!
AAD00100812	I just can't believe it... the President's dead. It doesn't even feel real.
AAD00100813	I'll give you this, you've got a lot of guts walking in here like this.
AAD00100814	I really appreciate those books. They've already been a huge help.
AAD00100815	Been doing a lot of good work out there, setting an example for the others - I know Ranger Jackson appreciates it.
AAD00100816	Back 'round? Just my luck... what'll it be this time?
AAD00100817	Excuse me, but I'm busy.
AAD00100818	Don't worry boss, I'm sure Caesar just wants to invite you over for coffee or something. That's all.
AAD00100819	I'm glad you decided to off one of the most powerful men in the Mojave. Life was getting boring anyway. Really.
AAD00100820	Did blowing up that vault serve any purpose, or do you just like explosions?
AAD00100821	Just to be clear, we're not planning to visit any NCR facilities, right boss? Like, ever again?
AAD00100822	Well, the President's dead, but don't worry. History has shown that that sort of thing almost never leads to massive destabilizations or world wars.
AAD00100823	What the hell? Is that a half-robot dog?
AAD00100824	You better control that thing. Bots can't be trusted.
AAD00100825	A Follower is always welcome among our people.
AAD00100826	Keep the Ranger on a leash around here.
AAD00100827	Another Super Mutant roaming outer New Vegas, huh?
AAD00100828	All humans are welcome here, even Ghouls.
AAD00100829	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
AAD00100830	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
AAD00100831	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
AAD00100832	Only one bad thing about The Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
AAD00100833	Good to see you respect the Followers.
AAD00100834	Make sure the NCR dog behaves, you're in the Mojave now.
AAD00100835	Your merchant friend is always welcome among us.
AAD00100836	That bot of yours don't look like anything I've seen in the Mojave.
AAD00100837	Your friend's not from the desert, is she?
AAD00100838	You've made it! Thanks so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
AAD00100839	Just talk to Big Beard next to me, pal. Whoever's got the biggest whiskers, does the talking...
AAD00100840	I don't know how we pulled this off. For a minute there, I thought we were not going to make it.
AAD00100841	Without you, we'd have been in the losing end. Thank you so much for your help, friend.
AAD00100842	Hey, friend! It's good to see you again.
AAD00100843	This place doesn't have the glitter of the Strip, but I've got Joana - that's all I'll ever need.
AAD00100844	I kinda like being a farmer.
AAD00100845	Crops aren't getting as much water lately.
AAD00100846	We're better off with those slaver bastards Saint James and Dermot.
AAD00100847	That Sweetie sure is something.
AAD00100848	I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
AAD00100849	Can you spare some caps, mister?
AAD00100850	Can you spare some caps, ma'am?
AAD00100851	I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
AAD00100852	Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
AAD00100853	I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
AAD00100854	Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
AAD00100855	It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
AAD00100856	Back for more?
AAD00100857	I'm going to assume you had reason to kill Dermot and his pet. Always had a bad feeling about them. But everyone else here is hands-off.
AAD00100858	You can just talk to the whores, you know. You and me, we don't need to talk unless there's trouble.
AAD00100859	When I talk to a girl, I start the conversation! And I didn't start no conversation with you.
AAD00100860	Hey, baby. What say you and me get acquainted?
AAD00100861	Welcome to Casa Madrid - cheapest, cleanest whores in all New Vegas. If you want to know the rates for poon, talk to the whores.
AAD00100862	House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the Strip now.
AAD00100863	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
AAD00100864	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
AAD00100865	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
AAD00100866	I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
AAD00100867	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
AAD00100868	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR?
AAD00100869	Motor-Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
AAD00100870	Gotta wonder why the NCR hasn't come for us.
AAD00100871	We sure showed those bastards in the NCR.
AAD00100872	Haven't seen Meyers around. Did he run off or something?
AAD00100873	Scrambler's crazier than usual. Watch yourself.
AAD00100874	I hear that woman can kill with her eyes! Stay away from me!
AAD00100875	Your lady friend needs to lighten up.
AAD00100876	Better watch out, I hear Rex likes to eat his owners. Why do you think the King was so eager to give him away?
AAD00100877	Good to see Rex still around and kicking.
AAD00100878	That's one ragged Ghoul you've got with you. Seems like a good guy, though.
AAD00100879	That ghoul with you looks like he's older than the war! My the things he must have seen.
AAD00100880	Oh no, I hear those things eat people! Stay back, freak!
AAD00100881	Odd company you keep. I thought all Super Mutants were crazed cannibals.
AAD00100882	Weird robot. I don't think I've ever seen one of those before.
AAD00100883	That looks like one of those spybots I hear House has been secretly releasing at night.
AAD00100884	Business and luck don't often go hand-in-hand in the Mojave. Watch your back.
AAD00100885	Check out the Wrangler if she needs booze.
AAD00100886	Keep your guns to yourself and there won't be any trouble.
AAD00100887	You're not doing yourself a favor by having him tag along. NCR aren't welcome here.
AAD00100888	I hear that guy has hundreds of kills, not all of them deserving of death.
AAD00100889	I always thought there was more to Arcade than met the eye. I bet he'll do great things without the Followers holding him back.
AAD00100890	I'm surprised to see Arcade venturing out of the Old Mormon Fort. I thought science types preferred to stay indoors.
AAD00100891	Witch! Witch! You should be burned for all the people you've turned into newts!
AAD00100892	I hear the Kings were wiped out by some kind of Super Mutant ninja assassin paid by the NCR! Who else could have taken them down?!
AAD00100893	Some people are saying the Great Khans got drugged up out of their minds and attacked the dam.
AAD00100894	I heard the Khans went wild at Hoover Dam. I suppose they were looking for one last blaze of glory.
AAD00100895	I hear the Great Khans staged their own deaths to trick the NCR.
AAD00100896	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
AAD00100897	The Great Khans aren't gone. They're just hiding, biding their time...
AAD00100898	The Great Khans moved out? One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
AAD00100899	I heard Motor-Runner got taken down. Maybe the Fiends will finally destroy themselves now that he's gone.
AAD00100900	I hear Hanlon was working for the aliens and NCR found out.
AAD00100901	Chief Hanlon is dead? I hear that guy couldn't order himself out of a cardboard box, let alone command troops.
AAD00100902	My friends say you're working for the Illuminati, and that's why you killed Kimball. Watch your back. They have listening devices everywhere!
AAD00100903	Killing Kimball is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
AAD00100904	You freed that Silus guy from McCarran? Guess you've got your reasons for helping the Legion.
AAD00100905	Rumor has it Mr. House joined the NCR on account of some secret love child he never even knew he had.
AAD00100906	Howdy, doc. Strange to see you wandering around.
AAD00100907	I admire a woman who can hold her liquor. Cute to boot.
AAD00100908	She looks like she knows how to handle herself in a fight.
AAD00100909	I hope you programmed that thing to be friendly to Freesiders.
AAD00100910	Super Mutant? You don't look so super to me.
AAD00100911	How's it hangin', old man? Oh, sorry.
AAD00100912	Hey, Rex. I see your new master is keeping you polished up. Good for you.
AAD00100913	Cheer up, lady. You've still got your youth.
AAD00100914	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
AAD00100915	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
AAD00100916	There's a rumor going around that you saved the NCR president's life. I'm surprised you have the stones to show your face around here.
AAD00100917	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
AAD00100918	Were you the one who killed the NCR president? I'd like to shake your hand!
AAD00100919	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
AAD00100920	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
AAD00100921	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
AAD00100922	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
AAD00100923	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once, I'm almost glad we're down here.
AAD00100924	Keep an eye on Veronica here. She's a sharp one.
AAD00100925	Try to keep Veronica out of trouble, would you?
AAD00100926	If you're planning to take Veronica with you, be sure to have a good pair of earplugs with you. I'm kidding, Veronica! Put the power fist down!
AAD00100927	What a fascinating animal. I'm sure the scribes will want to take a look at him.
AAD00100928	Is that a Mk. III Support Model you have with you? I've seen references to them, but never with my own eyes. I imagine he makes a great pet.
AAD00100929	Where did you get that Eyebot? I've never seen one modified quite like that.
AAD00100930	Keep that mutant in line, or we'll put it down.
AAD00100931	Oh good, now I have to put up with the stench of rotting ghoul as well. I hope the air filters are working.
AAD00100932	I've heard that your friend there can put some of the senior scribes to shame.
AAD00100933	Why is your friend there glaring at me like that? Did I bump into him or something?
AAD00100934	Does Ramos know you're walking around without a guard?
AAD00100935	Are you adjusting to the bunker, outsider?
AAD00100936	Just between you and me, I'm glad you're here. This place needed a fresh face.
AAD00100937	So you're one of us now, eh? Truly it is a rare honor.
AAD00100938	How long before we resume normal patrols?
AAD00100939	After the battle at HELIOS One, some people were worried about the NCR coming after us, but this bunker is secure.
AAD00100940	Hardin will be Elder soon, mark my words.
AAD00100941	Why are we hiding down here? We should be avenging our fallen brothers!
AAD00100942	When are these night missions going to end?
AAD00100943	Ugh, more VR training. Maybe I'll hit the shooting range instead.
AAD00100944	After this, I have some weapons to repair.
AAD00100945	You've been outside. Is the NCR really still hunting us?
AAD00100946	The Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted... it can be seen from miles away.
AAD00100947	The food here is to die for. No one cooks Brahmin like Philippe.
AAD00100948	You double-crossing snake! I have nothing to say to someone so lowly and ill-mannered.
AAD00100949	Why are you standing still? Do you think the world waits for you while you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
AAD00100950	Why are you standing still? Do you think the world waits for you while you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
AAD00100951	You! What do you think you're doing?
AAD00100952	Now it can truly be said that not only do we dress better than anyone, we eat better as well.
AAD00100953	Our executive chef Philippe is the toast of New Vegas. His Brahmin Wellington is absolutely sublime.
AAD00100954	You watch yourself around Mr. Gunderson.
AAD00100955	Keep your distance. Who are you, and what do you want?
AAD00100956	That a pretty gal! Want to share? Ha ha ha!
AAD00100957	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
AAD00100958	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
AAD00100959	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
AAD00100960	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
AAD00100961	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
AAD00100962	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
AAD00100963	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
AAD00100964	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
AAD00100965	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
AAD00100966	The NCR's all over Primm. Steer clear.
AAD00100967	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
AAD00100968	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
AAD00100969	Didn't know they still had robo-dogs around.
AAD00100970	Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
AAD00100971	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
AAD00100972	Now there's a fine-looking woman. Just needs to ditch the robe.
AAD00100973	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
AAD00100974	We bought and sold guys like Four-Eyes over there like property back in the prison.
AAD00100975	No way I'm going back to prison.
AAD00100976	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
AAD00100977	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
AAD00100978	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
AAD00100979	Never gets old when something blows up.
AAD00100980	Wouldn't mind having one of those little flying robots myself.
AAD00100981	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AAD00100982	I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
AAD00100983	Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
AAD00100984	Everywhere I go, people are talking about our President's assassination.
AAD00100985	With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
AAD00100986	I see you prefer the company of anarchic cultists to civilized peoples.
AAD00100987	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
AAD00100988	You killed him! What have we done to you?
AAD00100989	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
AAD00100990	With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
AAD00100991	Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
AAD00100992	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone.
AAD00100993	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
AAD00100994	Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
AAD00100995	People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
AAD00100996	House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
AAD00100997	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
AAD00100998	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
AAD00100999	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
AAD00101000	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
AAD00101001	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
AAD00101002	I've seen Followers of the Apocalypse in my travels before.
AAD00101003	NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
AAD00101004	Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
AAD00101005	Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
AAD00101006	I've never seen a robot like that before.
AAD00101007	The Super Mutant's under control, I hope.
AAD00101008	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AAD00101009	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AAD00101010	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AAD00101011	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
AAD00101012	Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
AAD00101013	What on earth is *that* creature?
AAD00101014	Your lady friend seems out of place here.
AAD00101015	Your friend seems too civilized for a place like this.
AAD00101016	I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
AAD00101017	I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
AAD00101018	Kimball's luck ran out.
AAD00101019	It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
AAD00101020	What's up?
AAD00101021	Hey.
AAD00101022	Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
AAD00101023	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
AAD00101024	Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waver.
AAD00101025	Imagine, a Follower brave enough to leave Freeside.
AAD00101026	The dog is part-machine... but its brain is flesh.
AAD00101027	What a revolting sight. To call that a friend?
AAD00101028	That machine looks like a floating eye. I don't like it.
AAD00101029	How does one get that blue monster to obey?
AAD00101030	I've heard the stories of how you assassinated Kimball. It's all my Legionaries will talk about.
AAD00101031	Kimball's assassin is always welcome here.
AAD00101032	The Centurion Silus will be punished for letting himself be captured. Coward.
AAD00101033	Never once did I believe that Caesar was near death. I have friends in high places.
AAD00101034	Why is your degeneracy tolerated?
AAD00101035	Kimball's assassin. Nicely done.
AAD00101036	Hey, doll, how's my favorite girl? Got a kiss for me?
AAD00101037	Couldn't stay away, huh baby? Shoulda known. What can I do for you?
AAD00101038	This is neat! From this console I could've routed the dam's power input over to the Fort and activated that dormant army of Securitrons!
AAD00101039	So go ahead and blow up the dam's generators! And when that's done, head back upside and finish off the Legion and the NCR.
AAD00101040	Don't you just love that Platinum Chip? Buzzes with power and possibilities, doesn't it?
AAD00101041	If I were you, I'd almost want to deliver the Chip to Mr. House just to learn all its tricks!
AAD00101042	That is, unless you want to bring the NCR or Caesar's Legion to power! I wouldn't want to tell you what to do!
AAD00101043	Wow, you really blew up all those Securitrons at the Fort! Great! No problem!
AAD00101044	The Securitrons at the Fort are on standby... I see a status log here confirming that the Mark II OS upgrade installed correctly...
AAD00101045	They'll be all set to go once we boost my transmitting power and bring them online with the network! But we'll worry about that later!
AAD00101046	I can't believe Caesar is dead. What will we do now?
AAD00101047	Caesar has been seen walking among the troops. A good omen.
AAD00101048	Haven't had any reports from Station Charlie in a while - hope everything's okay.
AAD00101049	Don't tell the troopers, but the grub here is way better than the mess tent.
AAD00101050	You should talk to Chief Hanlon if you have any questions. He's usually up on the balcony.
AAD00101051	We're all impressed with the work you've done for us. I thought you might be able to make use of this.
AAD00101052	It's a key to a little hideaway south of here. We've used it as a place for Rangers to rest and resupply. I thought you might get good use out of it.
AAD00101053	I know who you are. I'm a patient man, but you'd better have a damn good reason to be standing here right now. Spit it out.
AAD00101054	Look who it is. I haven't had the privilege, but I'm told you've been an angel on our shoulder. What can we do for you at Camp McCarran?
AAD00101055	I'm glad we could finally meet. My sources tell me you've done some good work for us. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
AAD00101056	What are you doing here? You don't have clearance.
AAD00101057	Well?
AAD00101058	Man, am I bored.
AAD00101059	You weren't supposed to kill him! Goddamn it. Not only did we not get any information, but now you've ended his suffering, too.
AAD00101060	Shit, guess I can forget about a promotion this decade. Thanks a lot, asshole.
AAD00101061	Fuck. What am I going to tell the colonel?
AAD00101062	Poor guy. He's all tuckered out. Well, I guess we'll have to pick up where we left off tomorrow. Good work.
AAD00101063	I'm sure he'll have had enough after a few days of this. Or if we're lucky, a few months.
AAD00101064	I'll get someone in here to clean up the mess he made. You can head out for the day. Let's let him sleep.
AAD00101065	Hey, have you been able to bug Mr. House's network yet?
AAD00101066	Oh, hi. Thanks again for helping us with that data. I mean the feed only lasted about thirty seconds and it's not that useful, but... well, we tried.
AAD00101067	Thanks again for helping with Mr. House's data network. Come see me at the Old Mormon Fort if you get a chance.
AAD00101068	One of these days I'll save up enough to get out of here. One of these days...
AAD00101069	Hey stranger, if you're hungry, there's a man around here somewhere telling people where to get free food and water.
AAD00101070	Something you need, kid?
AAD00101071	Hey man, can you spare a few caps?
AAD00101072	How are you today? Santiago is fabulous!
AAD00101073	Ah... I wasn't expecting you to return.
AAD00101074	Hello. Lovely to meet you.
AAD00101075	I have nothing more to give. Leave me be.
AAD00101076	You seen Dixon around? He said he'd be back today.
AAD00101077	The King just sent a messenger over, saying these guys are off-limits. He's probably already heard about what you did here.
AAD00101078	Looks like you get to be a hero. Enjoy it while it lasts.
AAD00101079	Why Rexie, you look all better, boy! Good as new! Did my Rexie get a new brain?
AAD00101080	Things have been a lot better since you helped with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So, what can I do for you?
AAD00101081	Hold up. What's the password?
AAD00101082	I wish I'd never gotten involved with the Omertas. All of this bloodshed...
AAD00101083	One of these days, those bastards will get what's coming to them. In the meantime, I'll be sure to be more careful with my sales.
AAD00101084	Anyway, is there anything I can get you?
AAD00101085	That was a real mess the Omertas were looking to create. Glad you could get all that sorted.
AAD00101086	May have cost me some business, but at least we avoided a shitstorm.
AAD00101087	Anything I can get you?
AAD00101088	People say Mr. House hasn't been heard from in a while. Good riddance.
AAD00101089	Now what can I get for you?
AAD00101090	Welcome back, buddy!
AAD00101091	If you're looking for guns, talk to Mick. Otherwise, I've got a nice selection of general supplies.
AAD00101092	So, Ambassador Fancypants has graced us with his presence! I apologize if you're looking for Pre-War pipes and smoking jackets, I'm clean out.
AAD00101093	Hey, what can I get you?
AAD00101094	The only rule in Freeside is don't mess with the Kings.
AAD00101095	Watch yourself around here.
AAD00101096	If you're heading to the Strip, just go through the gate there.
AAD00101097	Freeside is the Kings' turf. Remember that.
AAD00101098	Great, another one come in from the wastes. Like this place isn't crowded enough.
AAD00101099	I don't care how you get your work done, but you keep your nose clean in Freeside.
AAD00101100	People are getting nervous about the Legion amassing on the other side of the river. I hope the NCR can hold against another attack.
AAD00101101	One of my aides said you got into the Lucky 38. If you see someone by the name of Emily near there, we would like you to work for us.
AAD00101102	So, last day on Earth, huh? Getting your affairs in order? Or are you still trying to work on that bad reputation of yours?
AAD00101103	The NCR just wants to be friends, but you don't seem to want to play nice. See you tomorrow.
AAD00101104	What in the goddamn...?
AAD00101105	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies...
AAD00101106	What in the goddamn...?
AAD00101107	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AAD00101108	Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
AAD00101109	Last we spoke, you were leaning in a more merciful direction...?
AAD00101110	What in the goddamn...?
AAD00101111	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AAD00101112	Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
AAD00101113	What in the goddamn...?
AAD00101114	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AAD00101115	Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
AAD00101116	What in the goddamn...?
AAD00101117	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
AAD00101118	Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
AAD00101119	All right, smoothskin, I'm letting you in. You better watch yourself. I'll sure as hell be watching you.
AAD00101120	It is almost time for the Great Journey!
AAD00101121	It is almost time for the Great Journey!
AAD00101122	Nice enough speech, I guess.
AAD00101123	Well, it's up to you to go launch the rockets. There's a small mission control room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pressing a button.
AAD00101124	It seems my work here is done, so I'll be on my way to Novac. We'll see how that works out.
AAD00101125	Leave me alone.
AAD00101126	PLAYER THROW GRENADE

AAD00101136	Do that again!
AAD00101137	Cool. Can I try?
AAD00101138	Do that someplace else!
AAD00101139	You tryin' to get me killed?
AAD00101140	Holster that. And be quick about it.
AAD00101141	Holster your iron, pardner!
AAD00101142	Quit it!
AAD00101143	Stop that!
AAD00101144	Hey! Do that somewhere else.

AAD00101152	What's your problem?
AAD00101153	Let me aim that for you next time.
AAD00101154	Am I gonna have to take that away from you?
AAD00101155	Uh, hate to criticize boss, but I'm not actually immortal. Just old.
AAD00101156	Come on, boss, I know I'm ugly, but I am on your side.
AAD00101157	If you want me to split, you could just say so.
AAD00101158	<growl>
AAD00101159	Would you keep it down?
AAD00101160	Waste of ammo.
AAD00101161	What, you see a scorpion?
AAD00101162	If you can't control it, keep it in your holster.
AAD00101163	You'll put someone's eye out with that, dearie!
AAD00101164	It's not nice to do things like that, dear!
AAD00101165	This noise is making Leo get antsy!
AAD00101166	Stop doing that, please.
AAD00101167	I'm not sure if you're trying to hit me or trying to miss me. Either way, stop it. Thanks.
AAD00101168	
AAD00101169	Keep that up, human…
AAD00101170	Whoa, someone's just come from the Wrangler.
AAD00101171	Keep it down, would ya? I already got a splitting headache.
AAD00101172	Whatever. Knock yourself out, for all I care.
AAD00101173	Weapons use is discouraged. Thank you for your cooperation.
AAD00101174	Please do not use your weapons. Thank you.

AAD00101176	A pulled trigger's a happy trigger!
AAD00101177	Yeah! Shoot it again!
AAD00101178	Cut it out, will you?
AAD00101179	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
AAD00101180	Put that away!
AAD00101181	Mind your weapon!
AAD00101182	Keep that shit away from me.
AAD00101183	What the fuck do you think you're doing?
AAD00101184	Stow that weapon, Outsider.

AAD00101203	Don't be ridiculous - point that somewhere else, will you?
AAD00101204	[Christine frowns, points at your collar, then hers.]
AAD00101205	I didn't take you for suicidal.
AAD00101206	Don't shoot. Bullets hurt.
AAD00101207	You're going to make this easy.
AAD00101208	Drop that weapon, Outsider.
AAD00101209	Who the fuck do you think you are?

AAD00101211	You think I don't see that?
AAD00101212	Don't tempt me.
AAD00101213	By Caesar, you're walking a fine line.
AAD00101214	If you need to shoot me, I won't complain!
AAD00101215	Hello! Look what's pointed at me!
AAD00101216	Don't worry about me! You can shoot if you want!
AAD00101217	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law will not be tolerated.
AAD00101218	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law is a serious offense.
AAD00101219	You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
AAD00101220	That's not funny.
AAD00101221	Quit screwing around!
AAD00101222	I wouldn't.
AAD00101223	I don't think so.
AAD00101224	How about I aim my gun at you for a while, see how you like it?
AAD00101225	You looking for trouble?
AAD00101226	I assure you, you look extremely virile. Now, would you mind pointing that somewhere else? Thanks.
AAD00101227	Uh... what's up?
AAD00101228	Why do we always hurt the ones we care about the most?
AAD00101229	You, uhh, you want to point that someplace else, boss? I got enough holes in me.
AAD00101230	Boss, why are you looking at me that way?
AAD00101231	I wouldn't mind this so much if it weren't for that maniacal gleam in your eye.
AAD00101232	<growl>
AAD00101233	Pull that trigger, you'll wish you hadn't.
AAD00101234	Don't like no one drawing a bead on me.

AAD00101236	Don't make me take that away.
AAD00101237	Are you drunk?
AAD00101238	Pumpkin, don't point that at grandma, there's a dear.
AAD00101239	Leo doesn't like that, dearie. You should stop.
AAD00101240	How about you line that up on a tin can instead?
AAD00101241	Don't even kid about that.
AAD00101242	You're lookin' at a heap of trouble if you want it.
AAD00101243	If you think you want trouble, then let fly.
AAD00101244	Don't even joke like that.
AAD00101245	Point that somewhere else!

AAD00101247	Point that somewhere else.
AAD00101248	For pete's sake...
AAD00101249	No respect.
AAD00101250	Stop that. I mean it!
AAD00101251	Quit it. You're making me nervous.
AAD00101252	Go ahead. Try me.
AAD00101253	Think you're tough, huh?
AAD00101254	You're not going to shoot me, are you?
AAD00101255	Is that loaded? Let me try it!
AAD00101256	Hey, I can almost see right down the barrel!
AAD00101257	That's not a good idea.
AAD00101258	What do you think you're doing?
AAD00101259	Think about it too hard and you'll get burned.
AAD00101260	Watch where you point that.
AAD00101261	Fire, and I won't take it lying down.
AAD00101262	Better be sure.

AAD00101264	Paladin.
AAD00101265	Hello, outsider.
AAD00101266	You're being watched, so don't get any ideas.
AAD00101267	The bunker takes a little getting used to, doesn't it?
AAD00101268	I got kicked outta Ultra-Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking freaks.
AAD00101269	I wouldn't mind hitting that, does she put out?
AAD00101270	Hey, good going with that hit on The Tops.
AAD00101271	Let's get going!
AAD00101272	That's the mook that killed Benny!
AAD00101273	That's the guy who killed Caesar!
AAD00101274	That's the chick who killed Caesar!
AAD00101275	Ain't you the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy, baby, showing your face in here.
AAD00101276	Ain't that the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy fella, showing his face in here.
AAD00101277	Ave, true to Caesar.
AAD00101278	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny.
AAD00101279	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
AAD00101280	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
AAD00101281	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
AAD00101282	Look who's here.
AAD00101283	Hello.
AAD00101284	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
AAD00101285	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
AAD00101286	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
AAD00101287	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
AAD00101288	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
AAD00101289	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
AAD00101290	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
AAD00101291	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once, I'm almost glad we're down here.
AAD00101292	You must have some serious brass to fight off Benny's goons. Bravo.
AAD00101293	You made a real mess of the Omertas. Looks like the place will be under new management now.
AAD00101294	You must have some real pull with House to get inside the Lucky 38.
AAD00101295	Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar! That son of a bitch had it coming!
AAD00101296	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
AAD00101297	Good going destroying House's Securitron Army. That old boy's had too much power for too long.
AAD00101298	I hear some Legionary named Silus got freed from McCarran. He's got quite the NCR kill count.
AAD00101299	Why didn't you just let Kimball get killed? What did he ever do for us to warrant saving his life?
AAD00101300	You must have thought you were hot shit going after Kimball like that, huh?
AAD00101301	I hear you bagged Kimball. Damn fine work, kid.
AAD00101302	Some President Kimball was. Chalk up another death to NCR incompetence.
AAD00101303	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
AAD00101304	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
AAD00101305	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
AAD00101306	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
AAD00101307	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
AAD00101308	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
AAD00101309	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
AAD00101310	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
AAD00101311	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
AAD00101312	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
AAD00101313	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
AAD00101314	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
AAD00101315	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
AAD00101316	It's too bad the NCR boss got out alive.
AAD00101317	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
AAD00101318	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
AAD00101319	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
AAD00101320	Only one bad thing about The Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
AAD00101321	Hey yeah. Hi.
AAD00101322	Was that a guy or a gal? Aw hell, I need to stop drinking.
AAD00101323	Ugh?
AAD00101324	What the hell? I didn't eat any corn this week.
AAD00101325	Ya got any grog?!
AAD00101326	Ya got any change, man? I've got two kids to feed.
AAD00101327	Ya got any change, man? I've got three kids to feed.
AAD00101328	Ya got any change, man? I've got seven kids to feed.
AAD00101329	Woooooo!
AAD00101330	You seen Gourd around?
AAD00101331	Oh, I don't think last night's rat is agreeing with me.
AAD00101332	Hey lady! I know you've got some hooch somewhere in there!
AAD00101333	Hey! Nice hat, nancy boy!
AAD00101334	Oh, my head is killing me. I need another drink.
AAD00101335	<Whistling>
AAD00101336	I swear Dixon's hooch is killing me.
AAD00101337	Motor-Runner is dead? Who the fuck is going to be running the show now?
AAD00101338	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR?
AAD00101339	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR?
AAD00101340	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
AAD00101341	Someone is targeting us. I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AAD00101342	Someone is targeting us. I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
AAD00101343	Someone is targeting us. I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.

AAD00101349	You need to get to the Legate!
AAD00101350	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
AAD00101351	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
AAD00101352	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
AAD00101353	Love how this place comes alive at night.
AAD00101354	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
AAD00101355	The Fiends have been less organized with Motor-Runner gone. Good riddance.
AAD00101356	Crazy Khan bastards. What were they thinking attacking the dam like that?
AAD00101357	People are talking, buddy. You've made quite an impression on The Strip.
AAD00101358	The Legion is bad enough. The last thing we needed around here is even tougher NCR Ranger thugs coming along.
AAD00101359	Without you, we'd all be slaves. Thanks for helping the NCR at the dam.
AAD00101360	Howdy, Arcade.
AAD00101361	Another NCR grunt.
AAD00101362	Good to see another strong-willed woman around.
AAD00101363	That is one odd robot.
AAD00101364	A Super Mutant in Freeside?
AAD00101365	That has to be the oldest Ghoul I've ever seen.
AAD00101366	What's up Rex?
AAD00101367	What's your problem, lady?
AAD00101368	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
AAD00101369	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
AAD00101370	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
AAD00101371	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AAD00101372	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
AAD00101373	What the fuck is that thing?
AAD00101374	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
AAD00101375	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
AAD00101376	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
AAD00101377	I hear you been making some waves around here.
AAD00101378	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
AAD00101379	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
AAD00101380	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
AAD00101381	Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
AAD00101382	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
AAD00101383	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone.
AAD00101384	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
AAD00101385	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!

AAD00101400	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball was struck down in a cowardly attack at Hoover Dam.
AAD00101401	The Strip offers many fine cocktail lounges where grieving persons may drown their sorrows.
AAD00101402	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.

AAD00101406	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
AAD00101407	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots. But lately some of them been two-faced.
AAD00101408	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
AAD00101409	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
AAD00101410	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
AAD00101411	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
AAD00101412	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!

AAD00101416	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
AAD00101417	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AAD00101418	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
AAD00101419	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
AAD00101420	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? Didn't know there was anything left there to attack.

AAD00101431	I hear the NCR and the Kings have been getting along. That's good news for Freeside.
AAD00101432	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
AAD00101433	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
AAD00101434	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
AAD00101435	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.

AAD00101444	They say the Legion's bringing in Veterans from out in Arizona. They must be getting ready to attack.
AAD00101445	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
AAD00101446	I hear reports of Legion raiding parties all over the place. They can't all be rumors!
AAD00101447	I keep hearing about some courier making a fuss over at the Strip. Must've delivered more than just mail.
AAD00101448	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.

AAD00101459	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
AAD00101460	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
AAD00101461	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
AAD00101462	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
AAD00101463	With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.

AAD00101475	Personal space meaning anything to you, lady?
AAD00101476	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
AAD00101477	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
AAD00101478	Word is those tough guy rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
AAD00101479	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
AAD00101480	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.

AAD00101761	Still searching.
AAD00101762	Still analyzing.
AAD00101763	Still attempting to reacquire target.
AAD00101764	You won't escape me!
AAD00101765	You can't hide from me.
AAD00101766	I know where you went.
AAD00101767	By Caesar, I will find you.
AAD00101768	You'd better come out before Leo gets mad!
AAD00101769	ObserveCombat
AAD00101770	Assault noted. Considering intervention.
AAD00101771	An assault has been noted. Analyzing.
AAD00101772	That just ain't necessary
AAD00101773	Kids today.
AAD00101774	Looks like we got us a ruckus.
AAD00101775	Well look at them carrying on.
AAD00101776	I'm not taking sides.
AAD00101777	Whoa!
AAD00101778	Whoa, what's going on?
AAD00101779	Hey, I'm not a part of this.
AAD00101780	Look at 'em go!
AAD00101781	Get 'em! Yeah!
AAD00101782	Keep me out of this!
AAD00101783	Not my problem.
AAD00101784	Hey, some entertainment, finally.
AAD00101785	Hey, cool. A fight.
AAD00101786	Had it coming.
AAD00101787	Fight!
AAD00101788	They hardly even know how to fight.
AAD00101789	Let them fight it out among themselves.

AAD00101807	
AAD00101808	
AAD00101809	Uh... Am I broadcasting? I'm broadcasting? Shit, okay. This is the NCR Emergency channel. It sounds like the Hoover Dam is under attack. Stay tuned.
AAD00101810	
AAD00101811	Post-Gala Villa
AAD00101812	Well, now, I don't know... have you been good to your mommy and daddy?
AAD00101813	The attack is coming from the Omertas. They are using some kind of gas to kill everyone in the casinos on the Strip. How is this possible?
AAD00101814	All units, be aware we are receiving help from a non-NCR military asset.
AAD00101815	
AAD00101816	
AAD00101817	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
AAD00101818	I don't see anything wrong with you.
AAD00101819	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
AAD00101820	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AAD00101821	Let me take a look. Really? That's it? You've got a few scrapes and a hangnail. Come back when you're really hurt.
AAD00101822	You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
AAD00101823	Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
AAD00101824	All right, here's your caps.
AAD00101825	Okay. Hold still.
AAD00101826	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
AAD00101827	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get some medical training.
AAD00101828	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AAD00101829	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
AAD00101830	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
AAD00101831	All right, here's your caps.
AAD00101832	Okay. Hold still.
AAD00101833	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
AAD00101834	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
AAD00101835	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
AAD00101836	Wait here.
AAD00101837	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00101838	<Follow Protocol::Wait>
AAD00101839	Enough about tactics.
AAD00101840	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00101841	<Tactics Interface::Close>
AAD00101842	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
AAD00101843	Sweetie, I think knows a little something about chopping evil people. That's what I've been doing.
AAD00101844	All right, dear, grandma will stay out of your way - but I'll be close enough to hear if you call!
AAD00101845	Wherever you want me. No problem.
AAD00101846	You mean like the last time you told me to do that, boss?
AAD00101847	Got it. I'll be way back here, boss.
AAD00101848	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00101849	<Follow Distance::Far>
AAD00101850	<bark! bark!>
AAD00101851	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
AAD00101852	Let's go.
AAD00101853	Got it.
AAD00101854	Good talk.
AAD00101855	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00101856	<Control Interface::Close>
AAD00101857	Sounds good to me.
AAD00101858	All right, enough jabbering.
AAD00101859	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
AAD00101860	What now?
AAD00101861	Let's hear it.
AAD00101862	Stay close to me.
AAD00101863	Any closer and you'd need a RadAway, boss.
AAD00101864	<bark!>
AAD00101865	About as close as I can get without crawling up your ass.
AAD00101866	Any closer, I'm stepping in your boots.
AAD00101867	Already am... 'less you're getting fresh on me.
AAD00101868	Gonna need a wedding ring first.
AAD00101869	I'm not going to wander off, but okay.
AAD00101870	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
AAD00101871	You're the one who dragged me out of my apartment, so yeah, I'm keeping close. So what?
AAD00101872	[Christine tilts her head slightly.]
AAD00101873	What is it? It won't matter in the end.
AAD00101874	Hnnh?
AAD00101875	Look, if you ripped one, I don't care.
AAD00101876	Washed a hundred times, Brahmin smell never gets out.
AAD00101877	Sorry - travelling the Mojave don't exactly leave me smelling like a rose.
AAD00101878	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00101879	<Follow Distance Protocol::Open>
AAD00101880	What's the matter, dearie? Afraid grandma will embarrass you in front of your little friends?
AAD00101881	I want you to use ranged weapons.
AAD00101882	No arguments from me.
AAD00101883	[Rex is incapable of ranged attacks and will continue using melee attacks.]
AAD00101884	Switch to a melee weapon.
AAD00101885	If you would like me to die very rapidly, this is clearly the best tactical choice.
AAD00101886	Yes! Finally. Everything's coming up Veronica.
AAD00101887	[Rex defaults to melee attacks since he has no ranged weapons.]
AAD00101888	I want you to change your combat style.
AAD00101889	My style suits me just fine. But go ahead anyway.
AAD00101890	It's time for us to part ways.
AAD00101891	<whimper>
AAD00101892	What, no music? I'll hold the tears 'til I'm gone.
AAD00101893	I think we should travel together.
AAD00101894	Lose the second-stringer, and I'll make the time.
AAD00101895	[Christine glances at your companion, shakes her head, then raises her index finger.]
AAD00101896	I'll only travel with you... get rid of the other piece of meat, then we'll talk.
AAD00101897	Nnnn-Nnn... too many, Dog waits until you lose one... maybe let Dog feed?
AAD00101898	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
AAD00101899	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!
AAD00101900	Ooo. Sorry. Don't want to be a third wheel, you know?
AAD00101901	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
AAD00101902	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
AAD00101903	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
AAD00101904	Player agrees to find Stealth Boy stockpile.
AAD00101905	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
AAD00101906	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
AAD00101907	I'll find the Stealth Boy stockpile for you if your kin will leave this place.
AAD00101908	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
AAD00101909	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
AAD00101910	I can find the stockpile of Stealth Boys for you.
AAD00101911	Player asks how to help.
AAD00101912	Good. Antler brought us here for a reason... Why was that, Antler?
AAD00101913	Right! A piece of paper. Shipment invoice. Hundreds of Stealth Boys, sent here a long time ago...
AAD00101914	But Stealth Boys must be in the one room, one we don't search yet - the one we can't search.
AAD00101915	Maybe I can help.
AAD00101916	And who are you, exactly?
AAD00101917	Me? I am devoted to Antler. But before Antler? Hmm...
AAD00101918	Captain, once. Last name, Davison. First name... don't remember.
AAD00101919	I commanded a troop of Nightkin. The Master's elite. A great honor, very proud.
AAD00101920	Something happened. We wandered the desert. Life without Master was... hard. The others' minds going strange, going crazy.
AAD00101921	But then I found us new master. I found us Antler!
AAD00101922	Since then, everything's been going really well.
AAD00101923	The Stealth Boys were sent here by mistake, then sent back.
AAD00101924	But invoice note said Stealth Boys were here! Why can't that note be true?
AAD00101925	What, Antler? ...But human could be lying! Stealing the Stealth Boys for itself!
AAD00101926	Oh, Antler... You trust so easy...
AAD00101927	Your lucky day, human. Antler believe you. Nightkin will follow the new note to find Stealth Boys. Better be there.
AAD00101928	StartCombatResponse
AAD00101929	Engaging.
AAD00101930	Entering combat.
AAD00101931	Use of force authorized.
AAD00101932	God protect me!
AAD00101933	Lord, make me thy instrument!
AAD00101934	God and liberty!
AAD00101935	Got you.
AAD00101936	Let's end this.
AAD00101937	End of the road.
AAD00101938	We'll see what you stand for.
AAD00101939	Tell me more about the souvenir rockets.
AAD00101940	They're scale replicas of the real thing. Very detailed. Got a liquid in them that makes them glow.
AAD00101941	From what I hear, REPCONN used to give them out on tours of their HQ up in Henderson.
AAD00101942	But I guess they had to stop after the first few kids thought they were filled with Nuka-Cola and drank it down.
AAD00101943	The papers had a name for the condition and everything. They called it the "REPCONN Shakes." Those were bad times for RobCo.
AAD00101944	PC reports that Nightkin are gone
AAD00101945	Praise the creator! And bless you, wanderer! The way is clear. I will lead my flock through the basement to the sacred site!
AAD00101946	I hope you will come find us there, wanderer! There is much to be done.
AAD00101947	The "demons" are gone.
AAD00101948	PC agrees to help
AAD00101949	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
AAD00101950	With the underground rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
AAD00101951	I've already killed your "demons."
AAD00101952	PC asks about the Nightkin
AAD00101953	Yes, over the intercom. Threats of death should we step outside, guarantees of safety should we stay locked away.
AAD00101954	It went on for hours, and did not always make sense. But that was the first day only. Since then, silence.
AAD00101955	Will you drive away the demons, wanderer?
AAD00101956	You say one of the demons "raved" at you?
AAD00101957	Yes, wanderer?
AAD00101958	About those "demons"...
AAD00101959	JasonBrightSpeech4
AAD00101960	The Journey ahead would have been impossible if not for the intercession of two human friends, one new, the other a long-abiding companion.
AAD00101961	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs? It would explain the glow and the illnesses.
AAD00101962	[SUCCEEDED] I, ah, well I don't really know. Would that sour you on buying one if it did?
AAD00101963	Come with me. There's something you should see, in front of the dinosaur.
AAD00101964	As long as we don't go out too far. Jeannie May would have a fit if she saw me out and about.
AAD00101965	You seem to be worked up about something. I suppose I can hear you out.
AAD00101966	What's the quickest way out of this dump?
AAD00101967	You can jump out the window, for all I care, lady.
AAD00101968	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
AAD00101969	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
AAD00101970	We haven't met yet.
AAD00101971	Oh, what am I doing? I got to thinking about making a good impression and plain forgot to tell you my name.
AAD00101972	I'm Jeannie May. I take care of folks here at the motel. Long as they aren't troublemakers.
AAD00101973	I'd like to buy all of your remaining rocket souvenirs.
AAD00101974	Really? I never thought I'd see the day.
AAD00101975	I mean... the day I'd part with them for such an incredibly low price. With so many other offers flooding in.
AAD00101976	But I like you. I think maybe it's time. All that's left is in the storage room here. You can buy the key from my store.
AAD00101977	PC hands over one or more souvenirs
AAD00101978	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
AAD00101979	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all that's needed now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
AAD00101980	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
AAD00101981	<Lie> The attackers are all dead too. It's impossible to identify them.
AAD00101982	[SUCCEEDED] Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AAD00101983	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
AAD00101984	[SUCCEEDED] Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AAD00101985	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
AAD00101986	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
AAD00101987	Members of Caesar's Legion ambushed them.
AAD00101988	Those were good men at that station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AAD00101989	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
AAD00101990	Those were good men at that station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
AAD00101991	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
AAD00101992	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
AAD00101993	Your body is injured, not your mind. You're kidding yourself if you think you're useless.
AAD00101994	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. People don't exactly line up to find out what's in my head. Can't remember the last time someone suggested I knew something worth knowing.
AAD00101995	You know, maybe there's something I can do for you. Since you've gone to all the trouble of flattering a crippled old soldier.
AAD00101996	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
AAD00101997	Let me show you how it's done.
AAD00101998	Let's talk about something else.
AAD00101999	<Laughs> Yeah. I'm with you there.
AAD00102000	You're with the NCR, right?
AAD00102001	Was. Was with them. That was back when my arm and leg used to work better.
AAD00102002	I still like to pretend I'm a Ranger, though. I'll check in with the guys up at the station pretty regular on the ham radio.
AAD00102003	Sometimes they stop by, tell me they're paying their respects, the smug bastards.
AAD00102004	They haven't been responding to me, last couple days. I guess they got tired of hearing me talk, but it's still got me a little worried.
AAD00102005	Hell, listen to me talk. Like some damn mother hen.
AAD00102006	CliffBriscoeBarterCheck
AAD00102007	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, I admit it. They've been collecting dust since before I got here. You can have them dirt cheap.
AAD00102008	You don't have any offers for the rockets. You'd be lucky to get money at all.
AAD00102009	Jeannie May sent me.
AAD00102010	Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
AAD00102011	They see the sign and think, gift shop? That's just too good to be true. But Jeannie May always points them back in my direction.
AAD00102012	Well, a friend of Jeannie's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
AAD00102013	I think I might be addicted to something.
AAD00102014	Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
AAD00102015	I can't say that's something I treat all the time, but I should have something to help you through it.
AAD00102016	Sure. I can help you out.
AAD00102017	His story didn't add up.
AAD00102018	You didn't have any proof?
AAD00102019	His story didn't add up.
AAD00102020	You didn't have any proof?
AAD00102021	Her story didn't add up.
AAD00102022	Just a hunch.
AAD00102023	You didn't have any proof?
AAD00102024	We'll kill more with two of us.
AAD00102025	Yeah. That might be true. And that's reason enough for me to take you up on it, I suppose. But this isn't gonna end well.
AAD00102026	Snipers work better in pairs.
AAD00102027	Hnh. Yeah. Working on your own, you're a lot less effective. I've been there and paid for it.
AAD00102028	But this isn't gonna end well.
AAD00102029	I thought snipers worked in teams.
AAD00102030	What's the news?
AAD00102031	I can't imagine that deputy of theirs is worth more than a spit. I was on lookout when he got frog marched over to Bison Steve.
AAD00102032	If I had a long rifle or the order I would have taken out the Powder Gangers to save him, but I didn't. His tough shit I guess.
AAD00102033	I rescued Primm's deputy, but the town's still lawless.
AAD00102034	PC asks Hayes to establish law in Primm
AAD00102035	Yeah, I just got word of that. There's a squad of rangers standing by.
AAD00102036	Sergeant McGee will take over as sheriff and the rangers will be his deputies. This town will be an NCR territory.
AAD00102037	This means that aside from protection, the citizens will also need to become registered NCR citizens and pay any appropriate and associated taxes.
AAD00102038	I got extra troop support for Primm.
AAD00102039	That ranger squad is still standing by, and McGee is anxious to take over as sheriff. Are you ready for me to make the call?
AAD00102040	I want to talk about the NCR protecting Primm.
AAD00102041	What are you doing out here?
AAD00102042	We were sent out here to hold back the tide of convicts from the correctional facility.
AAD00102043	As you can probably tell, we aren't doing the kind of job we could be doing.
AAD00102044	What are you doing out here?
AAD00102045	Do you have anything for sale?
AAD00102046	Well, yes and no. My shop's got plenty of stock.
AAD00102047	Problem is I ain't going into my shop until I know it's good and safe.
AAD00102048	What happened to Primm?
AAD00102049	Let's see. Been tough around here for a good while now. Worse since them thugs kidnapped our deputy.
AAD00102050	It started with the breakout from prison up the road. First there was just a few thugs rolling through town, but then they got organized.
AAD00102051	Now they call themselves Powder Gangsters or something, and run around throwing dynamite and shooting people.
AAD00102052	Little while ago a good chunk of them left whatever kind of organization they got up there to squeeze all the food and drink out of us they could.
AAD00102053	What's going on in Primm?
AAD00102054	Got a new sheriff, as you know. Meyers's a bit rougher-hewn than I might've liked, but he seems like a good sort. So far, so good.
AAD00102055	How's Primm these days?
AAD00102056	I have a bunch.
AAD00102057	Is that right? Then hand 'em over and I'll get to baking a whole batch of casseroles!
AAD00102058	I have a bunch of radscorpion glands.
AAD00102059	I have 3 glands.
AAD00102060	Hand 'em over and I'll get to baking!
AAD00102061	I've got a few radscorpion glands.
AAD00102062	I have 1 radscorpion gland.
AAD00102063	One's enough to make a helping. Hand it over!
AAD00102064	I have one radscorpion gland.
AAD00102065	HVRamosFanboy
AAD00102066	You don't. Ever. You don't even think about it.
AAD00102067	Even if we did recruit trespassers, you're far too old for us. Your relationship to technology has already been perverted.
AAD00102068	How do I join the Brotherhood of Steel?
AAD00102069	The password is "Lives to fight another day."
AAD00102070	[You hear static.]
AAD00102071	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
AAD00102072	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look you over. Oh, and welcome back.
AAD00102073	ChrisHavNovacConfessSabotage
AAD00102074	You bastard! Those ghouls declared me a Saint!
AAD00102075	I sabotaged the rockets.
AAD00102076	HVRangerRadioDestroyed
AAD00102077	You did not just destroy my radio.
AAD00102078	HVRangerIntroSpeech
AAD00102079	[FAILED] I'll point my rifle at anything and anyone I please to! Got that, Powder Ganger?
AAD00102080	Don't point! It's rude! Especially with guns!
AAD00102081	I'm not a Powder Ganger!
AAD00102082	Relax, son. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?
AAD00102083	I'm not a Powder Ganger!
AAD00102084	I'm not a Powder Ganger.
AAD00102085	Exactly what Powder Ganger scum would say! Any last words before I pull this trigger?
AAD00102086	Did you have anything to do with Boone's wife's disappearance?
AAD00102087	Believe me. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I owe somebody. Big. I figured Boone would come around after a while.
AAD00102088	But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her, things will never go back to the way they were.
AAD00102089	RSCharlieAudioLog2Audio
AAD00102090	This is a message to the NCR from the Legion.
AAD00102091	We are coming for you. Run, and we will catch you. Hide, and we will find you. No matter what you do, you are all going to die.
AAD00102092	We took one of the women alive.
AAD00102093	I need medical supplies.
AAD00102094	Yeah, and I need sterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
AAD00102095	What else do you know about the deaths at the corral?
AAD00102096	I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me.
AAD00102097	He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground.
AAD00102098	Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible.
AAD00102099	Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it.
AAD00102100	Walked right past me having an argument with somebody.
AAD00102101	But I only saw one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.
AAD00102102	What's been going on in town?
AAD00102103	There's been things of a disturbing nature going on at the McBride Corral.
AAD00102104	Seems every night one of their herd meets a most unnatural death, and always there's holes all over the body.
AAD00102105	Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don't pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there's bullets in them.
AAD00102106	Well, says No-bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we're in.
AAD00102107	Who do you think is actually at the factory?
AAD00102108	Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.
AAD00102109	Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
AAD00102110	I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes.
AAD00102111	Although, being a scientist, I have to admit I might've just blinked for longer than usual, what with the shock of seeing a commie ghost and so forth.
AAD00102112	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, missy, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
AAD00102113	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
AAD00102114	No one is going to attack your corral from now on.
AAD00102115	Well we surely appreciate what you done for us. Even without our stock, just having peace of mind means the world to us.
AAD00102116	Take this, compliments of Alice and myself. We'd give you more if we could, knowing you risked your neck for us.
AAD00102117	Did you get a look at the attacker?
AAD00102118	Beg your pardon ma'am, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
AAD00102119	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
AAD00102120	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
AAD00102121	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they've taken to shooting from the west side.
AAD00102122	How did you end up trapped down here?
AAD00102123	First off, I'm not trapped. This was a tactical choice, all right?
AAD00102124	I'm no match for those things out there, so I found a good defensive position, and I've been defending it, right?
AAD00102125	...Aw, who am I fooling? I'm trapped. Name's Harland. Pleased to meet you.
AAD00102126	What happened was, I was escorting folks down to work when those things attacked us.
AAD00102127	Most of the fight was upstairs, but some folks panicked and made for the basement. And I went after them.
AAD00102128	Well, turns out there were even more of those bastards down here than upstairs, and things went to shit fast.
AAD00102129	I couldn't find the others, so I fell back to this room and set up a nice little kill zone. End of story.
AAD00102130	You don't look like the other ghouls from Bright's group.
AAD00102131	Guess the outfit gives that away, huh? I never did buy into that religious mumbo-jumbo with the robes and all that shit.
AAD00102132	It gets lonely out in the wastes, okay? And I don't have to tell you that Bright's group has got some fine-looking ghoulettes in it!
AAD00102133	Eh... or maybe I would have to tell you...
AAD00102134	Anyway, I helped them out, and they kept me supplied with ammo and pleasant company.
AAD00102135	JNashAboutLaw
AAD00102136	Well, you can call Beagle a deputy so long as you don't harbor too high an opinion of the word.
AAD00102137	Boy was 'bout as useful as tits on a radscorpion. Only qualification he ever had was to be brother to the wife of the sheriff.
AAD00102138	Still, I s'pose he don't deserve what's befell him. We would've considered paying the ransom, if we'd had caps to spare.
AAD00102139	You say Powder Gangers kidnapped Primm's deputy?
AAD00102140	SammyNeverHeardofYou
AAD00102141	Simple! Up until now, we committed our crimes stealthily, leaving no evidence behind. So we never built a rep.
AAD00102142	But that's gonna change with our next score. You just wait and see.
AAD00102143	You sound pretty tough. I wonder why I've never heard of you.
AAD00102144	BeagleSheriffBeagle
AAD00102145	Oh, no! I'm just the deputy. And I can't be a deputy without a sheriff. It's called chain of command!
AAD00102146	What are you talking about? You're the sheriff now!
AAD00102147	BeagleSheriffThanks
AAD00102148	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AAD00102149	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that - all new.
AAD00102150	He's rude. Don't tell him I said it. Primm has a sheriff now, just not as supportive as I would've hoped.
AAD00102151	What's your problem now?
AAD00102152	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AAD00102153	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that: all new.
AAD00102154	He's a good sheriff but a hard man. He doesn't abide by anyone slinking by the rules. I guess there won't be any trouble, but the man's law is hard.
AAD00102155	What's your problem now?
AAD00102156	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
AAD00102157	Slim is alright, I don't wish him no harm, but the law to him is a set of logic.
AAD00102158	Not everything is black and white, not sure a robot can ever understand that.
AAD00102159	What's your problem now?
AAD00102160	Chris said you might know where I can find computer parts.
AAD00102161	He did, did he? I swear, I should tear the rest of the hair out of that cocksucker's head.
AAD00102162	Send a rescue mission after Harland? Nah, let's just send some smoothskin whose radio got broke!
AAD00102163	Harland's tough! He probably enjoys waiting to be attacked at any moment! He probably loves eating nothing but roach meat!
AAD00102164	Licking up condensation from a rusted pipe is his idea of fun! So's doing business in a corner, and smelling it for days!
AAD00102165	But oh, that's right - the crisis is that you need some computer parts! Well, you can go fuck yourself until you get my friends out of this mess.
AAD00102166	Can you heal my radiation?
AAD00102167	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
AAD00102168	Well, one thing we do have is a good supply of RadAway. Sure, I can help you with that.
AAD00102169	We always make sure to keep an ample supply of RadAway. Most of us haven't had the exposure outsiders like you take for granted.
AAD00102170	I killed Jeannie May. Do I still get my discount?
AAD00102171	Ki- killed her? Why would you do something like that?
AAD00102172	What do you think of the people who live here?
AAD00102173	Oh, we keep to ourselves, for the most part. Try not to pry. I think Jeannie May gets bothered that we aren't more sociable, but it's just our way.
AAD00102174	Ain't that we don't appreciate what she's done, managing this town like she has, but I worry she feels that way anyhow.
AAD00102175	Not that there ain't others who pry around here. That No-bark was skulking around our yard last week.
AAD00102176	<Laughs> I thought he was our cow-killer. Was about to lash him with our bullwhip till I saw who it was. He's harmless, though.
AAD00102177	Part of me wishes I could see things like he sees 'em, all full of mystery.
AAD00102178	I just wanted to meet you.
AAD00102179	We set up this ranch years back when Novac was just getting settled.
AAD00102180	But now with all the danger on I-15, folks are starting to come through here from all over. Novac might just be the next Nevada boom town.
AAD00102181	Have you lived here a long time?
AAD00102182	I have some Stealth Boys. I could give them to you.
AAD00102183	Antler brings us here for hundreds of Stealth Boys, human. Antler thinks big. Antler IS big.
AAD00102184	Antler don't bring us here for Stealth Boys some puny human carry. Pull head out of your ass.
AAD00102185	PC says what he's doing here.
AAD00102186	A stash of Stealth Boys. Are you kidding me?
AAD00102187	If there was some big stash of devices in here that made you invisible, do you really think we'd be having this conversation?
AAD00102188	I'm looking for a stash of Stealth Boys in this room.
AAD00102189	PC asks about the Great Journey
AAD00102190	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
AAD00102191	Are these surface-to-surface rockets? Or will they launch you into orbit?
AAD00102192	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
AAD00102193	Those rockets will convey you and your flock straight into the ground!
AAD00102194	JasonBrightWhoAreYou
AAD00102195	I am Jason Bright, the prophet of the Great Journey. All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
AAD00102196	Who are you?
AAD00102197	JasonBrightSpeech6
AAD00102198	But to Chris, we owe more than thanks. Chris, you have made this Great Journey a reality.
AAD00102199	JasonBrightSpeech5
AAD00102200	To our new friend, we say thanks, and promise never to forget how he cleared from our path the demons who sought to stay our Journey.
AAD00102201	RNashCasserole
AAD00102202	My specialty is a radscorpion venom casserole. It's more appetizing than it sounds!
AAD00102203	The venom has a sharp, smokey flavor, and it numbs your mouth so fierce you'll forget you ever had a tongue!
AAD00102204	It's perfectly safe, long as you don't have sores in your mouth for the venom to find your blood. 'Cause that'll kill you dead.
AAD00102205	What do you cook?
AAD00102206	PrimmNCRSheriffConvo
AAD00102207	Okay, we have some soldiers heading to town now. I'll have them sweep the Bison Steve before they start regular patrols.
AAD00102208	You pay me a stack of caps right now and I'll forget you have my job.
AAD00102209	[SUCCEEDED] Aw, man. How am I supposed to buy chems now? Fine. Here.
AAD00102210	[FAILED] Ha! You had me going for a second there. Then I remembered that there's only one Fantastic. I'm king of this dump.
AAD00102211	How did you get this job?
AAD00102212	It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
AAD00102213	They asked me if I knew anything about power plants. I said as much as anyone I had ever met.
AAD00102214	They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
AAD00102215	I am now.
AAD00102216	Well hey, if you find yourself up at the mainframe, do yourself a favor and make sure you send the power to the right place.
AAD00102217	It needs to go to the Strip and McCarran.
AAD00102218	How would someone retarget the mirrors?
AAD00102219	There's these two terminals outside. They control the mirrors. I tried fooling with them but didn't get very far.
AAD00102220	You'd have to get them to talk to the mainframe up in the tower, then do the rest from up there. I'm guessing. But it sounds good, right?
AAD00102221	Hey, you're not thinking about going up there, are you?
AAD00102222	What exactly do you do?
AAD00102223	Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers. Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
AAD00102224	Like one time I imagined they were a code to get into a vault full of naked women. Man, how cool would that be?
AAD00102225	Player turns the deputy loose
AAD00102226	Oh, that's just marvelous. I think I'll be making my way outside now. The air's a little close in here.
AAD00102227	I'll set you free now.
AAD00102228	Okay then, let's talk about something else.
AAD00102229	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
AAD00102230	Just mosey on over to the display case and you'll see it plain as day. Quite a piece, that gun. Mint condition. Never fired.
AAD00102231	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
AAD00102232	Tell me about the Vikki and Vance.
AAD00102233	Tell me about Primm.
AAD00102234	I convinced Pauline that you shouldn't go through with this.
AAD00102235	Really? Oh, thank god! I love that woman, but I swear this time she was gonna get us killed!
AAD00102236	The gun's in the safe. The combination's 05-23-34. Take it far away from here, before she changes her mind.
AAD00102237	Pauline says you should give me the gun.
AAD00102238	Charm Pauline into Rethinking their plan.
AAD00102239	[SUCCEEDED] Really? You think so? We've only got the one gun, and there's two of us... and we've never done anything like this before...
AAD00102240	We've never been on the Strip, either, so we don't know how many guards the casinos have. And I kept having these nightmares...
AAD00102241	What are we thinking? We're gonna get ourselves killed!
AAD00102242	Look, tell Sammy to give you the gun, all right? Just take it! I don't want it around, tempting us to do something stupid!
AAD00102243	That's the greatest plan I've ever heard in my entire life.
AAD00102244	Shouldn't there be more people than this defending a power plant?
AAD00102245	There should. But we're not getting much power out of it so none of our enemies have big interest in it either. Not like Hoover Dam, anyway.
AAD00102246	We had a real fighting force here just long enough to take it from the Brotherhood of Steel. Then they got sent east to the dam like everybody else.
AAD00102247	Caesar's Legion sends skirmishers every so often. Prodding for weaknesses, mostly. The reality is, if they really wanted it, we'd all be dead.
AAD00102248	<Lie> I heard my brother was stationed here. I want to know he's okay.
AAD00102249	I notice your solar tower isn't collecting much sunlight. I can help.
AAD00102250	No need. We already have an expert hard at work on it.
AAD00102251	Then again... our expert is an idiot. Hell, he might as well be a saboteur. I guess you couldn't do any worse.
AAD00102252	Have him fill you in on the details. He's in the back of the building. You'll know him when you see him.
AAD00102253	Keeps his sunglasses on all the time, even when he's sleeping.
AAD00102254	<Attack> I'm taking over.
AAD00102255	We've held off tougher enemies than you.
AAD00102256	[SUCCEEDED] Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
AAD00102257	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
AAD00102258	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
AAD00102259	<Lie> I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
AAD00102260	[FAILED] That uniform's got an awful lot of blood on it, soldier, and you don't look injured to me. Doesn't fit you so well either.
AAD00102261	You're trying to put one over on the wrong trooper.
AAD00102262	I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
AAD00102263	Peace.
AAD00102264	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AAD00102265	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AAD00102266	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AAD00102267	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AAD00102268	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AAD00102269	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AAD00102270	I want what you want.
AAD00102271	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
AAD00102272	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
AAD00102273	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
AAD00102274	My only true allegiance is to myself.
AAD00102275	Then for everyone's sake, I hope you serve a worthy master. Are you a maker of war, or peace?
AAD00102276	I'm in the Brotherhood of Steel.
AAD00102277	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here.
AAD00102278	I'm a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse, and for once, we might want the same thing.
AAD00102279	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
AAD00102280	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here. For once, our organizations may want the same thing.
AAD00102281	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
AAD00102282	I serve Caesar.
AAD00102283	I'm with the NCR.
AAD00102284	This is your turf. For all I know you could have me killed for my allegiance. Who are you with?
AAD00102285	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. Yes. I'm part of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
AAD00102286	If you're not familiar, we seek peace and the spread of knowledge. Knowledge that must never be lost to the world.
AAD00102287	Now your turn.
AAD00102288	JNashHowLaw
AAD00102289	Well I guess you're gonna have to find us a new lawman.
AAD00102290	I suggest talking to those NCR troopers across the bridge. I also overheard the Powder Gangsters talking about some ex-sheriff on lockdown there.
AAD00102291	Your deputy died in Bison Steve.
AAD00102292	Right now Beagle is the closest Primm's got to any organized law, but he's still stuck up in Bison Steve.
AAD00102293	First thing I'd say is get his sorry butt outta there.
AAD00102294	What can I do to help Primm?
AAD00102295	JNashAboutVikkiVance
AAD00102296	That's where we are. This here little casino brought some cash and bodies into the town before them Powder Gangsters came in.
AAD00102297	They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in a kind of box canyon. Guess this is a fitting place for that as any.
AAD00102298	I reckon that if they thought hard enough about it, they'd realize they got more bodies than we have bullets, but for now we're safe enough in here.
AAD00102299	What's at Vikki and Vance?
AAD00102300	Do all of the brothers use this equipment?
AAD00102301	Everyone in the base has to spend a minimum of five hours a week running tactical simulations, but outside that, interest is scarce.
AAD00102302	It wasn't always this way. When we first moved into the bunker, everyone was so excited that the VR systems were intact.
AAD00102303	Over time, though, my fellows have become listless and less entertained by the wonders of technology around us.
AAD00102304	That's why Apprentice Watkins is such a joy to work with. Her unbridled enthusiasm for virtual combat is unparalleled.
AAD00102305	LtHayesPrisonAttackFail
AAD00102306	That explains why there's been no sit-rep from Sergeant Lee.
AAD00102307	It took months to get authorization for that assault. It'll be a long time before we take on the Powder Gangers again.
AAD00102308	The attack on the prison was a failure.
AAD00102309	BMRaulJoinMe
AAD00102310	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
AAD00102311	Actually, do you want to tag along with me?
AAD00102312	It would be safer to run and find someplace to hide.
AAD00102313	Maybe you're right. Come on, boys, let's get the hell out of here before the law shows up.
AAD00102314	REPCONHQSpeech
AAD00102315	[SUCCEEDED] Please do not make your way to the 2nd floor.
AAD00102316	I am not supposed to go upstairs, let me pass and I won't.
AAD00102317	[FAILED] Unauthorized access. You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102318	I've worked here for years. I forgot my badge at home.
AAD00102319	Let's do it.
AAD00102320	Here's the plan. The gate to Tabitha's compound is guarded by several Nightkin, all of them using devices that make them invisible.
AAD00102321	I'm going to draw them away from the gate by telling them I spotted an intruder in the village. Then you slip in.
AAD00102322	REPCONHQSpeech3
AAD00102323	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you. sir. Have a nice day.
AAD00102324	ICE CREAM!
AAD00102325	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you, ma'am. Have a nice day.
AAD00102326	ICE CREAM!
AAD00102327	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you, ma'am. Have a nice day.
AAD00102328	Ice Cream.
AAD00102329	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.
AAD00102330	Ice Cream.
AAD00102331	REPCONHQSpeech4
AAD00102332	[FAILED] No maintenance service request logged. Intruder alert!
AAD00102333	I'm here to fix the broken wall.
AAD00102334	Tell me about RobCo.
AAD00102335	RobCo Industries purchased REPCONN in 2075 to assist with some of RobCo's military projects, as well as developing unmanned space exploration.
AAD00102336	The relationship between RobCo and REPCONN is mutually beneficial, and we hope that both companies bolster each other well into the next century.
AAD00102337	REPCONHQTourStation
AAD00102338	And in front of me is a model - not actual size - of the launch dome we are using to send our rockets screeeeaming into orbit.
AAD00102339	REPCONHQTourStation01
AAD00102340	In the lead-lined case behind me is a spent radioactive rod from one of our old reactors. No need to stand too close, let's move along, shall we?
AAD00102341	188ClayMedicineBuy
AAD00102342	Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head, but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
AAD00102343	I might be interested in buying your "headache medicine." How much?
AAD00102344	188ClayThoughtsSmallPicture
AAD00102345	I need to take off my medicine...
AAD00102346	Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
AAD00102347	With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say.
AAD00102348	Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship.
AAD00102349	Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
AAD00102350	Do your thinking about "Here."
AAD00102351	188ClayThoughtsBigPicture
AAD00102352	Let me take off my medicine...
AAD00102353	Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets.
AAD00102354	All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know.
AAD00102355	Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
AAD00102356	Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
AAD00102357	Do your thinking about "Everywhere."
AAD00102358	188ClayThoughtsPlayer
AAD00102359	Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
AAD00102360	Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
AAD00102361	You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? But how?
AAD00102362	Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
AAD00102363	A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. Sorry if I said anything weird.
AAD00102364	Do your thinking about me.
AAD00102365	188ClayPayForThoughts
AAD00102366	That's all right, mister. You will someday.
AAD00102367	Sounds interesting... I don't have 100 caps, though.
AAD00102368	That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
AAD00102369	Sounds interesting... I don't have 100 caps, though.
AAD00102370	188AlexanderSeeInventory
AAD00102371	[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
AAD00102372	Take a look.
AAD00102373	I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear.
AAD00102374	Okay. Here.
AAD00102375	Thanks. We're leaving now, we don't want no more trouble.
AAD00102376	I don't have that many caps.
AAD00102377	Alright, since you look new and didn't know better, we'll cut you some slack. 50 caps.
AAD00102378	BMTabithaDishHutRadioFan
AAD00102379	Why, thank you! It's always gratifying to talk to one's fans. Hold on, I have something I need to do for a second.
AAD00102380	Aren't you the Super Mutant from the radio? I'm a huge fan.
AAD00102381	What will you do now?
AAD00102382	I don't know... it's been so long since I lost Rhonda, that I'm not sure...
AAD00102383	BMRhondaGreeting
AAD00102384	Hello. Could you please direct me to Mistress Tabitha?
AAD00102385	I wonder what Mistress Tabitha has been doing with herself during my convalescence.
AAD00102386	It is so good to be traveling with Mistress Tabitha again!
AAD00102387	You say that Super Mutants were *made*?
AAD00102388	RadioBMSegment04
AAD00102389	[Rhonda] <unnerved> Not the dreaded battle cattle training to hunt mutants?
AAD00102390	Something like that. Are you an NCR soldier?
AAD00102391	Hell yes, sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
AAD00102392	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
AAD00102393	Hell yes, ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
AAD00102394	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
AAD00102395	REPCONHQGoodBye
AAD00102396	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102397	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102398	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102399	Sorry, I was just leaving.
AAD00102400	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102401	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102402	Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
AAD00102403	What will you do now?
AAD00102404	I still have a job to do here. Some Mutants may have heard Tabitha's broadcasts and are headed here even as we speak.
AAD00102405	I'll remain and direct any one who show up toward Jacobstown, where they'll be much better off.
AAD00102406	Punk? That's my line.
AAD00102407	Are you deserters?
AAD00102408	I like to think that we're Prisoners Of War that managed to escape before capture.
AAD00102409	I don't know how long it'll be before the Legion crosses the river, but sure as fuck I don't want to be wearing an NCR uniform when they get here.
AAD00102410	You're right. You're totally screwed.
AAD00102411	I'm here to provide support. Is there anything I might be able to help with?
AAD00102412	Hmm... you don't cook by any chance, do you? Farber's doing his best, but it's hard to manage an army with half my staff in line for the latrine.
AAD00102413	Honestly, we're fighting a lot of fires right now. The Fiends keep pressing their position from Vault 3.
AAD00102414	We've got the Legion breathing down our necks across the river. We actually took an officer alive last week, but so far he hasn't spoken a word.
AAD00102415	I'm up for hire if you need some extra manpower around the base.
AAD00102416	There are a lot of things I can't spare troops for right now. If you can help us, we can definitely pay you for your work.
AAD00102417	I bet I could make the Legion prisoner talk.
AAD00102418	I have Lieutenant Boyd on that already, and she's excellent. But I think she's hit a wall.
AAD00102419	Talk to her, if you like. See if she has any use for you.
AAD00102420	Her office is right above mine, but I think she might be interrogating right now. So she'd be upstairs on the other side of the building.
AAD00102421	Goodbye.
AAD00102422	Wrong turn? Happens all the time. Do they give me a secretary? Of course not.
AAD00102423	You won't be having problems with intelligence leaks anymore.
AAD00102424	I know who bombed the monorail.
AAD00102425	What? Who?
AAD00102426	All right. I'll do it.
AAD00102427	Good. No need to check in with the NCR authorities, I can authorize your payment from OSI accounts.
AAD00102428	Vaults typically contain a server room on a lower level, where they would have backed up their research data. A computer room, you understand?
AAD00102429	Download all the information on the central server to your Pip-Boy. And you'll be certain to bring me any notes or samples that you find, won't you?
AAD00102430	I'm listening.
AAD00102431	Imagine, if you will, the wasteland in bloom... vast fields of corn that grow from seeds and produce their bounty in the space of a month...
AAD00102432	...orchards of trees, their branches weighed halfway to the ground, hung with fat, ripe oranges. A harvest that could feed a city... or a nation.
AAD00102433	And all of this... all this, requiring no more than a few drops of precious water, and the efforts of only a handful of human farmers. Impossible?
AAD00102434	He confessed it to me before he died. He used the word "frumentarius."
AAD00102435	[SUCCEEDED] That's what the Legion calls their spies. I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
AAD00102436	[FAILED] That's not exactly airtight.
AAD00102437	If only we'd caught this sooner, before he got to the monorail...
AAD00102438	Still, this investigation has been valuable to us, and you deserve to be compensated for it.
AAD00102439	The NCR appreciates the work you've done. Will there be anything else?
AAD00102440	Private Crenshaw. He's dead now.
AAD00102441	Crenshaw... I've met Crenshaw. At his disciplinary hearing. Still, this is hard to imagine - he was just a prankster.
AAD00102442	I've been fighting for the wrong side. Let me prove myself to you.
AAD00102443	[FAILED] Forget it. We have no use for you here.
AAD00102444	We don't have much to go on right now. Lately every raiding party in New Vegas seems to have a map of our troop movements.
AAD00102445	It derails everything. Supplies, reinforcements. And it'll only get worse, the longer we let it go on.
AAD00102446	Captain Curtis is heading up the investigation right now. He can fill you in.
AAD00102447	I'll go to Vault 3 and see if I can find your ranger.
AAD00102448	That Vault is a hornet's nest. If you have second thoughts, no one would think less of you for it. But if you can get him home, it'd mean a lot.
AAD00102449	Watch for civilians, too. The Fiends have been kidnapping locals. They just walk right into people's homes in the middle of the day and take them.
AAD00102450	But the man you're looking for is Bryce Anders. Anders was trying to find the leader, Motor-Runner.
AAD00102451	You hear something like a chainsaw, you've found Motor-Runner. Put a bullet in his head, and you'll have some new friends around here.
AAD00102452	I'd be careful with that data. You didn't see those plants in the Vault.
AAD00102453	Your concerns are perfectly understandable, but I assure you, they're entirely misplaced. We would never use technology that wasn't fully tested.
AAD00102454	We aren't some motley band of Vault alchemists. We're with the government, for goodness sake. Have a little faith in us!
AAD00102455	No problem. I can wait.
AAD00102456	I think... Williams' decryption algorithms seem to be working...
AAD00102457	Yes... here it is! The data is mostly uncorrupted. This will make the board of directors finally sit up and take notice...
AAD00102458	Here, then... as promised. An agreeable sum, payable upon delivery of the data. You've more than done your part.
AAD00102459	I've brought the data from Vault 22.
AAD00102460	Wonderful! Excellent work! Let me see it... it'll take a moment to decode on my terminal...
AAD00102461	Goodbye.
AAD00102462	Yes... goodbye.
AAD00102463	What can you tell me about this place?
AAD00102464	What are you looking to find out?
AAD00102465	The monorail is destroyed.
AAD00102466	I've got connections. Maybe we could make an arrangement?
AAD00102467	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
AAD00102468	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash, and at a discount.
AAD00102469	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
AAD00102470	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
AAD00102471	I've got caps. Name your price.
AAD00102472	I can be pretty resourceful. Perhaps we could work out a deal?
AAD00102473	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
AAD00102474	Come on, man. Hook me up.
AAD00102475	What's the hold-up - if you don't mind my asking?
AAD00102476	What's it look like? I caught one in the leg. I killed a dozen of those degenerates sneaking my way in, but... one got a drop on me.
AAD00102477	I holed up here after I killed that one. They're too stupid to unlock the doors, so I knew they'd figure whoever attacked had just taken off.
AAD00102478	I just need a day or two, then I'll take out Motor-Runner myself. I even got his key to the Maintenance Wing. Situation's under control.
AAD00102479	SPEECH attempt to convince Bryce to help take out Motor-Runner
AAD00102480	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight.
AAD00102481	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
AAD00102482	Well, this whole thing's improvised, and now we'll have to improvise some more and find another way through. I'll follow you down.
AAD00102483	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
AAD00102484	What is this place?
AAD00102485	This was Vault 3, but I'm sure you can tell that by all the 3s all over the damn place. Now it's a drug den for the goddamn Fiends.
AAD00102486	What can you tell me about what happened here?
AAD00102487	The Fiends killed everyone living here, and now they're squatting in their home.
AAD00102488	Do you need any help?
AAD00102489	Yeah, so far this has gone exactly as expected - poorly. But with the work you've done for NCR already, you might be just what I've been looking for.
AAD00102490	We captured an honest-to-God centurion of Caesar's Legion recently.
AAD00102491	I have a doctor's bag right here. It should be enough to get you on your feet.
AAD00102492	What are you waiting for? I've got a high-value target to kill!
AAD00102493	<Lie> I'm an independent contractor with the NCR.
AAD00102494	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my apologies sir. I was sent here by Colonel Hsu to exterminate Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
AAD00102495	I'll see what I can find out about Cpl. White for you.
AAD00102496	Word around the base is he'd been going regularly to visit a hooker named Dazzle at Gomorrah. That's a casino on the Strip. Classy place.
AAD00102497	His belongings are up in the barracks in the concourse building. First bunk on your left if you're facing it from the center.
AAD00102498	I haven't had a chance to look through his things yet, so that might be a good place to begin.
AAD00102499	You said there have been thefts?
AAD00102500	Not the kind of things you like to see go missing.
AAD00102501	No witnesses yet. I've got my money on Sergeant Contreras, who's supposed to be in charge of distribution, the little weasel.
AAD00102502	But he's too slick to let anyone catch him doing it. We've searched his possessions a dozen times. Nothing.
AAD00102503	I didn't come here to do your job for you.
AAD00102504	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing. Maybe you'll brave up and do the right thing. Good luck.
AAD00102505	So who *did* train you?
AAD00102506	Before the bombs, I might have studied at any number of colleges, universities. They gave a man a chance to advance himself... or so I've heard.
AAD00102507	But after the bombs - until a few years ago - anyone with half a brain had one choice. The Followers of the Apocalypse.
AAD00102508	Didn't matter if you agreed with them or not. You either played along or you were turned away.
AAD00102509	Keely wiped the data. It's gone.
AAD00102510	Now get out of this office. Get out!
AAD00102511	Right... Well, I'll keep that in mind.
AAD00102512	Be sure you do.
AAD00102513	If you get this last job done, full access to my stash. At a discount, even. Just because I like you.
AAD00102514	Get moving, watch out for raiders, and do not lose that package. Good luck.
AAD00102515	I'm ready for the next task.
AAD00102516	Well, I'm not. Come back tomorrow and the stuff will be ready to transport.
AAD00102517	All right, I need you to pass something off to a merchant. The guy's name is Price. The exchange goes down at Miguel's Pawn Shop in Westside.
AAD00102518	This next bit is very important. He's paranoid. Maybe a little schizo. You have to identify yourself with a passcode or he'll shoot you right there.
AAD00102519	Just tell him you're looking for some betting advice. Then he'll say the surest move is to bet on the house.
AAD00102520	<Lie> I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
AAD00102521	[?] No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
AAD00102522	No. Hildern didn't mention anyone else.
AAD00102523	Listen. I make a fair wage, but I'm not rich, not by any means. Maybe my kind of money wouldn't appeal to your average merc.
AAD00102524	But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Ain't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
AAD00102525	What is there to do here?
AAD00102526	Keep your nose to the ground, stranger, that's what. Mind your own business and let us mind our own. Are we clear?
AAD00102527	If you've got a mind to loot the old H&H Tools factory, don't even bother. That place is sealed tighter than a Radscorpion's bunghole.
AAD00102528	Every salvager who tries gets blown up, flattened, or gutted by traps. Then he starts to stink up the town and we're the ones to clean up the mess.
AAD00102529	Don't worry. I paid him off. He won't be a problem.
AAD00102530	You bribed a Ranger? Ha! That's gotta be some kind of special talent.
AAD00102531	Don't worry. He won't be telling anyone anything ever again.
AAD00102532	Good to hear.
AAD00102533	<Hand Contreras the package> Nah, but he is definitely looking for you.
AAD00102534	Thank God. You're going to need to take him out.
AAD00102535	If McCarran hears I've been selling contraband, we're both dead.
AAD00102536	I didn't really have a choice.
AAD00102537	Now you're just going to have to take him out. I can't afford having NCR knowing about my side business...
AAD00102538	...and I don't think you want to go in front of a firing squad either. You take care of this, my entire stock is available to you.
AAD00102539	Hell, I might even throw in something extra to sweeten the deal.
AAD00102540	Price is being held by the NCR. A Ranger replaced him.
AAD00102541	Ah shit. Well, please tell me you didn't hand him the package.
AAD00102542	Just some supplies for McCarran from the Crimson Caravan.
AAD00102543	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
AAD00102544	[FAILED] <Takes Contreras' package> Bullshit, let's see what you've got here...
AAD00102545	Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make chems. You're under arrest unless you've got a damn good explanation.
AAD00102546	<Cover Package> Oh, this? Nothing important.
AAD00102547	Nothing. I was just told he was a local merchant I should check out.
AAD00102548	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
AAD00102549	[FAILED] What's that you're carrying? Looks like some kind of delivery to me...
AAD00102550	Oh, just delivering packages. No clue what's in 'em, but it's really important.
AAD00102551	Well, I was given this package to deliver to him.
AAD00102552	Let's see... Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make full-blown chems.
AAD00102553	Here. Take this package Contreras gave me. I don't want any trouble.
AAD00102554	Okay. I'll just be on my way then.
AAD00102555	
AAD00102556	[SUCCEEDED] It might work since he's acting as a major hub for this activity. It's not like he has much choice now that we have evidence.
AAD00102557	If you can convince Contreras to work with the Rangers to break up the drug ring, I'll call off the firing squad.
AAD00102558	Just report back to me when he's agreed to make the deal. Otherwise, he's dead.
AAD00102559	I'm sure Contreras could work with you.
AAD00102560	C'mon, guy. You're no merchant. You've got Ranger all over you.
AAD00102561	[SUCCEEDED] What?! How the hell did you figure that out?
AAD00102562	[FAILED] Password? That little bastard said nothing about a password.
AAD00102563	Price is in NCR custody and you're going to join him, unless you've got a damn good explanation for why you're looking for him.
AAD00102564	Hand over your weapons. You're under arrest.
AAD00102565	Hey, that wasn't the right response for the password!
AAD00102566	<Draw Weapon> You won't be telling anyone about this.
AAD00102567	Heh, an accomplice after all. Well, it'll save me some paperwork just killing you.
AAD00102568	<Draw Weapon> You'll never take me alive, pig!
AAD00102569	Good. Saves me paperwork.
AAD00102570	I had no idea that package had chems! Contreras gave it to me!
AAD00102571	Contreras, huh? We suspected he was involved somehow.
AAD00102572	It looks like you just gave me the evidence I've been looking for.
AAD00102573	Close enough. Yeah, Contreras told me to give Price this package.
AAD00102574	Let's see here...
AAD00102575	Congratulations, you're under arrest for chem trafficking. Hand over your weapons and come with me.
AAD00102576	Um, well... Nevermind.
AAD00102577	Speech Attempt to Gain Entrance
AAD00102578	[FAILED] Who the fuck you trying to kid? You're lucky if I let you walk away from this, asshole.
AAD00102579	Your boss, um... He summoned me here.
AAD00102580	VMS07Greeting
AAD00102581	This is what I've been waiting to see! A big bad Khan bringing in the medicine! How about you toss some Psycho my way?
AAD00102582	I wasn't expecting a resupply so soon, so you have anything from Red Rock Canyon to sell me?
AAD00102583	NCR? Here? Not for long.
AAD00102584	<Give 500 caps> Okay, make that 500 caps. I'm sure Contreras can skim for you.
AAD00102585	I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
AAD00102586	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
AAD00102587	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates. Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
AAD00102588	Otherwise, he'll be reported as a traitor selling contraband to the enemy and go in front of a firing squad.
AAD00102589	He seemed focused on results. Maybe not so much on people.
AAD00102590	[SUCCEEDED] He's not what you'd call... warm. Unless he wants something from you. And even then, it's kind of a cold warm.
AAD00102591	Most of the time, I focus on the science and try to forget him. He doesn't get mixed up in any actual work. Though he tells people that he does.
AAD00102592	Hildern mentioned the Followers of the Apocalypse...
AAD00102593	My father used to say good things about them, but that was years ago... back when they'd teach farmers and ranchers about crop rotation and the like.
AAD00102594	Nowadays... they've changed. They're doing what they can to discredit the NCR, give us a bad name with the locals.
AAD00102595	Dr. Hildern trained with them, years ago. Not me, though. I'm an OSI girl.
AAD00102596	I hear the food around here is pretty bad.
AAD00102597	It's foul, to tell the truth. Most people try to get what they can from the outside... even if it's just a smuggled candy bar, now and then.
AAD00102598	Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free.
AAD00102599	Got anything for sale?
AAD00102600	Take your pick.
AAD00102601	I took care of the Ranger.
AAD00102602	Good to hear.
AAD00102603	I convinced the Ranger to work with you. You're safe, but be careful.
AAD00102604	No problem. Consider it done.
AAD00102605	He's looking to break up trafficking. Maybe there is money to be made here...
AAD00102606	[SUCCEEDED] That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
AAD00102607	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
AAD00102608	[FAILED] No way. I'm making too much money to just hand him the entire contraband operation.
AAD00102609	Killing a Ranger brings big risks. Killing gets expensive.
AAD00102610	[FAILED] You've got brass balls, but no deal. I'm already offering you access to my stash if you take care of this.
AAD00102611	Hey man, you never said anything about killing. Cough up some caps.
AAD00102612	We don't have to kill him. You could work with him and make caps.
AAD00102613	[FAILED] No deals. I want that son of a bitch dead.
AAD00102614	Kill him? Can't we just cut a deal or something?
AAD00102615	[Speech] You must miss giving orders, now that all your men are dead.
AAD00102616	[?] Foot soldiers of the Legion are trained not to have to think for themselves - to have conflict removed from their minds.
AAD00102617	They kill themselves to evade capture because they are not trusted to make such a decision rationally in the heat of battle.
AAD00102618	But I'm no foot soldier. I knew I could escape captivity on my own, without revealing the tiniest iota of information to my captors.
AAD00102619	<Lie> Keely is safe. She's just finishing up some research in the vault.
AAD00102620	[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern.
AAD00102621	But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten.
AAD00102622	Sorry. I shouldn't question your word. If you say Keely's safe, I owe you these caps.
AAD00102623	You've been tricked, Silus. I'm working with the NCR. I just got you to talk.
AAD00102624	No! You slimy bastard!
AAD00102625	No! You cursed bitch!
AAD00102626	I could just tell them you are dead. For a price.
AAD00102627	Well now, I guess that depends on who's paying.
AAD00102628	Appearances can be deceiving. Shall we?
AAD00102629	Cool. I haven't had a good fight in a while, and it's been ages since Donnie and Marie had something they could sink their teeth into!
AAD00102630	The NCR sent me here to take care of you.
AAD00102631	You? Take care of me? Ha! You don't look half-tough enough.
AAD00102632	I have some chems that I can sell.
AAD00102633	Deal is still the same, 20 caps each for Jet, Psycho, or Buffout.
AAD00102634	I'm here to do some business with chems.
AAD00102635	Is there any place to buy weapons and armor?
AAD00102636	I think there're a few places, but I've heard that the Gun Runners sell the best.
AAD00102637	I'm asking nicely. I only do that *once.*
AAD00102638	[FAILED] I ain't moving my stuff just 'cause you asked, nicely or not. Get the fuck out of my sight, punk.
AAD00102639	I'm asking nicely. Maybe you should go before I get angry at you.
AAD00102640	I'll recover your husband's body.
AAD00102641	Ma'am, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
AAD00102642	Esteban's body is laid out between some of the buildings, east of the REPCONN headquarters. At least, that's what his squadmates said.
AAD00102643	There's an NCR position just north of there. It's on the way. They should be able to tell you what the situation is.
AAD00102644	You look upset. What's wrong?
AAD00102645	My husband... he's a Ranger, and he... he got murdered by a pack of Fiends. Goddamn savages laid his body out to rot.
AAD00102646	Brass won't say it to me straight, but they mean to leave Esteban out there. I can see that plain.
AAD00102647	Some other guy replaced Price, and he definitely didn't know the password.
AAD00102648	Ah, shit. I'm guessing he got caught by the NCR. You need to kill that guy now that he's seen you.
AAD00102649	Last thing we need is some investigator tracking you down. Get it done, and I think we can settle accounts, so to speak.
AAD00102650	<Draw Weapon> And now I'm going to kill you, you lying son of a bitch.
AAD00102651	Whoa! Hold on a minute, buddy...
AAD00102652	Whoa! Hold on a minute, honey...
AAD00102653	Son of a... Sir, I didn't know anything about this.
AAD00102654	I'd like to buy some supplies.
AAD00102655	Hey, I heard you were able to recover Morales' corpse. In thanks, you get a discount on supplies.
AAD00102656	That was a real honorable thing you done there, kid. Much appreciated.
AAD00102657	Here's what's currently available.
AAD00102658	What do you do around here?
AAD00102659	I'm a private in the NCR army, and I've been proudly serving for two years now.
AAD00102660	Although, if you were to ask what I'm doing right this instant, I'm patrolling the farms. It's a safe post, but a little boring.
AAD00102661	I do get to take shots at marauding Molerats every once in awhile, and that's always fun.
AAD00102662	Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
AAD00102663	I do get to take shots at Molerats once in a while, so that's always fun.
AAD00102664	Okay, 200 is a deal.
AAD00102665	Alright then, take my helmet and bring it to the NCR. That should be proof enough. This doesn't make us friends though.
AAD00102666	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AAD00102667	I was thinking closer to 150.
AAD00102668	Okay, I don't need the money that bad. 150 it is. This doesn't make us friends though.
AAD00102669	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AAD00102670	The NCR is leaving you alone, 150 seems like a small price to pay.
AAD00102671	You should pay me, I'm providing you the service.
AAD00102672	I'm not going to pay you squat. Now get outta my face.
AAD00102673	Yeah, that sounds like an alright deal. Here take my helmet back to the NCR. This doesn't make us friends though.
AAD00102674	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
AAD00102675	How about you give me 75 caps, it'll keep the hit squads away for a bit.
AAD00102676	Sure, how can I help?
AAD00102677	Time is of the essence, so I'll be brief. This place is filled with spores that are toxic to humans, and we need to get rid of them.
AAD00102678	I've pumped the vault full of a highly flammable gas that, once ignited, should destroy the vast majority of spores. There's one problem, though.
AAD00102679	The gas becomes semi-inert on exposure to oxygen, meaning the gas will have to be ignited close to where it's being introduced.
AAD00102680	I need you to find the vents where the gas is being pumped and ignite it. Oh, and survive the resulting blast.
AAD00102681	<Give 100 caps> 200 seems a bit steep. How about 100?
AAD00102682	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain, but 100 caps will do until we get a regular deal worked out with McCarran.
AAD00102683	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
AAD00102684	<Give 200 caps> Alright. 200 caps it is.
AAD00102685	Great. I'll just pick up future payments from McCarran directly when I drop off my snacks.
AAD00102686	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
AAD00102687	McCarran's mess hall needs more variety. Could we work out a deal?
AAD00102688	Well, business is pretty light and I'd welcome the income, but I'll need a lot of caps to buy the necessary supplies.
AAD00102689	200 caps would get me started.
AAD00102690	Can anything be done to improve your supplies?
AAD00102691	Well, we haven't had any quality meat in months. Everyone in the camp just eating beans for protein... It isn't pretty.
AAD00102692	Some of my kitchen machinery is broken down, too, so we've been eating mostly raw vegetables.
AAD00102693	And I'm desperate for spices or seasonings. Anything. Just something for the general mood around here.
AAD00102694	I'd like to buy some food.
AAD00102695	Chow down.
AAD00102696	Sorry, but the brass ordered me not to serve enemies of NCR.
AAD00102697	I don't like your kind taking food from my men, so I'm going to charge you a little extra. Don't like it? Tough.
AAD00102698	Got anything to eat?
AAD00102699	Oh yeah. You can order up anything you want... as long as it's corn or beans! <Laughs>
AAD00102700	Just kidding. Haven't you heard? With few shipments from home and little variety, the troops are getting restless for some quality grub.
AAD00102701	You can only do so much as a chef with just corn, beans, onions, and peppers.
AAD00102702	Sorry, I don't have time to help you out.
AAD00102703	We're going to die in here. Please, if you find the key let us out. We'll find our own way to safety.
AAD00102704	What are you doing here?
AAD00102705	We were part of a caravan heading into New Vegas from down south. They are holding us hostage, trying to get some ransom.
AAD00102706	Anyone willing to pay for us died in the attack. Once the Fiends figure that out, we are as good as dead.
AAD00102707	Can you set us free now?
AAD00102708	SquatterResult
AAD00102709	That's good to hear. Can't ever be too careful with strangers around here.
AAD00102710	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
AAD00102711	I've dealt with those newcomers.
AAD00102712	McCarran has more vegetables and water than they know what to do with...
AAD00102713	[SUCCEEDED] Fresh food and water is worth its weight in gold... You've got yourself a deal.
AAD00102714	Let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days. I'll pick up the produce at that time as well.
AAD00102715	Maybe we could work something out later.
AAD00102716	Suit yourself. I'm always open to more business.
AAD00102717	On second thought, go ahead and erase the data.
AAD00102718	Glad you're thinking clearly. I was afraid to blink there for a second.
AAD00102719	There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
AAD00102720	Will it take long?
AAD00102721	...it's done. We can rest easy.
AAD00102722	...that's strange. The system says that the files were accessed recently, and copied to an external source.
AAD00102723	You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
AAD00102724	If you're in the neighborhood of Camp McCarran anytime soon, look for Dr. Williams. She was one of the few people I could tolerate.
AAD00102725	She seemed genuinely worried when I agreed to come out here, so if you could be a dear and let her know I'm okay, I'd be most grateful.
AAD00102726	Exactly. Without that knowledge, something similar is bound to occur.
AAD00102727	All right. You convinced me. Take the files back to that buffoon. You make a good point, but I still honestly hope you know what you're doing.
AAD00102728	Who should I be talking to about the intelligence leaks again?
AAD00102729	Well, I'll leave that to you. But I would recommend Lieutenant Boyd and Sergeant Contreras as two people who usually know what's going on around here.
AAD00102730	Understood. I'll go and pick up the explosives.
AAD00102731	Good. Try to plant the explosives quietly if you can - you'll make both our lives easier.
AAD00102732	But first things first. Go offer your services to Colonel Hsu. Tell him you'll work independently to find the leak.
AAD00102733	He's running out of options. He'll accept as long as you don't give him a reason not to.
AAD00102734	If he doesn't, then don't be surprised if you're the new scapegoat. So don't fuck this up.
AAD00102735	Tell me what I need to do.
AAD00102736	I have the explosives stashed in a trash can next to the ticketing counter along with some incriminating documents.
AAD00102737	You'll pick them up and make your way upstairs to the monorail terminal.
AAD00102738	They change the guard there at 0900 and 1800 hours. There'll be a small window where there's no one guarding the train.
AAD00102739	And you have something in mind for me?
AAD00102740	I told you, I think they're starting to suspect me. You're going to help me cast away those suspicions.
AAD00102741	You're going to put the bomb on that train.
AAD00102742	I'll be sure to be in the presence of several reliable eyewitnesses when it happens. Then we're going to pin this on a scapegoat.
AAD00102743	I'd planned on disappearing after this operation. It'd be a matter of time before they traced it to me. Figured out I was a frumentarius.
AAD00102744	But with your help, maybe I can stay on after all. Make plans for something... grander.
AAD00102745	I have a lead. There's been someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
AAD00102746	Is that right? No one has any business being in there after dusk. I wonder...
AAD00102747	There's a lot of communications equipment up there. He could be using it to touch base with whoever sent him.
AAD00102748	You've already done us a lot of good, but I'm afraid to move on this myself. We've tried catching this guy before and he can always smell a trap.
AAD00102749	But he may not know about you. I need you to follow him into the tower. See if you can discover his identity. Report back and I'll have him arrested.
AAD00102750	Report back when you've got it and I'll have him arrested.
AAD00102751	I know who you are. I'm working for the Legion, too.
AAD00102752	Christ, keep it down! You want to blow the whole thing? We've worked years for this.
AAD00102753	But maybe it's good for you here. Hsu knows about the leaks, and I'm supposed to find the spy for him.
AAD00102754	At first I couldn't believe my luck. But since I haven't produced results - for obvious reasons - I feel him looking at me differently now.
AAD00102755	Maybe he's just thinking about putting someone else in charge, maybe he's starting to suspect. Either way it's bad for me.
AAD00102756	Especially once this next part goes down.
AAD00102757	You mentioned your husband works for the caravans?
AAD00102758	Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long hours to provide for our daughter and me.
AAD00102759	You should speak to him if you get the chance - he's always saying how badly understaffed they are.
AAD00102760	What parts are needed to fix the food processor?
AAD00102761	Here's the list. We've been scrapping together quick-fixes to keep it running for months. I think it finally crapped out and needs a full overhaul.
AAD00102762	It's the goofy machine behind the counter in the corner next to the stove. I'd be much obliged if you could take a look at it and get it fixed up.
AAD00102763	Where might I find these parts?
AAD00102764	I don't know. Try the various traders around the wastes, or the pawn shop in Westside might have some parts.
AAD00102765	Oh, I've heard of a place called House Tools you could check out! It's an old factory on the north side of Vegas.
AAD00102766	Just a word of warning, though. I hear no one who goes in there comes back out. Could be traps, crazy robots, or who knows what's in that place.
AAD00102767	Where should I look for spices?
AAD00102768	The Crimson Caravan would probably be able to arrange a regular shipment, but I don't know of any spices known to improve mood.
AAD00102769	Hell, we have a whole research department. One guy's even set up in the main terminal building. They're the ones who oughtta be looking into it.
AAD00102770	I can handle myself pretty well. I found you didn't I?
AAD00102771	You look tough enough at least. I'm not sure how long it'll take this leg to heal up.
AAD00102772	Come on. It's time for us to go take care of Motor-Runner.
AAD00102773	Roger that shit. Let's go.
AAD00102774	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
AAD00102775	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves before they were all killed by the Fiends.
AAD00102776	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
AAD00102777	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AAD00102778	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
AAD00102779	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
AAD00102780	Not right now, just making sure you are okay. I'll be back later.
AAD00102781	Follow me, let's go take care of Motor-Runner.
AAD00102782	Okay, let's get him.
AAD00102783	Got any more open bounties?
AAD00102784	Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
AAD00102785	All right. I'll do it.
AAD00102786	That's the best damn thing I've heard all day. Finally somebody around here with some goddamn ambition.
AAD00102787	There's two psycho-bastards left. Which one will it be?
AAD00102788	I want to claim a bounty.
AAD00102789	That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
AAD00102790	You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
AAD00102791	If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
AAD00102792	Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
AAD00102793	Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
AAD00102794	Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
AAD00102795	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
AAD00102796	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
AAD00102797	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
AAD00102798	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
AAD00102799	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
AAD00102800	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
AAD00102801	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
AAD00102802	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
AAD00102803	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
AAD00102804	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
AAD00102805	Yeah... that's Cook-Cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
AAD00102806	Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
AAD00102807	This is Cook-Cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
AAD00102808	It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
AAD00102809	Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
AAD00102810	Anything else I need to know?
AAD00102811	One more thing. If you want the full reward, you need to bring me a recognizable head. My superiors need proof they're gone.
AAD00102812	That means no headshots. No decapitations 'til after they're dead. And no damage to the face. If you want to be safe, aim for the chest.
AAD00102813	You bring me a head that looks like a rotten tomato, people will be doubting, and I won't be authorized to pay the entire bounty.
AAD00102814	Good luck to you. And don't get careless.
AAD00102815	You've gone after the Fiends before - I don't have to tell you to keep alert. Good luck.
AAD00102816	Just bring me back that last head. And don't lose your own.
AAD00102817	Cook-Cook.
AAD00102818	One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal.
AAD00102819	Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he gets his hands on.
AAD00102820	Only one man's gotten close to killing him, and that's Little Buster. So he says, anyway. Maybe it's bullshit, but I'd still ask him about it.
AAD00102821	Driver Nephi.
AAD00102822	You've got some guts, I'll give you that. Nephi is one tough son of a bitch. You let him get close, and he'll take your head off.
AAD00102823	My advice is this. Talk to Lieutenant Gorobets. He's in charge of Alpha Team, 1st Recon. Snipers.
AAD00102824	If you're lucky, you can lure Nephi into the open, and the sharpshooters can bring him down. You bring me the head, you'll still get the bounty.
AAD00102825	It's a better bet than trying to take Nephi one-on-one, but it's your call.
AAD00102826	Might be. Give me their names.
AAD00102827	First one calls herself Violet. God knows why - the name is the prettiest thing about her. Spends most of her time with a pack of vicious dogs.
AAD00102828	Then there's Driver Nephi. He's fast and he's brutal. Killed about a dozen of my men with a goddamn driver iron. Hence his name.
AAD00102829	And finally... Cook-Cook. Rapist. Pyromaniac. And damn good chef, if you believe the Fiends we've captured. Probably the craziest of the lot.
AAD00102830	I'm not going to feed you any bullshit. These aren't your common Vegas trash. They've all killed good NCR men, and plenty of mercs, too.
AAD00102831	You go after them - any of them - you're in for a hell of a fight. So... which one is it going to be?
AAD00102832	You're having trouble with the Fiends?
AAD00102833	Damn right I am. And I'm paying bounties.
AAD00102834	What do you know about the Fiends?
AAD00102835	Pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every stim, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up earth.
AAD00102836	McCarran could work out a regular exchange of fresh vegetables and clean water.
AAD00102837	[SUCCEEDED] Rations do get tight from time-to-time and it would be nice to keep a regular stock of goods.
AAD00102838	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AAD00102839	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AAD00102840	They have tons of vegetables and water. How about expanding your business?
AAD00102841	[SUCCEEDED] Expanding isn't a bad idea. Maybe I could open up a small cafe restaurant with the more diverse inventory...
AAD00102842	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AAD00102843	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AAD00102844	Corporal Farber said they can pay you the going market price in caps.
AAD00102845	Hey, that sounds good to me. No more wasted meat just laying around to rot. I can keep my stock fresh and keep the caps flowing.
AAD00102846	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
AAD00102847	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
AAD00102848	McCarran is looking for a regular delivery of meat from local merchants.
AAD00102849	Really? Well, I obviously couldn't supply enough to feed the entire camp, but I'm game. What kind of caps are we talking here?
AAD00102850	This spore pod extract from Keely should help with morale.
AAD00102851	No shit? The stuff actually does all that, huh?
AAD00102852	I'll have to start testing this out immediately. This will really help keep the guys focused.
AAD00102853	I fixed the food processor.
AAD00102854	Amazing. I thought that thing was done for. That'll help me transform what I can offer the troops.
AAD00102855	I'll give you a little extra discount the next time you buy food from me. Thanks again.
AAD00102856	I found a merchant named Fitz who agreed to sell meat to McCarran.
AAD00102857	Good, that should help diversify things. It may be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
AAD00102858	Great! What he sells might be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
AAD00102859	Blake at the Crimson Caravan agreed to sell meat and spices.
AAD00102860	Good to hear. That should cover the majority of the supply.
AAD00102861	That should help balance our stock of food more reasonably and save us a ton of caps. Good work!
AAD00102862	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices for vegetables and water.
AAD00102863	You managed to swing us a discount and cover the majority of the meat supply we need? Good work!
AAD00102864	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices at a generous discount.
AAD00102865	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade with McCarran.
AAD00102866	Great! Small price to pay in caps for a little variety in our weekly menu.
AAD00102867	That'll save us some caps and help offload a bit of our overstock.
AAD00102868	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade snacks for vegetables and water.
AAD00102869	I've got proof of what I've said.
AAD00102870	I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before I run you off the hard way.
AAD00102871	Is there any work to be had here?
AAD00102872	You know, hiring isn't really my department. You should talk to Ms. McLafferty about work for hire.
AAD00102873	Like I said, talk to Alice McLafferty, she's in charge here.
AAD00102874	Who did you say I should ask about work?
AAD00102875	Hsu won't trust me enough to let me investigate.
AAD00102876	Yeah, you haven't exactly kept a low profile. That narrows our options somewhat. They're not gonna believe your accusations.
AAD00102877	But you can still create an alibi for me. I could make sure people know I haven't been near the monorail all day while you're busy blowing it up.
AAD00102878	It'll be better with a scapegoat, but it'll at least deflect some suspicion.
AAD00102879	FiendCookCookGrief
AAD00102880	No! Queenie! Hahaha! I'm gonna burn the world for ya, Queenie!
AAD00102881	That sounds good to me. What do you need done?
AAD00102882	What do you know about Driver Nephi and Cook-Cook?
AAD00102883	Don't fuck with Fiends. Driver Nephi'll brain your skull in! Cook-Cook... don't even know what he'll do.
AAD00102884	Who are you?
AAD00102885	Who wants to know? You here for my dogs? Can't have my dogs. Here for meat? You can't have my meat. Meat's for dogs.
AAD00102886	I'm Violet. Dogs are mine. Meat is mine.
AAD00102887	<Draw Weapon> Nevermind. I think killing you will keep things simple.
AAD00102888	Leave him alone and he'll share contact information.
AAD00102889	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
AAD00102890	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
AAD00102891	Contreras would like to work with you.
AAD00102892	Really now? We had our suspicions about that man, but he's got so many shipments going so many different directions it's been hard to track.
AAD00102893	What exactly is his offer? Does he realize bribing a Ranger is a hanging offense?
AAD00102894	Can you remember anything else?
AAD00102895	Seem to recall a lot of them did business with those scavengers over on the West Side - Dermot and Saint James.
AAD00102896	Sounds like a chaotic place. Is there any way I can help?
AAD00102897	Well, I am a little short-staffed. Maybe you could give me a hand.
AAD00102898	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just up and vanished.
AAD00102899	I've also got Keith and his gambling to deal with - I know that skunk's cheating folk out of their savings, I just can't prove it.
AAD00102900	I found this teddy bear in Saint James' room. Look familiar?
AAD00102901	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
AAD00102902	Who are you?
AAD00102903	Captain Parker. I'm in charge of this camp.
AAD00102904	Would you sell me one?
AAD00102905	Sell?! My dogs! What part don't you get? Mine! Lucky they don't eat you alive for that!
AAD00102906	Who's the merchandise?
AAD00102907	Three flavors to choose from - Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy. Sweetie's the house favorite, for reasons that should be obvious.
AAD00102908	Maude is what you might call the discount rack. She's what a customer wears if he doesn't have the caps to afford Sweetie - or just likes them old.
AAD00102909	Jimmy's more of a "specialist." I only hear good things.
AAD00102910	All right, then. Looks like I need to talk slow and use small words. There's Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy.
AAD00102911	I heard about what happened to Corporal Betsy.
AAD00102912	The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit.
AAD00102913	Th-this again?
AAD00102914	You're right. I'm sorry.
AAD00102915	Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
AAD00102916	VFreeformMcCarran2POW2Speech
AAD00102917	Here, maybe you'd better step out for a moment. You've upset him.
AAD00102918	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
AAD00102919	You got his book? Dermot, this bastard got your book! He got your book!
AAD00102920	You got his book? Dermot, this bitch got your book! She got your book!
AAD00102921	Oh. You've got a little pet. How sweet.
AAD00102922	Yes, you are! Yes, that's right!
AAD00102923	Boy... I sure could use some drugs. You know anybody that sells drugs?
AAD00102924	[FAILED] What? Are you some kind of idiot? Why, uh... why would I know that?
AAD00102925	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I getcha. Lookin for a slightly more chemical thrill?
AAD00102926	Okay, I tell you what - I happen to keep some Jet around for emergencies. 35 caps and it's yours.
AAD00102927	Gambling's not my scene. Maybe you could hook me up with something "medicinal?"
AAD00102928	From what I hear, your players are pretty unlucky. What's your secret?
AAD00102929	[FAILED] I guess Lady Luck just smiles on me, that's all. Nothing special about it.
AAD00102930	[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Well, let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
AAD00102931	I've run some cons in my day - one clever bastard to another, what's your trick?
AAD00102932	Sure, I'm in. Why not?
AAD00102933	Glad to have you. Let's go. Just stick close and follow my lead. Keith's a cowardly son of a bitch, but he might try something if he's desperate.
AAD00102934	Tell me about Keith again.
AAD00102935	Marked cards, huh? I suppose it's obvious, really. Here, you've earned this.
AAD00102936	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind back-up.
AAD00102937	I've got evidence - Keith has a set of marked cards he uses to cheat.
AAD00102938	Son of a bitch - I knew he was involved with drugs. Thanks - this gives me the evidence I need. Here - you've earned this.
AAD00102939	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind back-up.
AAD00102940	I've got evidence - Keith is selling drugs to the locals.
AAD00102941	Drugs and crooked gambling? Can't say I'm surprised. Here, you've earned this.
AAD00102942	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind back-up.
AAD00102943	I've got proof that Keith is selling drugs and using marked cards.
AAD00102944	Tell me about this "Keith."
AAD00102945	Keith's a two-bit hustler, he runs a gambling operation out of his shack. Ask me, he wins way too often to be playing fair.
AAD00102946	I suspect he's running drugs, too, I just can't prove it. Maybe you can find something - talk to him, poke around his shack, something.
AAD00102947	First I've heard about conscience in a while.
AAD00102948	Yeah, doesn't sound like me at all, right? But it happens.
AAD00102949	Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked-up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
AAD00102950	Might just be sex, though. I see some cute little number, and I'd rather get in her pants. So maybe I'm a stone-cold bitch, after all.
AAD00102951	So snipers work in pairs?
AAD00102952	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
AAD00102953	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. Now if they paired me up with somebody who looks like you...
AAD00102954	Lot of downtime in the army. Nobody around but you and your partner. Plenty of time for... whatever we want.
AAD00102955	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
AAD00102956	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. I keep hoping they'll pair me up with some hot blonde, like you see on those old pinups.
AAD00102957	Shit, I don't even care if she can shoot straight. Can't have everything.
AAD00102958	I thought you should know. Cook-Cook is dead.
AAD00102959	You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy.
AAD00102960	Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would.
AAD00102961	Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment.
AAD00102962	I heard you were raped by Cook-Cook.
AAD00102963	Motor-Runner is dead. I brought his helmet as proof.
AAD00102964	Unbelievable. That man has given us so much grief since we set up here. This may be a major turning point for us.
AAD00102965	I can't tell you how many times we thought we'd taken him out, only to have him show up again later, taking more heads off of fallen troopers.
AAD00102966	This is for the bounty. And this is from a pool me and a lot of the soldiers around the base had going. You may not be NCR, but hey, it's only fair.
AAD00102967	What's going on in Westside?
AAD00102968	I try to keep my people out of Westside. Apart from trying to stay on good terms with the Khans, who do business there... there's Mean Sonofabitch.
AAD00102969	That fucking mutant is more trouble to kill than to avoid. Having someplace for my people to sleep reduces the chances of drifting into Westside.
AAD00102970	FiendWhatLooking2
AAD00102971	Well, keep moving.
AAD00102972	Why did you move the Fiends into this Vault?
AAD00102973	We needed some place to put down roots. I was having trouble keeping my people out of Westside.
AAD00102974	How long have you been stationed here?
AAD00102975	Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
AAD00102976	'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
AAD00102977	Whole thing smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps he's stirring up the locals against us.
AAD00102978	Thanks for the information.
AAD00102979	No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up.
AAD00102980	That light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
AAD00102981	Have you seen anything suspicious around here?
AAD00102982	As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
AAD00102983	Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
AAD00102984	Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
AAD00102985	And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
AAD00102986	Why did you leave the Rangers?
AAD00102987	Well... that wasn't really a matter of choice. Got myself caught by Legionaries, up near Malpais.
AAD00102988	They had themselves some fun with me... mangled my hands and feet pretty good.
AAD00102989	Wasn't much good with a pistol after that. Wasn't gonna be trekking across the waste on any more long scouts, either.
AAD00102990	Goodbye.
AAD00102991	Always a pleasure. Keep yourself safe.
AAD00102992	It's true. I've got a memorable face.
AAD00102993	You're a fine-looking woman, no doubt about that. But I'm looking a little deeper than skin, if you take my meaning.
AAD00102994	Can you heal me?
AAD00102995	I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
AAD00102996	I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
AAD00102997	Wait a minute - why didn't they take you, too?
AAD00102998	I... God help me, I ran! I abandoned my family to those butchers. Not a day goes by I don't hate myself for that.
AAD00102999	I'm so sorry. Can I help?
AAD00103000	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you, my friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower, as if this city is more important.
AAD00103001	From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
AAD00103002	See you later.
AAD00103003	Get it done.
AAD00103004	The guy claiming to stand in for Price is dead.
AAD00103005	Good to hear.
AAD00103006	Well, I'd say you're officially invited to the big kids' table now. My stash is your stash.
AAD00103007	Oh, and I think you might get more use out of this rifle than I ever will. Enjoy.
AAD00103008	I convinced the Ranger to work with you. You're safe, but be careful.
AAD00103009	Price wasn't there. I fought some guy claiming to be his replacement.
AAD00103010	Well, it sounds like you screwed the pooch. Give me the package back.
AAD00103011	Price works alone. If someone has replaced him, it's either some scumbag trying to hijack goods from his suppliers, or worse...
AAD00103012	It could be someone more dangerous. You need to kill him, whoever he is.
AAD00103013	Some guy is standing in for Price. I didn't inquire further.
AAD00103014	Huh. Not good. Price works alone. Chat him up and see what's going on.
AAD00103015	Don't give him any details and do not give him the package. There's a chance he actually knows Price, but I doubt it.
AAD00103016	What were you doing down in that cave?
AAD00103017	The mantises and spore plants virtually ignored me for most of the time I've been here.
AAD00103018	It was only once I began to investigate the fifth level that my presence began to agitate them. I guess I was a little too close to home for them.
AAD00103019	A few days ago, I was attacked by a large number of mantises and was knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I was in that cave.
AAD00103020	The mantises seem to feed some of their prey to the plants. Fortunately for me, it appears the plants are disinclined to eat ghoul meat.
AAD00103021	How did you get this whole gas thing set up so quickly?
AAD00103022	That's a very good question! Actually, I didn't come up with it. The systems were already set up to pump the gas when I first arrived here.
AAD00103023	I believe the scientists were in the process of attempting to ignite the gas just as we're about to do. And by we, I mean you, of course.
AAD00103024	Where did these plants come from?
AAD00103025	From what I've been able to determine, the scientists here managed to breed them by combining traits from two distinct plant species.
AAD00103026	The resulting hybrid proved to be more adaptable than expected, however, and soon became a threat to humans.
AAD00103027	It's sad, really. All those wonderful minds, undone by their own irresponsibility.
AAD00103028	Did you say there'd be a blast?
AAD00103029	Oh yes, I imagine there'll be quite an explosion when the gas gets set off. Fire will probably expand throughout the entire level in mere moments.
AAD00103030	[Attack] The bad news is I'm here to relieve you of your life.
AAD00103031	What- What are you doing?
AAD00103032	[Attack] I'm going to get you in trouble for blowing up the monorail.
AAD00103033	What? Like hell you are.
AAD00103034	<Pull Pin> I just pulled the pin out of somebody's grenade.
AAD00103035	Man, I can't wait to see the look on his face!
AAD00103036	Where is Private Crenshaw's footlocker?
AAD00103037	It's in the main concourse. That's the building just across the skybridge. There's a barracks area that'll be behind you on the left when you enter.
AAD00103038	His stuff will be at the foot of one of the beds.
AAD00103039	Where can I find Private Crenshaw again?
AAD00103040	He's stationed just inside the south wall of the base. Should be on patrol, if he isn't screwing around.
AAD00103041	You're not telling me something. You couldn't have forgotten the whole massacre.
AAD00103042	It's like I tell Major Dhatri. Best not to look under a rock, if you don't really want to know what's there.
AAD00103043	Could be that NCR found some blood on me, and none of it mine. Could be that a few of those Khans didn't die from NCR bullets.
AAD00103044	I had scores of my own to settle... deeper ones than NCR ever had. Don't bother asking who they were with.
AAD00103045	So your name... it comes from Bitter Springs.
AAD00103046	You're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
AAD00103047	After that - if you haven't begged for mercy - you get to choose a new name. One you'll use for the rest of your life.
AAD00103048	When NCR slaughtered the Khans at Bitter Springs, I hadn't got my beat-down yet. I was still too young.
AAD00103049	Way I see it, Bitter Springs was my beat-down. So afterward... I gave myself a name. It's all I've got from the Khans, and it's all I ever want.
AAD00103050	Tell me about what happened to them at Bitter Springs.
AAD00103051	It was a massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
AAD00103052	But I was there. Saw it myself. I don't care what anybody says. The Khans asked for Bitter Springs. They wouldn't leave the NCR be.
AAD00103053	My damn parents, too. They were just as bad as the rest.
AAD00103054	I didn't mean to offend. You don't have to tell me, if you'd rather not.
AAD00103055	[SUCCEEDED] It's a Khan name. You know... the "Great Khans." That's what my parents were.
AAD00103056	I figured I grew up around the bastards... they owed me a name, after all they put me through.
AAD00103057	Your father is your commanding officer? Is that allowed?
AAD00103058	Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
AAD00103059	It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
AAD00103060	Not too friendly, are you?
AAD00103061	You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
AAD00103062	Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
AAD00103063	The law is the law. I'm done doing business with you.
AAD00103064	Now see, that's just downright unfriendly of you. I just can't let you go shooting your mouth off to Boyd now can I?
AAD00103065	Lying bastard. I want cut in on this action.
AAD00103066	Bullshit. If you're moving drugs, I'm going to have to report you.
AAD00103067	All right. I guess I believe you.
AAD00103068	VMS08CurtisAmbush
AAD00103069	You're getting too close, shamus!
AAD00103070	This is where your trail runs cold.
AAD00103071	How long have you been a bounty hunter?
AAD00103072	Oh, shit, I don't know. Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
AAD00103073	Why does Dhatri owe you caps?
AAD00103074	Because I killed a couple of marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
AAD00103075	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
AAD00103076	I'll take a look, just to see what sort of shit they were into.
AAD00103077	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
AAD00103078	I've seen enough. You did everyone a service. Take these. Might help if you get in a jam.
AAD00103079	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
AAD00103080	I got a little turned around. Where can I find your boss?
AAD00103081	Can you make it worth my while?
AAD00103082	I don't know. Carter told me about some password he hacked out of a computer. I could give it to you, if you help us out.
AAD00103083	Give me the password he found, and I'll help you escape.
AAD00103084	[FAILED] Help us first, then we'll give you the password, and don't think about killing me. It's all in my head.
AAD00103085	If I help you escape, will you give me the password he found?
AAD00103086	Yeah, it's yours if you help us out of here.
AAD00103087	A gang called the Scorpions murdered him. A man named Anderson witnessed it.
AAD00103088	Shit. That's why you don't go wandering off looking for some call girl on the Strip without telling somebody first.
AAD00103089	Anderson. Is that the Followers of the Apocalypse Anderson?
AAD00103090	He was killed by a man named Anderson he caught stealing water from the NCR.
AAD00103091	Anderson. I've heard of him, if it's the same guy. Water nerd from the Followers of the Apocalypse. Used to handle some of the operations for OSI.
AAD00103092	I don't know what to think about the Followers. The things they do... hard to say if they're helping or hurting sometimes. Especially in Freeside.
AAD00103093	I'll have to send some people out there to make sure we don't lose any more water. That stuff's like gold out here.
AAD00103094	But you. I owe you for this. You saved me a lot of work. And I'm sure Corporal White's family will be grateful to at least get some closure.
AAD00103095	The MPs keep a bunch of junk around that's confiscated off of people who decide to screw with us.
AAD00103096	I haven't really sorted through it, but go ahead and see if there's anything you can use in there.
AAD00103097	We keep it in a trunk across the hall, by the prison cells.
AAD00103098	Isaac has me out looking for metal so they can do the first shipment.
AAD00103099	Well what the hell are you doing here? Get your ass out and find that metal. Don't come back until the job is done!
AAD00103100	<Draw Weapon> You're a dead man.
AAD00103101	Whoa! Hold on a minute, buddy...
AAD00103102	Whoa! Hold on a minute, lady...
AAD00103103	Has your research here turned up anything interesting?
AAD00103104	A few things here and there, but a lot of the data has been corrupted, and all of the live samples have been contaminated by the spore plants.
AAD00103105	One interesting thing I found is that one of the chemicals secreted by the spore plants serves as a mild stimulant when ingested by humans.
AAD00103106	As far as I can tell, it has no side effects or addictive properties, aside from the inherent psychological ones, of course.
AAD00103107	Now that I think of it, there was a Cpl. Farber back at McCarran who'd probably be interested in it. There's a sample of it around here somewhere.
AAD00103108	Nice to meet you.
AAD00103109	A pleasure to meet you, madam. What may I do for you?
AAD00103110	Nothing today. Goodbye.
AAD00103111	I'm here to buy out Cassidy Caravans for the Crimson Caravan Company.
AAD00103112	Okay! Sold!
AAD00103113	Goodbye.
AAD00103114	Bye.
AAD00103115	Actually, I'm supposed to be getting a body out of there.
AAD00103116	Tell me again what I need to do.
AAD00103117	I wish you'd paid attention the first time! All you need to do is attach the deployable ballast to the plane.
AAD00103118	Some of my robots will carry a remote activation station out to the shore. Attach the ballast, hit a button, and they'll handle the rest.
AAD00103119	Where is the bomber located?
AAD00103120	I told you, at the bottom of Lake Mead! I'll make sure the location is displayed on your Pip-Boy map.
AAD00103121	Where is the bomber located?
AAD00103122	It's at the bottom of Lake Mead. I'll mark its location on your Pip-Boy map.
AAD00103123	Just take all of it.
AAD00103124	Hey, thanks!
AAD00103125	He's doing well. I'll come back when I have some more information.
AAD00103126	Okay, talk to you soon.
AAD00103127	I'm not sure. Let me think about it and I'll come back to you.
AAD00103128	Okay, let me know when you have an idea.
AAD00103129	<Lie> You have permission. They know you're coming.
AAD00103130	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Thank you so much! I'll get going right away.
AAD00103131	He's a special sort of guy - perfect for a special sort of gal.
AAD00103132	Ooh, I've just got to meet him! Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
AAD00103133	He's nice, maybe a little naive. Seems convinced you're the love of his life.
AAD00103134	Really? That's so sweet!
AAD00103135	I'd love to go meet him. Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
AAD00103136	VCG00OpeningSequence
AAD00103137	Oh, I almost forgot. Take off the hood.
AAD00103138	How else are we supposed to get back, genius?
AAD00103139	East? You moron! That'll take us days out of our way.
AAD00103140	
AAD00103141	I'm glad you made it out here. You're even more stunning up close than you were at a distance.
AAD00103142	Sounds like you're a little disappointed in your troops.
AAD00103143	Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no esprit de corps.
AAD00103144	The squad leader's got some promise, kid named Mags, but as for the rest... I don't see much hope.
AAD00103145	I'm going to make them shape up if it kills me, though. Or them, for that matter.
AAD00103146	Sgt. McCredie asked me to talk to you about getting your squad in shape.
AAD00103147	He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
AAD00103148	Hoo-hoo! Hot damn, it's gonna be a party in the camp tonight!
AAD00103149	I got you the stuff.
AAD00103150	Yo, I'll tell you what this squad needs. A healthy dose of angry juice.
AAD00103151	That seems highly illogical. What reason would he have for doing that?
AAD00103152	To me? Well, I'll tell you what I think this squad needs: a little more basic human niceness.
AAD00103153	It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
AAD00103154	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
AAD00103155	Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
AAD00103156	So, about those improvements....
AAD00103157	Like I said, you get the juice, we'll cut loose.
AAD00103158	About getting the squad's readiness reports up....
AAD00103159	And what do you propose?
AAD00103160	Going back to those squad improvements, I had an idea.
AAD00103161	You did? Does that mean you're going to help?
AAD00103162	I thought about what you said about basic human niceness.
AAD00103163	Can you tell me anything about Camp Golf?
AAD00103164	What do you want to know? Whole place used to be some kinda rich bastard resort, back before the war.
AAD00103165	Now the Rangers use the old resort, and we grunts get to live in tents. Fucking typical.
AAD00103166	What's a Master-At-Arms?
AAD00103167	I oversee the security of the Nellis homeland, from the coordination of its defense to the training and fitness of its population.
AAD00103168	All right. Lead the way.
AAD00103169	Follow close - and mind your behavior.
AAD00103170	I hear you've got dynamite. It would help us beat the Powder Gangers.
AAD00103171	What are you going to do?
AAD00103172	Some of the others, like Sunny, will probably stand up for Ringo if he asks for help, which he hasn't.
AAD00103173	Personally, I hope he sneaks out of town one night and takes the Powder Gangers with him.
AAD00103174	Where is Ringo now?
AAD00103175	He's holed up at the abandoned gas station up the hill.
AAD00103176	I overheard your argument. What was that all about?
AAD00103177	Looks like our little town got itself dragged into the middle of something we don't want anything to do with.
AAD00103178	About a week ago, this trader, Ringo, comes into town. Survivor of an attack, he says. Bad men after him, needs a place to hide.
AAD00103179	We figured he was just in shock, so we gave him a place to lie low. We didn't actually expect anyone to come after him.
AAD00103180	Why are the Powder Gangers out to get you?
AAD00103181	My caravan was on the return trip from California and heading back to the company branch in New Vegas when we got jumped.
AAD00103182	Not even a "drop your weapons and hands up" before the bullets started flying. We put up a good fight, but there was too many of them.
AAD00103183	I took a few of the bandits down before I ran, so I figure their friends are out for revenge.
AAD00103184	What do you know about the situation with the Powder Gangers?
AAD00103185	If Ringo doesn't head out on his own, I think we should hand him over. The town shouldn't get itself mixed into the problem.
AAD00103186	Don't mistake that for coward talk, though. We're a town of survivors. We'll fight tooth and nail if pushed, but we don't go looking for trouble.
AAD00103187	I'm going to help Ringo take on the Powder Gangers. I might need your help.
AAD00103188	It's odd that Cobb wasn't able to find Ringo. The town's not that big.
AAD00103189	Cobb hasn't exactly been looking for Ringo too hard - I think he's afraid that Ringo will ambush him, which is probably true.
AAD00103190	How many Powder Gangers are out there?
AAD00103191	I need medical treatment.
AAD00103192	Seeing as you're a friend of ours, I suppose we could trade for what you need.
AAD00103193	I'm afraid medications are in short supply. Maybe you should seek medical treatment away from Nellis.
AAD00103194	<Lie> Yep, power on, ants dead, all good.
AAD00103195	Mother Pearl said you have a "bug problem?"
AAD00103196	Long story short, the power failed a few days ago because giant ants have tunneled into the generator room and set up a nest.
AAD00103197	I led a team down to exterminate them, but there were... so many of them. We lost: Two killed, three wounded.
AAD00103198	Personally, I think it's more than a savage can handle, but if you want to kill those ants and switch the power back on, feel free.
AAD00103199	<SPEECH TEST: Player presses for details>
AAD00103200	[SUCCEEDED] You have to keep in mind that you're our first contact with the outside world since I was barely a woman.
AAD00103201	Seclusion has kept us safe, but the world around us is changing. Neon lights in the distance, patrolling robots, soldiers...
AAD00103202	My youngers think our guns can keep out the world, but I think we need to let it in, just a little, or become its victim.
AAD00103203	You're that little bit of the world, child. Welcome to Nellis.
AAD00103204	How can we trust each other if you're going to be keeping secrets?
AAD00103205	<Lie> I'm sorry Lindsay. Mister Cuddles is dead.
AAD00103206	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles!
AAD00103207	Okay, I'll look for him.
AAD00103208	Any ideas how to get to the bottom of Lake Mead without drowning?
AAD00103209	Might try holding your breath. If that doesn't sound good enough, talk to Jack. He was working on a rebreather once.
AAD00103210	That sounds really creepy, Loyal.
AAD00103211	Ain't nothing creepy about it. It's a term of respect!
AAD00103212	<Lie> She was so excited to see you, she wouldn't wait.
AAD00103213	[FAILED] Then why didn't you stop her? You could've tackled her or something! You knew how much she meant to me!
AAD00103214	Just - just go away!
AAD00103215	<Lie> It's a tragedy. She loved you so much, she risked it all.
AAD00103216	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my sweet blameless Red! Curse the walls of Nellis! Curse our guns and isolation! Her blood is on our hands!
AAD00103217	Only if we stop shelling everyone who comes close will some good come from this tragedy. If you'll excuse me...
AAD00103218	I told her how to get through the artillery barrage.
AAD00103219	Wow, that seems dangerous, but if you really think it's safe, I'll trust you. You did make it here, after all.
AAD00103220	I've seen her, but we haven't talked about you yet.
AAD00103221	What are you waiting for? I've been losing sleep... wonder what she'll say!
AAD00103222	Does Goodsprings get many visitors?
AAD00103223	Mostly traders looking to buy Bighorner meat and hides. The traders are the main reason the general store manages to stay in business.
AAD00103224	Most travelers heading south on the I-15 just push on towards Primm unless they're in desperate need of supplies.
AAD00103225	What other towns are nearby?
AAD00103226	Southeast of here is Primm - can't miss it, since it has the giant old rollercoaster right in the middle of town. The NCR's got an outpost there.
AAD00103227	If you follow the road north, you'll eventually hit Sloan and Quarry Junction. They mine rocks or something, but I heard they got troubles lately.
AAD00103228	I wouldn't head that direction if I were you, though. Got critters up there that don't take kindly to getting shot.
AAD00103229	Let's talk about the areas around Goodsprings.
AAD00103230	Sure. What do you want to know?
AAD00103231	SSHQFestusLOS2
AAD00103232	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-Cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
AAD00103233	SSHQFestusLOS1
AAD00103234	Looooong ago, people didn't really have many choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-Cola.
AAD00103235	SSHQFestusDepositStars
AAD00103236	Wahoo, you did it pardner! Bully for you! Ol' Festus knew you could do it. I suppose you'll be wanting that prize now.
AAD00103237	Well then, hold onto your hat, because it's a doozy. Not many people have heard the true story behind Sunset Sarsaparilla. It's a right honor.
AAD00103238	And now, without further ado, your prize - The Legend of the Star...
AAD00103239	Looooong ago, people didn't have a heap of choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-Cola.
AAD00103240	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-Cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
AAD00103241	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, and asked his patrons what flavor they'd like it to be.
AAD00103242	After getting no help from them, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested the man make a sarsaparilla flavored drink.
AAD00103243	The stranger said he would happily share his family's recipe for the drink, on one condition.
AAD00103244	The condition being that the stranger would be allowed to sample a bottle whenever he liked, to ensure the recipe was being followed to the letter.
AAD00103245	The man happily agreed, thinking the drink would make him rich, and the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day.
AAD00103246	The next morning, the sheriff stopped by and reported that the stranger's body was found on the side of the town road. He'd been killed by bandits.
AAD00103247	The man, cursing his luck, closed the saloon early that day, just as the sun began to set.
AAD00103248	But after he had locked the doors, he turned around to find an unfamiliar bottle on the bar, with a note beneath it.
AAD00103249	The note was sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, the man found it contained a recipe for a sarsaparilla-flavored drink.
AAD00103250	Sampling the bottle's contents and finding it singularly delicious, the man gave silent thanks to his mysterious benefactor, wherever he was.
AAD00103251	Being an honorable man, the saloon owner paid for the stranger's funeral, thinking it was the least he could do to repay him.
AAD00103252	The saloon owner went on to become rich selling the new drink, and to this day some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a blue star under their caps.
AAD00103253	Some say the saloon owner ordered it done, in honor of the stranger. Others say it's the stranger, sampling the bottles like he promised.
AAD00103254	And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
AAD00103255	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
AAD00103256	SSHQFestusLHInstructions
AAD00103257	Lucky Horseshoes is played with cards numbered two through ten and aces, which have a value of one.
AAD00103258	You and ol' Festus will take turns drawing cards. Each time we draw a card, we add it to our total, trying to hit the magic number of twenty one.
AAD00103259	If either of us draws a card that brings our total up to the same number as the other, it pushes the other player's total up one.
AAD00103260	When this happens, it's called Lucky Horseshoes! Ol' Festus thought of the name himself, I'll have you know.
AAD00103261	When one of us is closer to twenty one and the other can't get any closer, either by going over or because he or she held, the closer player wins.
AAD00103262	Ol' Festus likes the game because there are no ties in Lucky Horseshoes. If someone's sitting pretty on twenty one, Lady Luck can still bump 'em off!
AAD00103263	But enough jawing. By now you're as eager as I am to get tossing.
AAD00103264	How do I play?
AAD00103265	Let's go.
AAD00103266	Oh, Easy Pete came through with the dynamite. Here's your supply. I really hope I don't blow myself up.
AAD00103267	I'll be set up near the store. Let's hope that the gang doesn't manage to make it that far.
AAD00103268	I'm just passing through.
AAD00103269	I'm just passing through.
AAD00103270	I'm just passing through.
AAD00103271	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Does La Fantoma need some power gum?
AAD00103272	[Offer Chems] You know what will help you box better? Psycho. Would you like some?
AAD00103273	[Offer Radioactive Gum] I hear dinosaurs like gum.
AAD00103274	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Here you go kid, gum is fun!
AAD00103275	[Offer Toy Rocket] I believe La Fantoma could use a rocket toy to enhance her flight.
AAD00103276	[Offer Toy Rocket] Mission control, you can't fly without a rocket. Here, take this toy rocket.
AAD00103277	[Offer Toy Dinosaur] Woah there, Red-Brick, why don't you box with this dinosaur toy?
AAD00103278	[Offer Toy Rocket] I found this rocket toy you can have.
AAD00103279	A rocket! Yay! Vrooom!
AAD00103280	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Hey kid, I have some gum here. It is good for you!
AAD00103281	What say I help you take over this town?
AAD00103282	What the hell for? Just farmers and ranchers out here. Not much worth stealing.
AAD00103283	Didn't you already ask me about this? What the hell for - this place is worthless.
AAD00103284	Exhale before you fire. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it.
AAD00103285	[FAILED] I'm really not sure how this works.
AAD00103286	You're never going to hit anything shooting in one direction. Fire wildly!

AAD00103312	And here I thought we had them running as best we could before they broke down again. Thanks for getting those sorted for me.
AAD00103313	I fixed the arrays and improved their efficiency a bit too.
AAD00103314	VFreeformGoodSpringsDocMitchellSpeechCheck
AAD00103315	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
AAD00103316	Isn't it customary for a doctor to prescribe follow-up medication?
AAD00103317	VCG01DocMitchellTellMeAboutYou
AAD00103318	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, I was a traveling doctor for a spell.
AAD00103319	Seemed like a good idea at the time. Most folks out here ain't educated, so people with medical know-how are hard to come by.
AAD00103320	Found that I could help a lot of people with what I knew, and that was all right with me.
AAD00103321	Eventually, I went back and married my childhood sweetheart and that was the end of my traveling days. Didn't miss it none then. Still don't.
AAD00103322	Tell me about yourself, Doc.
AAD00103323	VCG01DocMitchellWhoRescued
AAD00103324	That'd be Victor. Curious fella. He's sort of odd. And I don't just mean 'cause he's a robot. I couldn't tell you much about him.
AAD00103325	He's real friendly, don't get me wrong. You just get the sense that ain't the whole picture. Just a feeling.
AAD00103326	Keeps to himself, mostly. You want to know more about him, you'll have to ask him yourself. He has a shack on the southern edge of town.
AAD00103327	Who was it that rescued me?
AAD00103328	Yeah, you've been a real bundle of laughs.
AAD00103329	Yeah, right. Bitch.
AAD00103330	Yeah, right. Dick.
AAD00103331	I guess you could start the engines underwater and hop it up onto shore...
AAD00103332	[FAILED] I'm not a mechanic, but after 300 years I don't think those engines would start up.
AAD00103333	But a little radiation didn't keep your people away!
AAD00103334	That's right! Our Geiger counter indicates that the base was radioactive, but not dangerously so. Enough time has passed.
AAD00103335	Sure, I can spare the time.
AAD00103336	Excellent. Imagine - you're the first outsider to ever hear our tale! <clears throat>
AAD00103337	<Lie> Make it 700 caps or I'll tell the Boomers to adjust their trajectory.
AAD00103338	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain. Here you go. Have a nice day.
AAD00103339	<Speech>
AAD00103340	[FAILED] Who I am and what I am doing is my business. Now are you in the market for info or not?
AAD00103341	Who the hell are you?
AAD00103342	<Science skill>
AAD00103343	[FAILED] Sorry, there is no way it would withstand submersion. It has to be watertight, and the past few times I've tested it I've gotten a mouthful of water.
AAD00103344	A pressure cooker would have the gaskets and valving I need to seal it up.
AAD00103345	Aw c'mon, it looks fine. I bet the seal will hold.
AAD00103346	I need to get to Primm. Can you suggest a route?
AAD00103347	Sure can. Take the road southeast out of town till it hits the freeway. Primm is the town with the roller coaster, straight south. Can't miss it.
AAD00103348	NCR patrols do a good job of keeping the highway clear, but I'd keep your gun where you can reach it easily. You never know who you'll run into.
AAD00103349	Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife. My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.
AAD00103350	I fixed your radio.
AAD00103351	Yeah, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
AAD00103352	A man named Joe Cobb was looking for you, but I killed him.
AAD00103353	Err, thanks, I guess. Cobb wasn't the problem, though - I could've handled him if he ever found me.
AAD00103354	Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I can fight them all.
AAD00103355	What does he actually do around here?
AAD00103356	Other than rolling around once in a while, it doesn't do anything useful as far as I can tell.
AAD00103357	I don't know why it took an interest in you, but I'd be careful. It's never helped anyone before.
AAD00103358	Doc Mitchell said you could teach me to survive in the desert.
AAD00103359	Yeah, I guess there's a thing or two I could show you. Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.
AAD00103360	Meet me outside, behind the saloon.
AAD00103361	SSHQLHFestusDraw
AAD00103362	Looks like I got an eight, pardner.
AAD00103363	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
AAD00103364	<Press the blue button to draw a card.>
AAD00103365	Looks like you got an eight, pardner.
AAD00103366	<Press the blue Draw button.>
AAD00103367	Who is Mother Pearl?
AAD00103368	As I said, she is our Eldest. Mother Pearl has lived at Nellis from the start, and has the wisdom of her age.
AAD00103369	She said that this day would come, and that any savage to reach our gates should be brought to her.
AAD00103370	VFreeformGoodspringsDocMitchellShootoutBags
AAD00103371	I ain't got much, but it'll do you more good out there than it will in here. Take what I got.
AAD00103372	They'll be using explosives. Do you have something for more serious injuries?
AAD00103373	Here are three Stimpaks.
AAD00103374	This'll make you feel better.
AAD00103375	Powder Gangers?
AAD00103376	Who was that man you were arguing with?
AAD00103377	He's a convict. Just without the chains. Said his name was Cobb. "Powder Gangers" is what they call themselves. Plenty more like him out there.
AAD00103378	The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
AAD00103379	Then we are out of here. Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AAD00103380	FSRotfaceSoliciting
AAD00103381	Ha ha ha, oh, that's rich. You're not exactly my type, no offense. No, I meant I could give you a tip. Earn my money, so to speak.
AAD00103382	Are you soliciting me?
AAD00103383	Sure, here you go.
AAD00103384	The first thing you should know is that Freeside is run by a pack of yahoos that call themselves the Kings.
AAD00103385	Their leader, who oddly enough calls himself the King, currently has his hands full trying to prevent an all-out riot in Freeside.
AAD00103386	That's two tips, but what the hell. You're a new customer so the extra one's on me. Wanna hear another?
AAD00103387	At the northwest end of Fremont Street you'll find the Silver Rush. It's run by a rather scary family called the Van Graffs.
AAD00103388	These are not people you want to mess with. But if lasers and such are your thing, the goods they sell are second to none.
AAD00103389	If you've been around the Kings, you may have met one of them named Pacer. He's always stomping around trying to show off his authority.
AAD00103390	Being new, you weren't around when it happened, but a few months ago Pacer pissed off the Van Graff family big time.
AAD00103391	No one knows what went down, but word is the Van Graffs still want him dead.
AAD00103392	The Chairmen run a casino on the Strip called the Tops. It's a pretty classy place, by all reports.
AAD00103393	I haven't been there myself, but I hear security there is kinda tight.
AAD00103394	Traders have been griping for a while now about I-15 being too dangerous to travel. I'd steer clear of it unless you're armed to the teeth.
AAD00103395	What do you need?
AAD00103396	Med-X, RadAway, and Fixer are Freeside essentials. I can't pay you for any supplies you bring in, but I could discount the charge for our services.
AAD00103397	What goods and services do you have to offer?
AAD00103398	We've got liquor, chems, and whores aplenty. Pick your fix and we'll oblige. Our only rule is no sampling the merchandise. Caps paid in advance.
AAD00103399	If you'd like to do a bit of gambling, we have an exchange at the back of the casino on the left.
AAD00103400	Anything going on around here?
AAD00103401	Just the usual. Legion scouts try to slip across the river a couple of times a week, but they always end up floating downriver with holes in their heads.
AAD00103402	Heck Gunderson said he was here to talk business with you. What business?
AAD00103403	What else? Mr. Gunderson and I have been discussing his livestock.
AAD00103404	It's put us in a rather delicate position, you see, his coming here. Not that we aren't grateful for his generous offer.
AAD00103405	But our executive chef Philippe has transformed brahmin steak into a delicacy. He really is a genius. Everyone wants it.
AAD00103406	But a delicacy is just that - delicate. If everyone can get it, it ceases to be a delicacy. It becomes a perfectly ordinary staple.
AAD00103407	And if the Gourmand served staples, it would no longer draw the caliber of people it deserves. It would be a diner or... a family restaurant.
AAD00103408	So as much as we'd all love for there to be enough steak for everyone, I'm afraid there are more important things to consider.
AAD00103409	It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
AAD00103410	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
AAD00103411	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
AAD00103412	I'm looking for someone who went missing here recently.
AAD00103413	This again? I thought this was all settled. I answered every one of that investigator's questions to his satisfaction and gave all the help I could.
AAD00103414	I know our reputation hasn't always been spotless, but that's all in the past now. How some people can't get over it is beyond me.
AAD00103415	For the last time, the White Glove Society has never and will never consume human flesh for any reason. It's written in the charter.
AAD00103416	So you're a rancher?
AAD00103417	Yep, got a whole mess of brahmins to my name. Bighorners, too.
AAD00103418	Used to just have the one ranch, but land was easy to grab before the soldiers moved in.
AAD00103419	Before I knew it I was running one of the biggest ranching operations east of California.
AAD00103420	Now everywhere I go, folks I never even met shake my hand and call me "Mr. Gunderson." Don't quite know what to make of that.
AAD00103421	You lost your son?
AAD00103422	My boy, Ted. He was right here. I didn't leave him but a minute. I told him to stay put while I talked some things over with the White Glove folks.
AAD00103423	He was never one to stay tied down to a spot, though. Gets that from his mother.
AAD00103424	Got most of my staff out looking for him now. I'd be out myself, but I keep hoping he'll show up back here.
AAD00103425	Course if he does that I'll whup him till his skinny hide turns to leather for putting me through this. But that don't mean I wouldn't be grateful.
AAD00103426	I'd like to help you with your debt collection.
AAD00103427	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AAD00103428	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
AAD00103429	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AAD00103430	<Speech more money>
AAD00103431	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AAD00103432	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here. 50/50 and I'm game.
AAD00103433	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AAD00103434	Twenty-five percent?! Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
AAD00103435	You've got yourself a deal.
AAD00103436	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AAD00103437	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
AAD00103438	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
AAD00103439	Eh, sorry. I've got some other things I need to handle first.
AAD00103440	Do you have any work you need done around here?
AAD00103441	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
AAD00103442	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
AAD00103443	I'd like a room.
AAD00103444	Just a few caps and it's yours.
AAD00103445	I'm not a kid, old man.
AAD00103446	You've got a mouth on you, kid. If I weren't busy working for the Garrets, I might give you a few lessons in common courtesy. Get lost.
AAD00103447	Marjorie said you gave a free room to a private investigator.
AAD00103448	Private investigator... Ah, yes. I remember the gentleman.
AAD00103449	This was about the missing bride. Such an awful thing. I do hope he finds her whereabouts.
AAD00103450	If I might pry, have you found something that will help his investigation?
AAD00103451	How's business?
AAD00103452	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Good selection from traders and the Van Graffs keep things running.
AAD00103453	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Van Graffs getting killed is making a mess of things, but we have other customers.
AAD00103454	I found this ledger that proves some of your side business.
AAD00103455	Where the fuck did you get that? Okay, listen buddy... That's some dangerous shit you got there.
AAD00103456	That book can get me killed if the wrong people see it. Let's talk, what do you want? What can I do for you?
AAD00103457	I hear you've been dealing with some business that is off limits for the family.
AAD00103458	I don't give half a dick what you've heard. Now get the fuck out of my face before I burn your sorry ass.
AAD00103459	The Omertas won't take kindly to hearing about your relationship with Joana.
AAD00103460	Joana? That bitch spreading lies about me? I've got a lesson to teach her about loose lips.
AAD00103461	I've got evidence that Benny tried to kill me and stole a Platinum Chip from me.
AAD00103462	Whoa, hey now, kid, that's some kind of serious charge you're dropping. You want to be real careful what you say next.
AAD00103463	Yeah? What else you got?
AAD00103464	I've got more evidence that proves Benny tried to kill me.
AAD00103465	Who are you?
AAD00103466	Ain't been on the Strip long, have you, pal? Name's Swank. This is my joint.
AAD00103467	Every bit helps. Thanks.
AAD00103468	Hey wait! I just remembered something. I might've heard one of the guys that attacked us call another by name.
AAD00103469	We had just about had it when one of them said "Hey Lou, we gotta go." At least I think he said Lou. It might have been something else.
AAD00103470	Now that I think of it, he said Lou-something. Something with a "T". Tenant! That's what he called him. Lou Tenant.
AAD00103471	Not much. He seemed legit to me.
AAD00103472	Oh he did, did he? Well that just ain't good enough. Get back out there and hire him again. Hire him a hundred times if that's what it takes.
AAD00103473	And before you ask, I'm not gonna cover the cost this time. It's bad enough I'm giving the man *more* business.
AAD00103474	<Lie> Of course I act on behalf of Mr. House. Why else would I be here?
AAD00103475	<Lie> A messenger?... Why, yes! Of course, Mr. House and I go way, waaaay back.
AAD00103476	I'll help you. Do you have any landmarks in mind?
AAD00103477	I've always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AAD00103478	The McCarran Airfield and the HELIOS One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparilla Headquarters' bottle.
AAD00103479	Several years of psychoanalysis and a few thousand caps a month will fix you.
AAD00103480	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
AAD00103481	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? 150 caps is my final offer.
AAD00103482	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
AAD00103483	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
AAD00103484	You exhibit clear symptoms of acute agoraphobia. I can help.
AAD00103485	[SUCCEEDED] Ah, an educated fellow? Now that is almost as rare as artistry! So, how can you help me regain my inspiration?
AAD00103486	<Lie> So, uh, wasn't it clever how I tricked you? I'm... working for Mr. House!
AAD00103487	<Lie> You really believed I wasn't working for Mr. House? Chump.
AAD00103488	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might offer to, well, encourage discretion?
AAD00103489	I guess you're having trouble with Mr. House's requests. What's the problem?
AAD00103490	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
AAD00103491	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves! 150 caps is my final offer.
AAD00103492	Better cough up some caps or Mr. House finds out about your sorry excuses.
AAD00103493	[FAILED] Sorry excuses?... That does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
AAD00103494	Your failure would not amuse Mr. House. Unless I could be persuaded otherwise...
AAD00103495	Let's see... You've got that thingy... there. Power, uh, re-circulators here....
AAD00103496	Okay, I'll hire you.
AAD00103497	Done and done. I want to mention a few things up front. In order to ensure your safety, I need you to follow my instructions to the letter.
AAD00103498	We'll be heading down the main street here the whole way down. No detours. You go off sightseeing and I go off to find another customer.
AAD00103499	I'll keep a brisk pace, so try not to fall behind. Now let's head out.
AAD00103500	No way your materials and expenses require that. How about half?
AAD00103501	[SUCCEEDED] Hah! I like your style, kid, but the best I can do is meet you halfway. 375 caps, and we can call it a deal.
AAD00103502	[FAILED] Heh, who are you shitting?
AAD00103503	I appreciate your brass, but 500 is the price. Take it or leave it.
AAD00103504	Goodbye.
AAD00103505	Stop back if you need anything.
AAD00103506	How do you know what happened to the girl?
AAD00103507	Because I distracted her fiancй while they took her. Well, I'm not proud of it! But I had to. They could see I was having second thoughts.
AAD00103508	Some of the White Gloves began meeting privately a while back. Started talking about how we'd lost our identity.
AAD00103509	I started attending because I thought it was about changing our politics.
AAD00103510	Then they started talking about returning to the old ways, and there was no way out. They'd kill me for the things I heard them say.
AAD00103511	VFSJulieFarkasVoicesObjection
AAD00103512	The reasons for these attacks are yet unknown.
AAD00103513	It may be possible to avoid further bloodshed if you discover the cause at the root of this recent outbreak of violence.
AAD00103514	VFSJulieFarkasKingSuiteGreeting
AAD00103515	We've actually already met. It's good to see you again.
AAD00103516	What kind of specialist is Clanden?
AAD00103517	I got no fucking idea. They let him have the run of the place though. He seems like a nice guy, but he makes me nervous.
AAD00103518	He's a little arrogant, but he's too nice. Too open, I've never seen him fucking or gambling. Everyone has a vice, but this guy seems like the Pope.
AAD00103519	<Barter Option>
AAD00103520	[FAILED] Do I look like some kind of fool? I'm not paying you so you can double deal on me.
AAD00103521	Err... Well, if you give me everything you have, I'll consider making a deal.
AAD00103522	I think I'm going to keep this for a little while.
AAD00103523	All right, all right. I can't stop you, but I think we can help each other out.
AAD00103524	I know Not-At-Home and the NCR would be happy to get some dirt on the Family. I can help you get that dirt, and you got me by the short hairs.
AAD00103525	Do you think the Family would like to see this?
AAD00103526	I can't stop you, but that's gonna mean my death. I can make it worth your while to give it to me though.
AAD00103527	Plus, if you go to the bosses I can't help you stop what they've been doing.
AAD00103528	Is this journal worth 100 caps to you?
AAD00103529	Oh, here are some caps. Now give me the journal. Right, there we go. So let me tell you what I know about the Family's business.
AAD00103530	The Bosses, Big Sal and Nero, have been working for a while on this. They're arming themselves like an army, using this new guy, Troike.
AAD00103531	They also brought in a specialist named Clanden. At least that's what they introduced him as.
AAD00103532	Okay, 100 caps and you help me break up whatever your bosses have planned.
AAD00103533	He tried to make it look like an accident - just a traveler killed and robbed in the Wasteland.
AAD00103534	[SUCCEEDED] He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
AAD00103535	[FAILED] Kid, that doesn't even pretend to make sense. You want to try again?
AAD00103536	Benny's going to steal all of House's robots! Don't you see?
AAD00103537	Benny tried to kill me and stole a Platinum Chip I was hired to deliver.
AAD00103538	[FAILED] Kid, I think you really better shut up and stop making baseless accusations unless you got some proof. Well?
AAD00103539	Benny stole my chip! And he tried to kill me, Mr. House said so!
AAD00103540	That's it. What do you think?
AAD00103541	I think you might just be onto something here, kid. Tell you what, I can't actively back your play, but I'll keep the Chairmen off your back.
AAD00103542	I'll tell the doormen you're cool to pack heat inside - trust me, you're gonna need it.
AAD00103543	You'll still have to deal with Benny's private goon squad, though. I got no play with those cats. You want more help, I'll need more proof.
AAD00103544	Look, I found these cigarette butts by the grave he buried me in.
AAD00103545	Huh. Well, yeah, okay, these are Benny's brand, and they ain't too common. You got anything else?
AAD00103546	I took all the pictures you wanted. There was something about a reward...
AAD00103547	You have earned it, my friend! Now I can finally unveil my masterpieces to the world, all thanks to you. Come visit me again sometime.
AAD00103548	What landmarks did you want me to photograph?
AAD00103549	I've always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AAD00103550	The McCarran Airfield and the HELIOS One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparilla Headquarters' bottle.
AAD00103551	Tell me about yourself again.
AAD00103552	I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
AAD00103553	I'm glad we have an understanding. Now, do you have any landmarks in mind?
AAD00103554	I've always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
AAD00103555	The McCarran Airfield and the HELIOS One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparilla Headquarters' bottle.
AAD00103556	Okay, you've got a deal. I'll return with the pictures.
AAD00103557	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Goodbye.
AAD00103558	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Goodbye.
AAD00103559	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Goodbye.
AAD00103560	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Goodbye.
AAD00103561	I have a couple more questions.
AAD00103562	Okay, toss 'em at me.
AAD00103563	That's all the questions I have for now. I may have more later.
AAD00103564	Okay. You can find me here, or upstairs in my room. I'll let the muscle know you're a friend of mine. That should let you get around a little easier.
AAD00103565	Tell me about this Troike.
AAD00103566	He's a skittish little fucker. Spends half the day pumping his body full of chems and the other half pumping hookers with his willy.
AAD00103567	He has some kind of connections, so he's able to smuggle huge shipments of weapons into the Strip.
AAD00103568	The bosses got him by the short hairs. We covered up a hooker he killed while flying on some Psycho, so he gets us guns in exchange for not ratting.
AAD00103569	Actually, I'm looking for someone named Cachino.
AAD00103570	Get the fuck away from me. Don't ask me about Cachino.
AAD00103571	Deal.
AAD00103572	Follow me.
AAD00103573	What do you think about Benny?
AAD00103574	Benny? Ahh, he's an all right cat, you dig? He don't got much musical talent, but he knows how to run a business. When he's around, anyways.
AAD00103575	What do you do here?
AAD00103576	Well, apart from serving as a talent manager, show scheduler, and all-around man in charge of this fine theater, I happen to be its headline act.
AAD00103577	Every night from eight till midnight, come on by to see the Rad Pack Revue live, only right here at the Aces Theater!
AAD00103578	What's Benny planning to do with the Chip?
AAD00103579	Oh! He wants to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe.
AAD00103580	That should give me control over all Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I just do what Benny tells me - easy-peasy!
AAD00103581	Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope sent me with a security update for your radio.
AAD00103582	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by.
AAD00103583	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by. Odd that she'd send a civilian instead of a trooper, though.
AAD00103584	Listen here shitwad, tell me where I can find Cachino.
AAD00103585	Whoa, simmer down! Head over to Brimstone. I'll have him find you there.
AAD00103586	<Black Widow/Lady's Man Options>
AAD00103587	I bet you say that to all the girls. Yeah, head over to Brimstone, he'll find you there.
AAD00103588	A gorgeous lady like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
AAD00103589	Gorgeous, you can have anything you want from me. Cachino is in Brimstone.
AAD00103590	I bet a sexy lady like you could tell me where I could find someone named Cachino.
AAD00103591	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
AAD00103592	If I told you you have a beautiful body, would you tell me where Cachino is?
AAD00103593	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
AAD00103594	A handsome man like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
AAD00103595	Where can I find Cachino?
AAD00103596	Cachino? Get out of my face.
AAD00103597	Really? What kind of entertainment do you have?
AAD00103598	Well, acts are a bit thin on the ground right now, but every night from eight to midnight, we've got the Rad Pack Revue!
AAD00103599	Songs, dancing, jokes, we got it all!
AAD00103600	How am I supposed to get to the Strip?
AAD00103601	See the King. I'm sure he could work something out to get you in. You'll need to prove you're worth his time, but it'll be well worth it.
AAD00103602	<Barter>
AAD00103603	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
AAD00103604	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AAD00103605	This kind of work costs time and money. 50/50 would cover my expenses.
AAD00103606	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AAD00103607	Are you crazy?! I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
AAD00103608	I think I have all of the debts collected.
AAD00103609	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AAD00103610	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AAD00103611	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AAD00103612	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AAD00103613	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AAD00103614	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AAD00103615	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00103616	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00103617	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00103618	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00103619	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00103620	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00103621	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AAD00103622	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AAD00103623	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AAD00103624	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00103625	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00103626	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00103627	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00103628	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00103629	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00103630	Doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 388 caps...
AAD00103631	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
AAD00103632	It doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 600 caps...
AAD00103633	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
AAD00103634	Just give me what you have on you and they might accept it, knowing you're dead.
AAD00103635	<Speech>
AAD00103636	[FAILED] You think Santiago is susceptible to such idle threats? Santiago laughs at your silly bluff.
AAD00103637	I'm going to... Well, I'm sure it will be very painful if you don't pay.
AAD00103638	Santiago is dead if he doesn’t cough up what he owes the Garrets.
AAD00103639	Sir, Santiago does not know what he has done to offend, but he can explain everything.
AAD00103640	<Barter down 25 caps>
AAD00103641	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
AAD00103642	I don't even know this discount is worth 50. How about 25 caps?
AAD00103643	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
AAD00103644	What kind of moron would pay 50 caps for information? 25 caps.
AAD00103645	Francine warned me that you're a smooth-talker.
AAD00103646	Indeed, Santiago is a poet among pretenders. If you are here to collect for the Garrets, Santiago is debt free.
AAD00103647	You owe the Garrets a bunch of caps.
AAD00103648	Santiago does not owe anyone. Santiago is a Freeside VIP.
AAD00103649	Seriously, zombie, are you looking at me or someone off that direction?!
AAD00103650	<Press for clothing>
AAD00103651	[FAILED] You're freaking crazy. I'm not stripping for you. I'm already broke.
AAD00103652	You cheapass zombie. You need to pay my extra fee.
AAD00103653	<Press for extra caps>
AAD00103654	[FAILED] Hey, I'm tapped out, man. I've got nothing left but the clothes on my back.
AAD00103655	You cheapass zombie. You need to pay my extra fee.
AAD00103656	Anything unusual happening around here?
AAD00103657	All quiet at the moment. Ranger Beaumont is in charge here, but he's off leading a patrol.
AAD00103658	It was quiet until those rockets blasted off over our heads.
AAD00103659	There was a hell of a boom over at REPCONN. Looks like the ghouls had some sort of accident with their rockets.
AAD00103660	I'll pass.
AAD00103661	I completely understand. No reason you should take on someone else's problems. Let me know if you change your mind, though.
AAD00103662	Now, was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
AAD00103663	
AAD00103664	[FAILED] I've got a business to run here, you know. The price is 250.
AAD00103665	You want even more money? Are you insane?
AAD00103666	Do you know the password?
AAD00103667	It'll cost you 250 caps.
AAD00103668	Sorry, too rich for me.
AAD00103669	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
AAD00103670	Done.
AAD00103671	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
AAD00103672	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
AAD00103673	
AAD00103674	[SUCCEEDED] You're a scoundrel. I'll let it go for 50, but no lower.
AAD00103675	If you ever want me to buy another tip from you, that price'll come down.
AAD00103676	
AAD00103677	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
AAD00103678	You know anything about NCR soldiers prowling the area?
AAD00103679	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
AAD00103680	You still have some info on those NCR soldiers that have been about?
AAD00103681	Right here. <Give McCaffery's hat>
AAD00103682	This is great news. No one screws with the Garret Twins and gets away with it. I need to find a place on the wall for this.
AAD00103683	And for your reward... Here's 150 caps. I trust there were also some valuables on McCaffery. Also, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00103684	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's. Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00103685	I took care of McCaffery.
AAD00103686	Yes! Where is his hat?!
AAD00103687	I understand.
AAD00103688	Good luck.
AAD00103689	I could sneak in there and try to get your people out.
AAD00103690	You should wait until it's darker so that you have the best chance to pull this off.
AAD00103691	You should go now, while it's still dark. That way, you'll have the best chance to pull this off.
AAD00103692	I may be able to negotiate a deal with the Great Khans.
AAD00103693	Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are, but considering that the hostages are as good as dead when we attack...
AAD00103694	All right, I'm going to give you a chance to talk to the Great Khans. Their leader is a man named Jessup.
AAD00103695	If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in, but it'll probably be too late for you.
AAD00103696	I'd like to know more about the NCR.
AAD00103697	I seriously doubt that it would be in my best interest to discuss the NCR with someone of your reputation.
AAD00103698	What's happening around the Strip?
AAD00103699	You may have a penchant for getting into trouble, but I'd recommend against that here. The Securitrons on the Strip aren't to be trifled with.
AAD00103700	Perhaps I'll have Captain Pappas keep an eye on you. For your own safety, of course.
AAD00103701	Tell me about yourself, Ambassador.
AAD00103702	Interested in politics, huh? Well, grab a seat and get comfortable.
AAD00103703	I've been in politics quite a while now. Always had the drive to do it, even when I was young. It's just something I was drawn to.
AAD00103704	I started my career over twenty years ago back in the NCR as the local mayor and worked my way up from there.
AAD00103705	I managed President Kimball's first run for a seat on the Council. I suppose that's why I have this ambassadorship.
AAD00103706	Is there anything I can do to help?
AAD00103707	There is always something needing done. A few souls here in Freeside could be great assets to the community, if they'd kick their addictions.
AAD00103708	We need a regular supply of medicine organized, but the Crimson Caravan wants too many caps for what we need.
AAD00103709	Lastly, tensions between the townies and NCR tourists have been going downhill fast lately. A lot of innocent people will get hurt if things blow up.
AAD00103710	Do you have anything for sale?
AAD00103711	Sure. Take a look.
AAD00103712	Not for someone like you. My customers would shit a brick if they knew I sold anything to you.
AAD00103713	If you need any help cleaning up your rep around Freeside, I might be able to help... for a price.
AAD00103714	<Speech>
AAD00103715	[SUCCEEDED] Well, that sounds like a bit of a bargain. I get to walk free with the Garrets thinking I'm dead.
AAD00103716	Sure, you can have my hat. I can always buy another with the caps I've got left.
AAD00103717	It would have been more fun fighting it out, though. See you later, kid.
AAD00103718	All I need is your hat, and you're a free man. I'll tell Francine you're dead.
AAD00103719	The Followers are looking to trade for supplies.
AAD00103720	Interesting... Well, you're going to need to speak with my brother James. He handles all of the trading contracts and general operations.
AAD00103721	Julie Farkas sent me to help you sober up.
AAD00103722	Julie? Ah, I love Julie. She's such a nice lady.
AAD00103723	One time, I was working on the water pump and she came over, put her hand on my shoulder, and told me I was doing a great job. Great job, she says!
AAD00103724	I just choked up and didn't say nothing. Compliments are so rare these days.
AAD00103725	How's business?
AAD00103726	With Jacob Hoff sobered up, there are new drinks on the menu and sales are strong. People love the new Absinthe and Rum & Nuka.
AAD00103727	I spoke with Julie Farkas. She says the Followers will accept your offer.
AAD00103728	Hey, that's great. We'll get some supplies sent over today as a show of good faith.
AAD00103729	Once our stills are upgraded, we'll never be short on liquor for our patrons. If Jacob Hoff is sober, we might even have a few new drinks on tap.
AAD00103730	Most might view us as drug dealing enablers around here, but honestly we care about our patrons. It's bad business for people to get addicted.
AAD00103731	We've got enough crime in Freeside without a bunch of strung-out junkies robbing traders and gamblers to afford their next fix.
AAD00103732	You get your chems and can help anyone who gets addicted.
AAD00103733	True, we could help addicts, but the cycle of addiction, recovery, and relapse would remain.
AAD00103734	The troopers are all dead. You're free to go.
AAD00103735	Yeah, that's a pretty piece of work. Makes me wonder why you'd turn on the NCR, especially when they had us cold.
AAD00103736	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AAD00103737	Well, I've got that right here.
AAD00103738	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
AAD00103739	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they'll help me through this.
AAD00103740	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
AAD00103741	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they'll help me through this.
AAD00103742	What do you need?
AAD00103743	At least a couple of doses of Fixer, a bottle of whiskey, and RadAway.
AAD00103744	I can take doses of Fixer and RadAway to gradually flush my system over time while drinking decreasing shots of diluted whiskey.
AAD00103745	This shit better be worth it, man.
AAD00103746	You won't be seeing Dixon anymore.
AAD00103747	What the hell? Why? I need alcohol, man!
AAD00103748	I'm gonna die if I don't get a drink!
AAD00103749	Nevermind. I don't have enough to cover that.
AAD00103750	Heh, you sorry sad sack. Come back when you've got the caps.
AAD00103751	<Speech>
AAD00103752	[FAILED] Wow, you really suck at this don't you? Go bully some molerats, jackass.
AAD00103753	If you don't leave them alone... I'll... I'll tell on you!
AAD00103754	All right. Take the caps and leave them alone.
AAD00103755	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mr. Moneybags.
AAD00103756	Good luck getting them healthy. If they don't get a whole lot of Fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
AAD00103757	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mrs. Moneybags.
AAD00103758	Good luck getting them healthy. If they don't get a whole lot of Fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
AAD00103759	<Attack>
AAD00103760	Ooo, I always enjoy a good scrap!
AAD00103761	<Attack> Screw that. It'd be a lot cheaper and easier for me to kill you.
AAD00103762	<Lie> I'm here to talk business. Interested in putting out a cookbook?
AAD00103763	[SUCCEEDED] What, me? The supreme ruler of the Nevada dining scene? Teach some lowlife half-wits how to make food that doesn't smell like burning excrement?
AAD00103764	Do you think it would sell?
AAD00103765	How did the family find out about it?
AAD00103766	When I saw the body I started screaming. In a few seconds, some of their soldiers were in there cleaning up the room.
AAD00103767	They offered to keep silent about what happened if I agreed to help them get their hands on large quantities of guns, at deep discounts.
AAD00103768	What kind of chems were you doing?
AAD00103769	That night? Mostly Buffout. I like to cut it with a little bit of Jet, and wash it down with some whiskey. That was my standard Saturday night...
AAD00103770	About that thing you wanted to talk about, let's hear it.
AAD00103771	Uh... no word yet. I'll get back to you on it.
AAD00103772	Please let me know as soon as you can.
AAD00103773	Uh... I'm not sure. I'll get back to you.
AAD00103774	I'll find them and talk to them.
AAD00103775	Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, come back and let me know if they will help us.
AAD00103776	I know where they are. I'll go and talk to them.
AAD00103777	Excellent, come back after you've spoken to them. They should see the benefits of helping us in the long term.
AAD00103778	I've met with the Boomers. I don't think it'll work out.
AAD00103779	Actually, I already know them. We're good friends.
AAD00103780	That's excellent news! So they'll help us, right?
AAD00103781	Sorry, I'm not interested.
AAD00103782	Sorry to hear that, but do me a favor and give it some more thought. I'll be here if you change your mind.
AAD00103783	I'm listening.
AAD00103784	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible so we don't waste each other's time.
AAD00103785	The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that's going on with Mr. House and the Legion.
AAD00103786	And despite your reputation and previous actions with the NCR, we could use your help.
AAD00103787	<VMS23 Boomer Quest>
AAD00103788	I'm glad you could make it! I have something I wanted to discuss with you.
AAD00103789	It's a very important matter, and I have a strong feeling you're the perfect person for the job.
AAD00103790	You received my message. Good. I realize that it may seem a little strange that I'm contacting you, considering your reputation...
AAD00103791	But I have a business proposition I'd like to discuss with you.
AAD00103792	I wanted to talk to you about the Boomers.
AAD00103793	I'm glad to see you've given it some more thought. So, are you willing to go talk to them and see if they will help us?
AAD00103794	What's the word with the Boomers? Have you talked to them yet?
AAD00103795	Use Medicine skill to surmise House's condition.
AAD00103796	[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several textbooks...
AAD00103797	Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer them to others, such as yourself.
AAD00103798	The lifespan you're claiming is impossible, except for ghouls and Super Mutants.
AAD00103799	[Barter] for better terms.
AAD00103800	[SUCCEEDED] Very well, five times the bonus. Not one cap more.
AAD00103801	It's a good start... but well below market price.
AAD00103802	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
AAD00103803	I've always taken business negotiations very seriously. I advise you to do the same.
AAD00103804	Raise your price or... or, uh... you're "chip outta luck."
AAD00103805	No thanks.
AAD00103806	My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligates you to deliver the Chip.
AAD00103807	I accept your terms.
AAD00103808	Well enough. Return to me when you have the Platinum Chip in your possession. Any final matters for us to discuss?
AAD00103809	Sarah, I plan on staying here often - got a special price for a special client?
AAD00103810	[SUCCEEDED] Well. Sure! You seem pretty special. But that'll be our secret, okay?
AAD00103811	I would like a room, please.
AAD00103812	All right! We have an available room for you. That will be just 20 caps.
AAD00103813	A special room for a special client!
AAD00103814	For The Strip VIPs, like you, I've got just the right room - at half the price.
AAD00103815	My shop's open for you, but not my Vault. I don't need troublemakers staying at my home, no thanks.
AAD00103816	Having you tonight is my pleasure. Your room is ready!
AAD00103817	I was hoping you might have some work for me.
AAD00103818	I did have something, but some friends of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
AAD00103819	<Science>
AAD00103820	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
AAD00103821	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
AAD00103822	1C 3C R34 M.
AAD00103823	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
AAD00103824	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
AAD00103825	1C 3C R34 M.
AAD00103826	[FAILED] Please submit to a credit check or present a passport.
AAD00103827	Robot! Let me past!
AAD00103828	You said you could spare some supplies?
AAD00103829	Sure. Would you like a Stimpak, Fixer, or RadAway?
AAD00103830	I helped with that addiction problem you mentioned.
AAD00103831	I saw them. Thank you so much for helping them. This means a lot to the Followers of the Apocalypse. You have our thanks.
AAD00103832	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a Stim or Fixer once a day.
AAD00103833	I saw Bill, but found Jacob dead. His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
AAD00103834	Thank you for helping Bill. At least he will help repair things around here.
AAD00103835	I saw Jacob, but found Bill dead... His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
AAD00103836	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a Stim or Fixer once a day.
AAD00103837	What can you tell me about Captain Pappas?
AAD00103838	She may be a bit of a hardass, but she's the best damn Captain we've had here. I'd be careful around her. You don't want to get on her bad side.
AAD00103839	If you're digging for dirt on the Captain, you're digging in the wrong place.
AAD00103840	Tell me about Private Erwin.
AAD00103841	Private Erwin... yeah, he's starting to get a thick file here with all his troublemaking.
AAD00103842	My troopers are my business. Stay out of it.
AAD00103843	What can you tell me about the Ambassador?
AAD00103844	Eh, Crocker isn't too bad. He mostly stays in his office now. If you have any questions about the Embassy you should ask him. He'll talk your ear off.
AAD00103845	What is happening on the Strip?
AAD00103846	More of the usual. We're keeping an eye on the troopers to make sure they don't do anything stupid.
AAD00103847	The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause more trouble than he's worth.
AAD00103848	How the hell did brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
AAD00103849	I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarrassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
AAD00103850	I'm looking for the Ambassador.
AAD00103851	Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right and at the end of the hall.
AAD00103852	Fine, but don't keep me waiting.
AAD00103853	Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
AAD00103854	And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
AAD00103855	Here's the key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
AAD00103856	VFSGrecksHello
AAD00103857	Those rat-bastard Garrets stopped offering tabs. Now where the hell am I supposed to go for free drinks?
AAD00103858	VFSHighTimesDealerHello
AAD00103859	Friggin' troll NCR squatters. A bunch of mouth-breathing wastes of space, if you ask me.
AAD00103860	VFSJacobHoffHello
AAD00103861	Got any chems, sir? I need a hit quick!
AAD00103862	<Securitron Dialog>
AAD00103863	Howdy, pardner! You've come a far piece, haven't you? Welcome to New Vegas!
AAD00103864	I'd like to ask about something else instead.
AAD00103865	Oh, yes, sure sure. Ask away.
AAD00103866	Interesting, go on.
AAD00103867	Go on.
AAD00103868	Now we mostly just keep track of the NCR citizens and troopers around and make sure they don't get in trouble, but that's Captain Pappas' job.
AAD00103869	I keep myself busy with paperwork and reports that get sent back to the NCR. It's mostly busy work, but every once in a while, we make progress.
AAD00103870	That's enough history for me.
AAD00103871	Have you seen Benny?
AAD00103872	It was a while ago! He came through here in a real hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
AAD00103873	When's the last time you saw Benny?
AAD00103874	Sure! He came through here in a big hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
AAD00103875	He was around here not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
AAD00103876	You can wait for him here, if you like. I'm incapable of asking you to leave.
AAD00103877	You know, leather is my specialty. Unzip it, heat it and rub a shine onto it.
AAD00103878	Vault gear - swell. Can you show me what you got?
AAD00103879	Oh, yeah, sure!
AAD00103880	Okay - I got these great lunchboxes, they're super! What else? Oh-oh! Look at these toasters! You like toasts, right? If they are crunchy even better!
AAD00103881	What about a vintage Vault-Tec toy car? Or-
AAD00103882	I want to join the White Glove Society. I was told I'd need a sponsor.
AAD00103883	And you most certainly fit the bill. Given your deeds on the Strip alone, I can safely say that you would be a prized addition to our honorary ranks.
AAD00103884	Mmm. You'll have to look elsewhere, I'm afraid. The whole idea of "joining" the White Glove Society is pure hogwash.
AAD00103885	You're either in it, or you're not. There's no joining.
AAD00103886	This "honorary member" nonsense is just something Marjorie contrived because she's so preoccupied with image. But it's only a fad.
AAD00103887	Once it blows over, the riff-raff we've temporarily inducted will be shown the door. So I wouldn't hold out hope if I were you.
AAD00103888	I have some more questions about Vault 21.
AAD00103889	Do you miss the old days in the vault?
AAD00103890	It was bustling with activity! We all knew each other so well - you see, the vault kept us all even. It's all symmetry and windows down there.
AAD00103891	We solved any quarrels through gambling! Lady Luck casts no eyeballs, you know? So, nobody shafted anyone else!
AAD00103892	Yeah... I miss those days!
AAD00103893	Why did he fill the vault with concrete?
AAD00103894	I don't know! Maybe he didn't want anybody sneaking around down there.
AAD00103895	My vault runs deep and wide! It's filled with corridors and rooms that go far.
AAD00103896	What gives him the right to screw us with the royal shaft, anyway? So, he saved New Vegas. Woohooo! Now scram and let us go on with our lives! Sheesh!
AAD00103897	You have never actually left this place?
AAD00103898	Sure I have! I made the scene in The Strip. It's just that I really like it here - Vault 21 is a kick!
AAD00103899	What is so special about this vault?
AAD00103900	My vault is pure New Vegas. Everyone has a chance and Lady Luck smiles if you play your odds right!... Okay, it was like that before we had to leave.
AAD00103901	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
AAD00103902	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
AAD00103903	What is this memorial?
AAD00103904	It commemorates the Battle of Hoover Dam. The Rangers lured the best of Caesar's Legion into Boulder City, then blew the whole town up.
AAD00103905	The NCR still lost a bunch of troops in the fighting, though. My older brother sacrificed himself so they could evacuate some of the wounded.
AAD00103906	
AAD00103907	[FAILED] Nothing you can threaten me with holds a candle to what the Omertas would do to me if they caught me.
AAD00103908	You deploy the Thermite or I'll punch you in the shoulder.
AAD00103909	Where do the guns come from?
AAD00103910	I've made a lot of contacts over the years. I have some friends back in California that can get their hands on just about anything.
AAD00103911	Mostly I've been calling in every last favor I have.
AAD00103912	What can we do to take care of the guns?
AAD00103913	As a little pet project, I've been making some thermite. Thermite burns as hot as the devil's asshole and can melt through just about anything.
AAD00103914	I've been keeping it so if the Family betrays me I can hopefully do some damage before I end up dead or in jail.
AAD00103915	How do you get the guns into the Strip?
AAD00103916	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
AAD00103917	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
AAD00103918	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
AAD00103919	From there, it took just a couple of greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
AAD00103920	Yes.
AAD00103921	Oh. Great! The Followers of the Apocalypse, well some of us, anyway, have been interested in Mr. House's technology, how he stays alive.
AAD00103922	Of course, no one else is allowed inside the Lucky 38, so no one knows what's going on. Well, except for you.
AAD00103923	
AAD00103924	[SUCCEEDED] We don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Alright, we'll give them a little bit of extra business.
AAD00103925	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
AAD00103926	[FAILED] They're small timers, I could give a fuck what they would enjoy.
AAD00103927	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
AAD00103928	
AAD00103929	[SUCCEEDED] Really? That was his idea? Alright, he can go. Hopefully he finds us some good deals out there.
AAD00103930	<Lie> Troike wants to see about negotiating some lower prices for weapons for you guys.
AAD00103931	[FAILED] You're real funny. I like you. But no. We still have business for Troike.
AAD00103932	Um... I'm sure you have enough guns.
AAD00103933	The President is coming to Hoover Dam?
AAD00103934	It's probably just a political thing - you know, give a few speeches, shake hands with the troops, boost morale.
AAD00103935	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
AAD00103936	It's one of the biggest sources of electrical power in the region, so the NCR's fortified the place pretty heavily.
AAD00103937	When President Kimball shows up on his inspection tour, I'm sure he'll be confident that the Dam is safe and secure.
AAD00103938	Where did you say the investigator's room was, again?
AAD00103939	If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
AAD00103940	
AAD00103941	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll take care of them. Just give me the word when to start shooting.
AAD00103942	They are going to expect something from me. You can do it and surprise them.
AAD00103943	[FAILED] If you aren't a good shot then we're fucked anyways. No, I think you're going to have to do it.
AAD00103944	I'm not a very good shot. You should kill them.
AAD00103945	What happens when the bosses are gone?
AAD00103946	When they're gone, I'm gonna run this joint. Don't worry, I'll take care of this place.
AAD00103947	I have some questions about the Bosses plans.
AAD00103948	Alright, let's have them.
AAD00103949	
AAD00103950	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like a deal to me.
AAD00103951	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
AAD00103952	[FAILED] Yeah, but come back when you have the money.
AAD00103953	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
AAD00103954	Okay, 300 caps is a deal.
AAD00103955	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks, you ain't never seen me before.
AAD00103956	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks, you ain't never seen me before.
AAD00103957	I need more film for the camera.
AAD00103958	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
AAD00103959	Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this, "my pleasure" that.
AAD00103960	Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
AAD00103961	What makes you think you can succeed?
AAD00103962	Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are.
AAD00103963	I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got a lot to learn, but it's... it's coming together.
AAD00103964	It's a deal.
AAD00103965	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
AAD00103966	Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
AAD00103967	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
AAD00103968	Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
AAD00103969	
AAD00103970	Looks like I should think about quitting...
AAD00103971	You left these at my grave. <Show Benny his cigarette butts.>
AAD00103972	Fill me in about the NCR.
AAD00103973	A nation of meddlers, trying to muscle in on our action. Well, we got muscles too, and smarts besides.
AAD00103974	Only reason the NCR hasn't busted up our scene is they're a little afraid of Mr. House, and a lot afraid of Caesar.
AAD00103975	If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them - not yet.
AAD00103976	Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are our best customers. It's complicated.
AAD00103977	Tell me about Mr. House.
AAD00103978	A good cat to swing with. Or was - until he stopped mewing.
AAD00103979	It was House's big idea to resurrect the Strip. He recruited the Three Families as muscle, showed us how to set up casinos, negotiated with the NCR.
AAD00103980	None of this in person, mind you. Did all of his talking through those Securitrons of his. But lately? The silence is deafening.
AAD00103981	The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
AAD00103982	What's the deal with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
AAD00103983	You really weren't supposed to talk to him...
AAD00103984	All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest, until I gave him a mickey in the shape of a pulse grenade.
AAD00103985	Once he was on the nod, I yanked some wires and dragged him up to the workshop. I had... some help, you see.
AAD00103986	Gal named Emily, one of the Followers over in Freeside, a real whiz when it comes to things technical. She programmed his personality.
AAD00103987	Once Yes Man was hooked back in to House's data network, I started learning a lot more about what he was up to, dig? Like where and when to find you.
AAD00103988	Orris left town after I had a little talk with him.
AAD00103989	Convinced him, huh? I could use more men with your powers of persuasion.
AAD00103990	You've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
AAD00103991	
AAD00103992	[FAILED] I think I'll keep my money, thanks. You take that fanciful tale of yours wherever you'd like. Now let's go. I have a job to finish.
AAD00103993	You should give me all your money. Or I'll tell. And stuff.
AAD00103994	After you.
AAD00103995	Stay close. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
AAD00103996	VFSSecuritronHalt
AAD00103997	You have entered a restricted area! Exit the gate area or you will be fired upon!
AAD00103998	You have my attention, go on.
AAD00103999	To the northeast is a settlement, the locals here call them "Boomers." They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
AAD00104000	I would like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
AAD00104001	Unfortunately, the Boomers keep to themselves and are, let's say, hostile to all outsiders. That's why I need someone like you.
AAD00104002	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
AAD00104003	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
AAD00104004	Do you think you would be able to do this for me?
AAD00104005	I think I'll be leaving.
AAD00104006	You are the first person to step foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. It was not an invitation I made lightly.
AAD00104007	We have a serious matter to discuss concerning a contract you have yet to fulfill.
AAD00104008	Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist.
AAD00104009	Oh, I assure you, sir, they are very real and very large. Please do be careful.
AAD00104010	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
AAD00104011	It is so rare to meet good, friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
AAD00104012	<Lady Killer>
AAD00104013	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, you charming, wonderful hunk of a man. I agree, I cannot risk my reputation on such a paltry sum.
AAD00104014	Here is what I owe, paid in full. I may scrape a bit to get home to California, but I'm a resourceful woman.
AAD00104015	Here is the last known location of my caravan, if you feel like looking for it. Until we meet again, handsome.
AAD00104016	Jane, surely a lady of your stature has honor sufficient to pay her debts.
AAD00104017	Benny has reprogrammed a Securitron. He's trying to take over the Strip.
AAD00104018	I've bugged the tower for you.
AAD00104019	Good to hear, but it looks like the bug was deactivated a few minutes after it went online.
AAD00104020	It looks like House has some kind of countermeasure in place to prevent evesdropping on his network. We'll get through eventually, just not today.
AAD00104021	Here are those medical supplies I promised. Hopefully you won't need to use them. Take care.
AAD00104022	It looks like we've started getting reports from the tower's network! I'm sure the others will be able to make some sense of this.
AAD00104023	Oh what the hell? The bug went offline! Dammit!
AAD00104024	I swear to God that old man has thought of everything. Well, it looks like this was all for nothing, but you did your best. I appreciate the help.
AAD00104025	All right. I'm on it.
AAD00104026	Really? Oh, I wasn't expecting you to agree so easily. That's great!
AAD00104027	Here, take this packet sniffer. It'll allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
AAD00104028	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
AAD00104029	
AAD00104030	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? I like you. Half the people around here, they forget who runs this place.
AAD00104031	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
AAD00104032	I'm new in town, and wanted to pay my respects.
AAD00104033	Let's talk about something else.
AAD00104034	What do you want to talk about?
AAD00104035	What happens if the Platinum Chip is lost?
AAD00104036	If the Chip's so valuable, why use a single courier to transport it?
AAD00104037	You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them dummies, so to speak?
AAD00104038	Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach.
AAD00104039	Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world, "This is important. Attack this!"
AAD00104040	I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.
AAD00104041	I have a right to know more.
AAD00104042	That's simply not true.
AAD00104043	I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly.
AAD00104044	To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting.
AAD00104045	For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it. And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here.
AAD00104046	We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.
AAD00104047	Now you need to settle that debt with the Garrets.
AAD00104048	Sir, Santiago told you. Santiago has no debts.
AAD00104049	<Speech>
AAD00104050	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
AAD00104051	50 caps without even knowing the details of this code? How about 25?
AAD00104052	<Speech>
AAD00104053	I apologize, friend, but that is absurd given the value of this information.
AAD00104054	Give it to me for free, now!
AAD00104055	Do you have any work you need done?
AAD00104056	We've got the basics covered, but now you mention it, we have had unusual requests from some of our wealthier customers.
AAD00104057	If you can recruit escorts to match these customers'... proclivities... I'd be willing to pay you finder's fees.
AAD00104058	Actually, I have some other business to take care of.
AAD00104059	
AAD00104060	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, that sounds fair.
AAD00104061	I'll give it to you for 200 caps.
AAD00104062	[FAILED] I'm not sure if you're funny or just stupid, but I'm not amused. Make me a real offer and we can talk.
AAD00104063	You give me 4500 caps and I'll let you look at the proof I found.
AAD00104064	<Speech>
AAD00104065	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
AAD00104066	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
AAD00104067	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
AAD00104068	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
AAD00104069	[FAILED] I don't have any more than that to give! I'm sorry!
AAD00104070	Hey, you made me look like a fool!
AAD00104071	I'm going to kill you now.
AAD00104072	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
AAD00104073	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!

AAD00104075	I know boss, and I know it's going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
AAD00104076	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
AAD00104077	I'm hardly a whirlwind of death when left to my own devices, but all right.
AAD00104078	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
AAD00104079	Understood. I won't hesitate.
AAD00104080	Beats waiting till they shoot me first.
AAD00104081	<Makes beeping sounds>

AAD00104083	<Makes beeping sounds>
AAD00104084	<Aggression Level::Aggressive>
AAD00104085	<growl>
AAD00104086	I'll do like I'm doing then - except I'll try to smile less.
AAD00104087	What, was I not doing it right before?
AAD00104088	Got a habit of repeating yourself.
AAD00104089	Never get tired of hearing that.
AAD00104090	Now we're talking.
AAD00104091	With a smile.
AAD00104092	That's exactly what Leo told me to do!
AAD00104093	Actually, I was curious if you sell chlorine to The Ultra-Luxe.
AAD00104094	Funny you should mention that, I do have a bit of chlorine here.
AAD00104095	Normally I wouldn't sell that to just anyone, but you were so helpful getting us Omerta business again, I'll set some aside for you to buy.
AAD00104096	I do, but that's some dangerous stuff. I don't sell it to just anyone, I have to be a responsible businessman.
AAD00104097	
AAD00104098	[FAILED] Yeah, I could build a nuke, but I'm not looking to turn the Mojave into a giant mirror.
AAD00104099	No, I was thinking something more subtle.
AAD00104100	Er... Maybe you could build a nuke?
AAD00104101	The Bosses sent me to offer you assistance.
AAD00104102	Oh, that's great. I sure could use some help. You see, I do explosives, and they have a special need for some big explosions.
AAD00104103	Problem is, there's no way I can get enough explosives to do the type of damage they're looking to do, much less get it all deployed.
AAD00104104	What was Cachino's role in the plan?
AAD00104105	As one of our captains, Cachino was kind of a project manager. He made sure people had what they needed to get their jobs done.
AAD00104106	Cachino was my Man Friday. He took care of what needed to be taken care of. Had no idea what a dumb son of a bitch he was.
AAD00104107	Let's talk about something else.
AAD00104108	Tell me about the plan.
AAD00104109	We call it Racket, and it is going to show Not-At-Home and every other fucker in our business just what the Family can do.
AAD00104110	What kind of help do you need?
AAD00104111	Two of the players, Troike and Clanden, have some problems that need to be solved. Ask them what they need.
AAD00104112	We have two contractors, a guy named Troike and one named Clanden. They've both been running into some issues. I'd appreciate it if you helped them out.
AAD00104113	How are you getting the weapons into the Strip?
AAD00104114	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
AAD00104115	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
AAD00104116	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
AAD00104117	From there, it took just a couple of greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
AAD00104118	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.

AAD00104122	
AAD00104123	[FAILED] I don't know much about biology, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't make a damn bit of sense.
AAD00104124	I... Um... Need it to make chlorophyll for plants...
AAD00104125	Keep up the attitude soon you'll be on the ground, for good.
AAD00104126	[SUCCEEDED] Hey... I'm just worked up, okay. You're tough, right? You won't care about my stupid rambling then?
AAD00104127	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
AAD00104128	Yes, sir!
AAD00104129	Yes, ma'am!
AAD00104130	If I give you his card, what's in it for me?
AAD00104131	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's only right you get a little something for your troubles. Here - my daddy left me this gun. Guess I don't need it no more.
AAD00104132	I'm giving you a real opportunity here - how about some compensation?
AAD00104133	[FAILED] I'm sure Mr. Torini already took care of your fee. Maybe you ought to talk to him. Much obliged for the opportunity, friend. See you around.
AAD00104134	Here, take his card. Tell him I sent you.
AAD00104135	Much obliged to you, friend.
AAD00104136	Tommy Torini at the Tops is looking for musical acts, if you're interested.
AAD00104137	Like I said, I got no reason to take your charity. Not till I know you better.
AAD00104138	I found the sexbot you're looking for.
AAD00104139	You did? Hot damn! I've been looking for one of those for years!
AAD00104140	For my customers, I mean... I'm not into that kind of shit.
AAD00104141	Woohoo! <assume the position>
AAD00104142	Servos active!
AAD00104143	Never mind, I would like a refund.
AAD00104144	Very well. Please return if you require further service.
AAD00104145	Interested in working for the Garrets?
AAD00104146	They already have that pig McCaffery working for them. Do they need another guard?
AAD00104147	Still trying to convince me, huh?
AAD00104148	If you're looking for work, Tommy Torini is hiring singers at the Tops.
AAD00104149	Really? The Tops, huh? Well, it's no Shark Club, but I hear security on the Strip is real tight. Even Mr. Bishop wouldn't hit a joint like that.
AAD00104150	I'll check it out. Thanks!
AAD00104151	Why would this Mr. Bishop be after you?
AAD00104152	Oh, well, that's all just a big misunderstanding, see.
AAD00104153	Mr. Bishop, well, he owed me a lot of money, and, y'know, he's a busy guy, so I sort of figured I'd just... take it off his hands.
AAD00104154	Why did you come all the way out here from New Reno?
AAD00104155	You don't know Mr. Bishop. He's not like other bosses up there. He knows the Wasteland like the back of his hand, and he likes to wander it.
AAD00104156	I knew if I didn't get way the hell away from New Reno, he'd run me down like a dog.
AAD00104157	Billy's worth three times what you're paying him.
AAD00104158	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
AAD00104159	[FAILED] Baby, you've got to be joking!
AAD00104160	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
AAD00104161	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
AAD00104162	[FAILED] Baby, you've got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
AAD00104163	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
AAD00104164	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
AAD00104165	[FAILED] Baby, you've got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
AAD00104166	Sure, here's his card.
AAD00104167	Sweet daisies, here I come!
AAD00104168	Don't sell yourself short. You're worth a lot more than that.
AAD00104169	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, geez, what was I thinking? You're right, I oughta go in there with a cool head, tell them how much I'm really worth.
AAD00104170	[FAILED] Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but you don't know what it's like.
AAD00104171	They offer me a roof over my head and half a Fancy Lad and I'll fold like a classy napkin, ay, it's true.
AAD00104172	No, you've got to start high! Ask for a million and go from there!
AAD00104173	So you're looking for your big break?
AAD00104174	A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts, I'll take the shells!
AAD00104175	But we're standing on a street corner in the middle of nowhere.
AAD00104176	That's exactly my point, kid. Exactly my point!
AAD00104177	Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring entertainers. I could put in a word for you.
AAD00104178	Yeah? Hey, you're all right! Tell him I'll do it for a hundred a night! No! Fifty! No, twenty! Ten!
AAD00104179	Just don't rob me, I'll do it!
AAD00104180	Hey, I'm happy to get any kind of work I can.
AAD00104181	Have you reconsidered asking for a better price from Tommy?
AAD00104182	How long have you been doing comedy?
AAD00104183	If you believe my mother, since she first laid eyes on me. First thing she said was "Boy! That's a funny-looking kid!"
AAD00104184	I guess I got a face only a mother could love, because nobody else would give me the time of day.
AAD00104185	Hey-Maybe you can help me, see, I can never tell when it's lunchtime.
AAD00104186	Who are you?
AAD00104187	The name's Knight. Billy Knight. And this here is what a lifelong career in comedy will get you, hoi.
AAD00104188	I just have a few questions.
AAD00104189	All right, but make it snappy, kid, this isn't exactly a lucrative career enterprise here.
AAD00104190	Tommy Torini is hiring new acts at the Tops. I think you could make good money.
AAD00104191	Really? You mean I'm finally out of this shithole? That's great! Thank you!
AAD00104192	Garret's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops.
AAD00104193	Sure, why not? Nothing left for me here since Garret's dead.
AAD00104194	That's what your mom said last night. Aw yeah. I went there.
AAD00104195	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, not bad! Your timing's terrible and you got no style, but you might make it as a professional heckler.
AAD00104196	Why bother? You're embarrassing yourself enough as it is.
AAD00104197	Watch your mouth, ghoul, or I might just rip your jaw off.
AAD00104198	Whoa, Nelly! There's insult comedy and then there's psycho comedy! I guess you aren't the heckler Garret hired to spice up my show. What do you want?
AAD00104199	<Speech>
AAD00104200	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AAD00104201	Ralph, I've been a loyal customer to you and Mick. How about 100 caps?
AAD00104202	<Barter>
AAD00104203	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
AAD00104204	Data modules are rare but generally useless. How about 100 caps for your work?
AAD00104205	[FAILED] That is just an insult to my expertise. My work is worth more than that.
AAD00104206	50 caps is my best offer.
AAD00104207	Is the holotape ready yet?
AAD00104208	Not yet. Come back later and it should be ready to go.
AAD00104209	A fight broke out when I presented Hsu's offer. The Kings are all dead.
AAD00104210	That's terrible. I suppose the violence against our people will stop, though.
AAD00104211	I'll have to spend much of the remaining funds for this operation on damage control, but I can spare this much as compensation for your efforts.
AAD00104212	The King accepted Colonel Hsu's offer of help.
AAD00104213	Good, good. Hsu's a man you can count on to handle a crisis. I'm just glad that things didn't end in violence.
AAD00104214	Here, this is what remains of the funds initially allocated for this operation.
AAD00104215	The Kings were all killed after the King turned down the ultimatum.
AAD00104216	I was afraid this would happen. Freeside will be a little more dangerous for a while, but eventually things will die down.
AAD00104217	I expect few people will purposely target NCR citizens for some time to come, which is a relief.
AAD00104218	However, the NCR's reputation has taken a huge blow because of this. People are beginning to see not much difference between us and the Legion.
AAD00104219	I've been authorized to give you this for your efforts. It's not much, but most of the funds for this operation are now going toward damage control.
AAD00104220	The King complied with Colonel Moore's ultimatum.
AAD00104221	How unexpected! I was sure direct confrontation would lead to more fighting, but I'm delighted to be proven wrong.
AAD00104222	I wouldn't be surprised if you had something to do with the situation not flaring up, either. Here, I'm sure you deserve every one of these caps.
AAD00104223	
AAD00104224	[FAILED] I'm sorry, but those are the only funds I was able to allocate. You'll have to make do with it. Besides, you may have other tasks soon.
AAD00104225	That's it?
AAD00104226	Wow, you're really mad.
AAD00104227	You better believe I'm mad. You've waged a one man campaign to drag our good name through the mud and I'll be held accountable!
AAD00104228	You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. Gah! This is what I get for hiring an idiot to do such an important job.
AAD00104229	Here, just take this and go. I have damage control to do.
AAD00104230	Wait, I'm supposed to send you to Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam, though why she wants to see an imbecile like you is beyond me.
AAD00104231	So go to Hoover Dam and see Colonel Moore. Got it? Hoover Dam. Colonel Moore. Maybe it's time to retire.
AAD00104232	I'm sorry. I screwed up.
AAD00104233	That's an understatement. Still, there's nothing to be done about it now. Maybe the violence will die down once things settle.
AAD00104234	Here, take this. It's not what I was planning to give you, but you deserve some sort of payment for your efforts. Oh, and one other thing.
AAD00104235	You wanted a man dead. He's dead. Now where are my caps?
AAD00104236	If it will get you out of my hair, this is a small price to pay. At least I won't have to put up with you any longer.
AAD00104237	When you put it that way... yes.
AAD00104238	Oh, I see. You're proud of your efforts, eh? Hmph! Thankfully, it looks like we won't be working together any longer.
AAD00104239	I'm not an assassin.
AAD00104240	In that case, we could take a different tack, but one that I at least have more experience with - diplomacy.
AAD00104241	If we can't go after the man responsible, we'll simply appeal to the man above him.
AAD00104242	The Kings, including our friend Pacer, report to the leader of their gang, a man who calls himself the King.
AAD00104243	
AAD00104244	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
AAD00104245	Maybe the Jet will cause his heart to give out.
AAD00104246	Sure, I'll look into it.
AAD00104247	Good. Our men have come up with two different plans for seeing an end to the violence.
AAD00104248	First, our sources have tracked most of the attacks back to a King named Pacer. The consensus is that the violence will stop if he's removed.
AAD00104249	The problem is we can't simply kill him. In the current climate, the NCR would likely be blamed for his death.
AAD00104250	There is an alternative option, but my sources feel that getting rid of this Pacer fellow is our best shot.
AAD00104251	
AAD00104252	Oh, I've already heard. Pacer is dead. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
AAD00104253	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
AAD00104254	What do you have to say for yourself?
AAD00104255	I've completed the Pacer job.
AAD00104256	Oh, I've already heard. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
AAD00104257	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
AAD00104258	What do you have to say for yourself?
AAD00104259	Uh, the King sort of got killed while I was working on that Freeside job.
AAD00104260	How is Heck a threat to other ranchers in The Wasteland?
AAD00104261	We are honest folk out there, damn hard to make the living in the desert, kid. Heck's a different breed, goddamn thief he is.
AAD00104262	Scaring us into giving away our lands is all he's done to strike it flush - comes packing iron and none can hold a candle to his men - bad blood.
AAD00104263	The best don't come cheap, Walter. 400 caps' my fee.
AAD00104264	[SUCCEEDED] All right, kid! I'm taking a liking to you. It's a deal.
AAD00104265	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what he's doing in town.
AAD00104266	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air over at that there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AAD00104267	I'll find out for you but not cheaply - 400 caps.
AAD00104268	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
AAD00104269	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what he's doing in town.
AAD00104270	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air over at that there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AAD00104271	I may be able to help you.
AAD00104272	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what he's doing in town.
AAD00104273	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air over at that there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
AAD00104274	What do you plan to do about him?
AAD00104275	Like I said, kid. Someone's got to rein in that greedy son of a gun.
AAD00104276	I have news about the Gundersons.
AAD00104277	I have questions about you.
AAD00104278	Okay. What'd you want to know?
AAD00104279	Then have, I don't know, some water or something.
AAD00104280	[FAILED] A drink? Nonsense. All I need now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
AAD00104281	You look more than just too hot - what's the matter?
AAD00104282	[SUCCEEDED] Sharp eyes on you, all right. We've gone through a heap of trouble to get in town. Ethel says I just need to wet my throat.
AAD00104283	A drink? Nonsense. All I need now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
AAD00104284	You worked in Gomorrah as a Croupier, uh? What was it like?
AAD00104285	Hey, you're smart. Okay, it was like finding diamonds in your vodka and showgirls under your card table. You want it, Gomorrah has it.
AAD00104286	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
AAD00104287	What are the important players in town?
AAD00104288	Ha! There's only one important player in town, and that's Mr. House. Everyone keeps clean around him, the Families, the barons - fuck, even the NCR.
AAD00104289	
AAD00104290	[FAILED] My momma didn't raise no quitter, and I stand by my beliefs. The answer is no.
AAD00104291	The NCR is far too powerful. Just give up.
AAD00104292	VMS21ClandenMurderRoom
AAD00104293	What the fuck are you trying to pull here? Where is my girl? Now I'm gonna have to kill your sorry ass.
AAD00104294	Okay, little lady, let's get started. You look like a tough piece of meat, I'm going to enjoy tenderizing you.
AAD00104295	I thought that maybe I could be your next playtoy. Your exploits are well known.
AAD00104296	Well, look at you! It's so rare I get a volunteer. Yeah, let's head to my special room. Follow me, we'll talk there.
AAD00104297	
AAD00104298	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, already? I figured it would be a couple days. Well, let's go meet the lucky lady.
AAD00104299	Oh, I was just told to deliver a girl to the spare room you keep up here.
AAD00104300	[FAILED] I don't care much about your tastes. Get lost and leave me alone.
AAD00104301	Well... I... I have some exotic tastes too!
AAD00104302	VMS21ClandenArrest
AAD00104303	Alright. I'll come quietly, but this is fucked.
AAD00104304	Never mind, I have some other questions though.
AAD00104305	Okay, ask away.
AAD00104306	I found a dead girl in Gomorrah.
AAD00104307	Well that's something, but I can't go in there without proof of foul play.
AAD00104308	I'd like to report a murder at Gomorrah.
AAD00104309	Murder? What kind of murder? Do you have any proof?
AAD00104310	No thanks, Mr. House.
AAD00104311	If you find Caesar's Legion so frightening at this remove, imagine them rampaging across the Strip.
AAD00104312	We have a chance to see them destroyed, to see New Vegas become the harbinger of a new age.
AAD00104313	I'm listening.
AAD00104314	You'll have to return to Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
AAD00104315	I'll be on my way, then...
AAD00104316	I must insist that you stay long enough for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
AAD00104317	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role. To get started, all you need do is take the elevator all the way down...
AAD00104318	I must insist that you stay long enough for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
AAD00104319	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role.
AAD00104320	To get started, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level...
AAD00104321	
AAD00104322	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
AAD00104323	It looks like you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to it.
AAD00104324	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
AAD00104325	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
AAD00104326	Maybe the Jet will cause his heart to give out.
AAD00104327	What would I need to do?
AAD00104328	Go and talk to the King, try to convince him to put an end to this violence. Pacer's a punk, but he won't likely disobey a direct order.
AAD00104329	The King might not be open to the idea at first, so you may have to integrate yourself with him. Do whatever it takes.
AAD00104330	When it's done, one way or the other, report back here and we'll take it from there.
AAD00104331	Tell me more about the King.
AAD00104332	He's caucasian, in his mid-30s, and extremely charismatic. It's that last part that we're counting on.
AAD00104333	The Kings are a bunch of young hoodlums who aren't inclined to listen to anyone, except him. Get him on your side, and the rest will fall in line.
AAD00104334	No catch. You just make sure no King attacks an NCR citizen from now on.
AAD00104335	I can't give you these tapes, they are evidence of a crime.
AAD00104336	I guess you've made your choice then. Time to die.
AAD00104337	
AAD00104338	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no fucking way I'm going anywhere if those tapes aren't with me.
AAD00104339	If you... um... give me 300 caps and leave Vegas, I'll keep these tapes safe.
AAD00104340	I could do that for you.
AAD00104341	Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us both.
AAD00104342	Quartermaster Mayes has been complaining to me nonstop about the lack of supplies, but unfortunately, we aren't getting a resupply any time soon.
AAD00104343	I want you to speak with him and see if there's anything you can do for him.
AAD00104344	What do you need help with?
AAD00104345	I'm short-staffed and I don't have the time to take care of some issues around the camp.
AAD00104346	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
AAD00104347	What's the trouble with the Legion?
AAD00104348	Hell, what ain't the trouble with the Legion? This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up.
AAD00104349	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
AAD00104350	James Garret is looking for a suave escort. Interested in some work?
AAD00104351	I'm honored they would consider me. I'll start immediately.
AAD00104352	I finished looking over your patients.
AAD00104353	Excellent job. Where'd you learn to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
AAD00104354	As for the men, they'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
AAD00104355	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Once again, you have my sincerest thanks.
AAD00104356	All I'm asking is that you try.
AAD00104357	I'll give it my best. You've earned that much. But that makes us even, you hear?
AAD00104358	I'd like to think about it.
AAD00104359	That's a good idea. I don't give out favors every day, so you probably shouldn't rush to pick something.
AAD00104360	Tumble it around in your mind and come back when you know what you want. I'll be here.
AAD00104361	You might like to know that Heck's barely protected, right now.
AAD00104362	So, Ted's nowhere to be found and Heck's quite unprotected while looking for him, huh?
AAD00104363	Hell, it sounds like the perfect time to get even. Heck won't know what hit him. What do you say?
AAD00104364	No.
AAD00104365	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, yes I do.
AAD00104366	Follow me.
AAD00104367	<Pay 10 caps>
AAD00104368	Don't get wise. We charge per use, so make that first drink worth the caps.
AAD00104369	No, not yet.
AAD00104370	Let me know when you find something out.
AAD00104371	The better question is, what are *you* going to do with it?
AAD00104372	The better question is, what are *you* going to do with it?
AAD00104373	How does 100 caps sound?
AAD00104374	I couldn't convince her to attempt a escape.
AAD00104375	That won't do... at all. Listen, it can't be the Jet, Cachino's got her scared shitless.
AAD00104376	Find a way to make this work... please.
AAD00104377	Joana's happy to hear from you and wants to escape Gomorrah.
AAD00104378	She is...? Listen, no time to waste. Help her get to Freeside. That's our ticket out of this fucking city.
AAD00104379	I'll meet you there between midnight and dawn, though we could use some backup. We only got one chance to get this right, you hear?
AAD00104380	These guys in Freeside, good shots, right? They owe me big time. Tell 'em that Carlitos's back to collect his chips. They'll know what do.
AAD00104381	
AAD00104382	Oh, a good ways west of here, in a place you've never been. Far as we're concerned, only name it ever had was "Phebus Ranch."
AAD00104383	That was before we lost some land to Heck Gunderson. The bank demanded payment in full the day after the Stockmen's Association bailed it out.
AAD00104384	
AAD00104385	A good life if you don't mind hard work. The only real fuss is the constant bother with varmints.
AAD00104386	Fail to catch Molerats early in their breeding, and you'll have three or four head breaking their ankles in Molerat holes every day.
AAD00104387	Of course, the worst varmint of all is a Brahmin Baron with his hands in the pockets of a Republic senator.
AAD00104388	That's a problem you can't solve with a Varmint Rifle, though I fear my husband's apt to try. He's got Heck Gunderson in his sights right now.
AAD00104389	I have news about the Gundersons.
AAD00104390	Why is Caesar's Legion so... strange?
AAD00104391	The bombs wiped the slate clean. Human civilization descended to a level of ignorance that effectively set our cultural progress back to zero.
AAD00104392	The NCR has all the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
AAD00104393	Just as with the ancient Republic, it is natural that a military force should conquer and transform the NCR into a military dictatorship.
AAD00104394	Thesis and antithesis. The Colorado River is my Rubicon. The NCR council will be eradicated, but the new synthesis will change the Legion as well...
AAD00104395	...from a basically nomadic army to a standing military force that protects its citizens, and the power of its dictator.
AAD00104396	So what's "dialectic" about you and the NCR?
AAD00104397	What do you think of the NCR?
AAD00104398	Do you want my opinion as a former citizen, or future conqueror? Actually, my opinion's the same either way.
AAD00104399	As a young man I was taught to venerate President Tandi of Shady Sands. "The Founding Mother of the New California Republic."
AAD00104400	Did you know her Presidency lasted 52 years? And that her father, Aradesh, was the Republic's first President?
AAD00104401	Does that sound like a democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
AAD00104402	How did you capture Benny?
AAD00104403	I'll hand it to that piece of shit, he was determined. He used some kind of Old-World stealth device to get across the river in a Legion boat.
AAD00104404	Seems the device ran out of juice once he got here, but he was dressed like a Legionary. He was caught just outside the weather station.
AAD00104405	See, thing is, he didn't change his hairstyle. To go to all that effort and fail because you're too vain to muss your hair...
AAD00104406	So, who are you?
AAD00104407	I've been around a while. Currently working for the Followers as a gun for hire, but it's getting rather dull.
AAD00104408	Aside from protecting them from the occasional thug looking to intercept supply shipments, there isn't much to do around here.
AAD00104409	The one researcher I liked who I could chat up about liquor got transferred, and the rest of the docs are pretty uptight about my kind of fun.
AAD00104410	I bet you've seen a lot over the years.
AAD00104411	I've been around long enough to observe the patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
AAD00104412	Sounds good to me. <Pay 25 caps.>
AAD00104413	Meet me upstairs. I'll try to leave you in one piece.
AAD00104414	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
AAD00104415	Santiago is here to please, my prairie flower. Just a few caps and I'm yours.
AAD00104416	Here you go. <Pay 25 caps>
AAD00104417	I'll meet you upstairs in a moment, darling.
AAD00104418	The Followers are looking to work out a supply deal.
AAD00104419	Are they looking to buy guns?
AAD00104420	The Followers are looking to set up a supply deal.
AAD00104421	We don't have the stills and equipment to supply the amount of meds they're looking to purchase.
AAD00104422	You could check with other wasteland merchants, but I think your best bet would be the Atomic Wrangler.
AAD00104423	They've got a bunch of stills and a seemingly endless supply of grain alcohol, which could be used as anesthetic or disinfectant.
AAD00104424	A regular shipment of supplies is what you need here.
AAD00104425	That would be a godsend, but so far we've had no luck working out a deal with the Crimson Caravan or any other local merchants.
AAD00104426	If you could manage to find someone willing to work with us, I'd gladly offer medical supplies at a discount.
AAD00104427	I have some medical supplies to drop off.
AAD00104428	Good to hear! What do you have to donate?
AAD00104429	Med-X.
AAD00104430	RadAway.
AAD00104431	We have a good stock of RadAway at this point, but every extra bit helps. How much do you have to donate?
AAD00104432	Fixer.
AAD00104433	The Garrets should be sending over supplies shortly.
AAD00104434	I'm honestly pleasantly surprised they would help us out, but I can see the Garrets aren't doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.
AAD00104435	Well, it looks like you've earned yourself a discount on supplies now that we'll be fully covered. This supply deal will aid our work immensely.
AAD00104436	Nothing, I'll find him for you.
AAD00104437	What? Are you... serious? Well, I'm not complaining, hon.
AAD00104438	Thanks so much for your help.
AAD00104439	What's happened to you?
AAD00104440	I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
AAD00104441	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
AAD00104442	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana, and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
AAD00104443	Joana, you can trust me. Why are you avoiding my questions?
AAD00104444	[SUCCEEDED] I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
AAD00104445	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
AAD00104446	I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana, and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
AAD00104447	I want to talk about Carlitos.
AAD00104448	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
AAD00104449	Yes?
AAD00104450	I'm busy now.
AAD00104451	Yeah, sure fucking thing. I'll be waiting with bated breath for your schedule to clear up, ha ha.
AAD00104452	
AAD00104453	You kept away the undesirables, patted down the rest for weapons, and kept your cool.
AAD00104454	That is to say, you performed as instructed. Simon was impressed, and so am I. So you get a small bonus with your normal pay.
AAD00104455	
AAD00104456	And? Don't leave me in suspense. What was their reaction?
AAD00104457	I delivered the package as requested.
AAD00104458	ChallengePlayer
AAD00104459	Imposter!
AAD00104460	When did you notice them missing?
AAD00104461	I remember coming in one morning and noticing my supplies were lower than they should have been.
AAD00104462	I thought it might have been a mistake, but another morning I noticed the same thing.
AAD00104463	The camp is pretty dead at night, especially at 0200 hours when the guard shift changes. That'd be a good place to start looking.
AAD00104464	It wasn't me.
AAD00104465	That's an odd response if I've ever heard one.
AAD00104466	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AAD00104467	Maybe you're just careless.
AAD00104468	I may have my hands full here, but I'm anything but careless.
AAD00104469	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AAD00104470	Perhaps you've misplaced them?
AAD00104471	Anything is possible, but that's unlikely.
AAD00104472	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
AAD00104473	What makes you think someone is stealing your supplies?
AAD00104474	The simple fact that I no longer have as many supplies as I should. I've been careful with them and I should have more than what remains.
AAD00104475	Unfortunately, I don't have time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
AAD00104476	It looks like you have a decent facility here.
AAD00104477	Someone with medical experience, I take it? It's not the best, but it does the job.
AAD00104478	I just wish I had the equipment and supplies to handle the number of injuries we have here.
AAD00104479	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
AAD00104480	Things look pretty rough in here.
AAD00104481	Men have waged war on each other for countless centuries. Now is no different.
AAD00104482	People fight and die for what they believe in. I'm just here to patch them up so they can go on their merry way. Do no harm and all that.
AAD00104483	This better be good.
AAD00104484	Have you looked around? Have you seen what's going on here? What we're going through?
AAD00104485	This place is hell. I've seen all my friends butchered by the Legion in front of my very eyes. I can still hear their screams at night.
AAD00104486	All I wanted was a little escape, so I took some drugs to help me do that. Is that so bad?
AAD00104487	Do you have the troops to retake Nelson?
AAD00104488	Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
AAD00104489	We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
AAD00104490	We've been reinforced fairly well, thanks to your help. I'd say the odds are in our favor.
AAD00104491	However, if you help out a little more around the camp, we'd be in a good enough position to send our best men to help retake Nelson.
AAD00104492	Thanks for your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
AAD00104493	I did what I could for your patients.
AAD00104494	Thanks for your help. I'll take it from here.
AAD00104495	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
AAD00104496	This sounds pretty dangerous.
AAD00104497	It's dangerous, but not as bad now that we've taken back Nelson from the Legion.
AAD00104498	Of course it's dangerous! Damn Legion raiding parties have been giving us hell ever since they took over Nelson.
AAD00104499	Hell, my men probably got ambushed by a raiding party! But we need those supplies, and we need them badly.
AAD00104500	Any idea on where I should start looking?
AAD00104501	I sent them to HELIOS One to see if they had any supplies they could spare. They've got to be somewhere between here and there.
AAD00104502	I'd try searching the main road, or checking with the men at HELIOS One to see if they know anything.
AAD00104503	I could use some patching up.
AAD00104504	If you were a trooper, I'd tell you to walk it off, but they're your caps.
AAD00104505	Yep, you appear to be pretty cut up, but nothing some stitches and pain pills won't cure.
AAD00104506	Do you have the caps to cover the pills and treatment?
AAD00104507	Hot damn you got whooped good! This could take a while.
AAD00104508	I will also require some caps to cover my supplies.
AAD00104509	I have radiation sickness.
AAD00104510	I can take care of that quick and easy, if you've got the caps.
AAD00104511	<Pay caps>
AAD00104512	Okay. A couple rounds of RadAway should do it.
AAD00104513	<Pay 100 caps>
AAD00104514	Okay. A couple rounds of RadAway should do it.
AAD00104515	<Pay 90 caps>
AAD00104516	Okay. A couple rounds of RadAway should do it.
AAD00104517	<Pay 80 caps>
AAD00104518	<Pay 100 caps>
AAD00104519	Hold still. The RadAway burns a little.
AAD00104520	<Pay 50 caps>
AAD00104521	Hold still. The RadAway burns a little.
AAD00104522	TopsHadrianPerformanceStrings
AAD00104523	I tell ya, you've got great eyes. You could spot a Super Mutant at three paces.
AAD00104524	My friend, you've got style, grace, and charm - the style of a feral Ghoul, the grace of a Super Mutant, and the charm of a Deathclaw.
AAD00104525	And talk about your quick reflexes, this gal is so fast she beat me to the punchline.
AAD00104526	TopsBillyKnightPerformanceStrings
AAD00104527	It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail, ho.
AAD00104528	It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out. What?
AAD00104529	They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number! What?
AAD00104530	Hey, what about that suit Benny wears? If I had a suit like that, the ladies would be all over me. What, you expect a punchline? The guy pays my salary, it's true!
AAD00104531	I told my wife, she's good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul, ay ay ay.
AAD00104532	I love these robots with their friendly little policeman faces. Sure, they still rough you up, but they look so happy!
AAD00104533	My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous, ha cha cha.
AAD00104534	I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next to a brothel, oh no.
AAD00104535	I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest. Oh no!
AAD00104536	I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong? Ohh.
AAD00104537	I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me! No!
AAD00104538	I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back. I did it!
AAD00104539	I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood. Ay ay ay.
AAD00104540	People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - hey, how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark! And it burns.
AAD00104541	So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole. Did he just say that?
AAD00104542	I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown. I ate a person!
AAD00104543	A ghoul goes to a doctor and says, "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says, "Son, that's called your face." Ding dong!
AAD00104544	Judging from the economic state of Freeside, they can't be paying you that much.
AAD00104545	Okay, I admit it, I ain't exactly rolling in caps here, but whaddya want? I'm under contract, I can't get out.
AAD00104546	I'll do it.
AAD00104547	Find her, bring her back here so we can talk. Needless to say, there's some good money in it for you.
AAD00104548	Who is this girl?
AAD00104549	Her name is Rose of Sharon Cassidy. That's some fancy shit, right? Don't know what her mother was thinking with a name like that.
AAD00104550	But this girl and I, we need to have a discussion. Find her, bring her here, so I can talk to her, one-on-one.
AAD00104551	Carlitos is ready to cash in his chips.
AAD00104552	So you said. All Little Beard and me need to know is when and where.
AAD00104553	<Hushed> Would my companion here make a suitable replacement meal?
AAD00104554	Hmm. He's a little thin, but he looks like he comes from good stock with that strong jaw and upright posture.
AAD00104555	From the smell of her I'd say we can skip the whiskey marinade. But other than her liver she seems to be in working order.
AAD00104556	What about the boy you kidnapped?
AAD00104557	Ted Gunderson is his name. It would be simplest if we could convince him this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
AAD00104558	But if he won't listen, we can't very well let him go. He'll have to be slaughtered and served. Then we wouldn't need the replacement.
AAD00104559	But you would need to deal with his father, Heck. Perhaps if you could smear some of Ted's blood around his father's hotel room, you could frame him.
AAD00104560	I think you have the wrong person for this job.
AAD00104561	Perhaps I do. Forget I mentioned it.
AAD00104562	Do you have any work that needs to be done?
AAD00104563	Yes, I'm glad you asked. I've heard about you, you know. You strike me as just the sort of person who can help me.
AAD00104564	I'm in a bind. I've been planning an exquisite Society dinner, but there's a bit of a problem with the main course.
AAD00104565	He's got a powerful and temperamental father.
AAD00104566	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
AAD00104567	The Tops casino, my friend! If you're in the mood to knock back a few and frolic the night away, ain't no better place on Earth!
AAD00104568	Who is the Lonesome Drifter?
AAD00104569	Way I hear it, he's some whack job who used to spend his nights sitting around a campfire and howling to himself.
AAD00104570	"Who wants to hear songs that make you wanna cry?" I try to tell them. But hey, they don't pay me to ask questions.
AAD00104571	Do me a favor - go see the show. Otherwise they'll think I didn't do my job.
AAD00104572	A velvety-voiced cool cat fresh out of New Reno, that's who! When Bruce sings, his smokey, dulcet tones will transport you to another world!
AAD00104573	Who's Bruce Isaac?
AAD00104574	What sort of show are you talking about?
AAD00104575	Hadrian, the insult comic! "Did I stutter, fucktard?"
AAD00104576	See, I'm using insults to promote the act. That was my idea!
AAD00104577	Let's do this.
AAD00104578	We don't have many troops, so we can only attack from one direction. Where should we focus the attack?
AAD00104579	Let's talk about something else.
AAD00104580	What did you want to know?
AAD00104581	What's all the fuss about the water pump?
AAD00104582	Bill Ronte installed that pump a few years ago, back when he was sober. It was a major improvement for the community.
AAD00104583	But lately, The Kings have started charging locals to use it - and NCR squatters twice as much. That'll come to no good.
AAD00104584	Santiago's your man.
AAD00104585	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104586	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AAD00104587	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AAD00104588	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104589	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AAD00104590	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104591	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
AAD00104592	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104593	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AAD00104594	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104595	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AAD00104596	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104597	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
AAD00104598	
AAD00104599	[SUCCEEDED] Are you shitting me? You didn't even know what the plan was? Yeah, as a last request I guess we can give you that courtesy.
AAD00104600	As a last request, will you tell me more about your plan?
AAD00104601	[FAILED] Sorry, but you're going to have to die ignorant.
AAD00104602	Err... can you tell me what the plan was?
AAD00104603	Couldn't Heck just claim intruders killed his son?
AAD00104604	No. Everyone he meets, he tells the same story. That his son disappeared from the casino, not from his room. He'll look guilty.
AAD00104605	I'll try, but not for free.
AAD00104606	Okay, you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
AAD00104607	What do you need artillery for?
AAD00104608	The best marksmen of the NCR are usually at the rear of any battle. The gun will allow us to strike at them.
AAD00104609	How do things look around the camp?
AAD00104610	Things are looking good. With the new resources and support, morale is at the highest it's ever been around here.
AAD00104611	When the Legion assaults the dam, the Brotherhood will attack the NCR and weaken them.
AAD00104612	Not surprising. Also not acceptable.
AAD00104613	I didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill them. This was a waste of time.
AAD00104614	Go back to the bunker and destroy it. My directions have been clear from the start.
AAD00104615	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
AAD00104616	I'll be near the entrance, but I need to keep out of sight. The Omertas have contacts, and they're still looking for me.
AAD00104617	<Lie and give 600 caps> I collected all of the debts.
AAD00104618	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AAD00104619	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AAD00104620	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AAD00104621	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00104622	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00104623	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00104624	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
AAD00104625	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
AAD00104626	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
AAD00104627	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
AAD00104628	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
AAD00104629	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
AAD00104630	How's the morale doing?
AAD00104631	Lower than a Feral Ghoul's IQ.
AAD00104632	Make it a 1000 caps. That's enough to betray the Omertas, no?
AAD00104633	[FAILED] Do you think us inferior men, willing to sell their souls for scraps! Enough of this.
AAD00104634	Time to die!
AAD00104635	I need some injuries patched up.
AAD00104636	Okay, what level of care do you require?
AAD00104637	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
AAD00104638	Are they back?
AAD00104639	I can get that out for you. <Apply Sleeper Hold>
AAD00104640	Oh, that feels nice. I can already feel myself rela...
AAD00104641	Why would I want a piece of shit machete?
AAD00104642	That blade has split the heads of... The only reason I give it to you is to force myself to earn another. True to Caesar.
AAD00104643	I was in the area, that's all.
AAD00104644	Not all of us have the luxury of coming and going as we please. Here, we stay put.
AAD00104645	What's the situation here?
AAD00104646	My orders are to hold Nelson. So far, the enemy north of here has been too frightened to move against us. Why should it concern you?
AAD00104647	Was there something you needed me to do?
AAD00104648	There is a gambler, Martina Groesbeck, who has a knack for learning other people's secrets and passing that information along, for a price.
AAD00104649	The Omertas, who run Gomorrah, have become suspicious of Martina's frequent visits to their casino. Soon they'll pay her a visit of their own.
AAD00104650	I'd like to trade.
AAD00104651	I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
AAD00104652	I don't have any supplies to spare for someone with your spotted reputation, but buy your stuff for half the going rate.
AAD00104653	Do it.
AAD00104654	Okay, this might hurt a bit...
AAD00104655	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
AAD00104656	Can you heal my radiation?
AAD00104657	Sure can. The sooner the better if you ask me, unless you want a third arm.
AAD00104658	I have wounds that need mending.
AAD00104659	I've seen worse, but I should be able to fix you up pretty easily.
AAD00104660	Yeah, that looks pretty nasty.
AAD00104661	This might take a miracle, and a lot of money.
AAD00104662	I need medical treatment.
AAD00104663	I don't have that many supplies left, so I can't offer my services freely, but I can help you.
AAD00104664	Heal me up completely.
AAD00104665	Stitching up lacerations and treating wounds will take some time. I'm going to need caps to get started.
AAD00104666	I've got some wounds I need you to look at.
AAD00104667	Did a Super Mutant use your torso as a punching bag or something? I'm going to need more gauze...
AAD00104668	Okay. This shouldn't take long, but I'm going to need some caps to cover supplies.
AAD00104669	They said the man was severely beaten and barely survived.
AAD00104670	Huh, that would explain why they're all riled at us. Seems like we have a big misunderst- what the hell?
AAD00104671	Do you know anything about NCR soldiers here in Freeside?
AAD00104672	
AAD00104673	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here's some more, but you better keep your mouth shut! I'm out of here. Got some important business to take care of.
AAD00104674	That's a good start...
AAD00104675	[FAILED] That's all you get. Keep your mouth shut. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
AAD00104676	That's it?
AAD00104677	Do you serve food to Locals as well?
AAD00104678	No, I'm afraid we don't. Don't you have a friend you wanted to bring in?
AAD00104679	It seemed fairly innocent.
AAD00104680	Nothing's innocent in Freeside. You should know that by now.
AAD00104681	No, I'm guessing they're doing something they know will cause a row, like keeping the food all to themselves.
AAD00104682	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
AAD00104683	Stop bugging me.
AAD00104684	Hey, just doing my job, okay? Jeesh.
AAD00104685	It's not like you'd be a slave. You'd get to choose your clients.
AAD00104686	What's the difference?! Once you start working for the man, you gotta buy nice things to wear.
AAD00104687	Then, you gotta make more money to afford nice things. Seems like a right vicious cycle to get into.
AAD00104688	This would be as an "escort."
AAD00104689	Eh. I've escorted my share of idiot tourists around Freeside. Too much trouble for what it pays.
AAD00104690	What do you know about the Van Graffs?
AAD00104691	A couple of Radscorpions, those two. Gloria is the stable one, but she'd slit your throat if there's a profit in it.
AAD00104692	Or rather she'd tell her brother to do it for her. Jean-Baptiste is one of the sicker humans I've had the displeasure of observing.
AAD00104693	What's your opinion of Mr. House?
AAD00104694	Before or after the human race shot itself in the foot? I've been around long enough to have both opinions, see.
AAD00104695	Before the war, Mr. House was a famous captain of industry - robotics, to be specific. Seemed charming in interviews, until he became a recluse.
AAD00104696	Since the war, though? Didn't make a peep for near two hundred years - but when he came back, he came back strong and killed a lot of people.
AAD00104697	What do you think of the NCR?
AAD00104698	I reckon they care about getting water and electricity from the dam, and that's where it ends.
AAD00104699	The locals here are just an inconvenience to 'em, something to step over or stomp down. They're here for the resources, plain and simple.
AAD00104700	Just that Jean-Baptiste has Pacer's Jet.
AAD00104701	I was thinking of raiding his Jet stash.
AAD00104702	Ha, he's a Jet junkie? He'll go crazy when he finds it gone. I like it.
AAD00104703	I'll tell you what. When you hit the stash, leave this note from me. If the punk really has it bad, he'll come running straight here.
AAD00104704	His gang won't be able to say shit if he comes storming this place himself.
AAD00104705	Yep, let's rock.
AAD00104706	All right, this is going to be fun.
AAD00104707	VMS18SecuritronArrestHeck
AAD00104708	The hell I will.
AAD00104709	What do you know about Hoover Dam?
AAD00104710	Quite a bit actually. I was stationed there nearby during the first battle of Hoover Dam four years ago. I saw a lot of what happened firsthand.
AAD00104711	Who are you?
AAD00104712	I haven't the time to speak to commoners such as yourself.
AAD00104713	Count me out.
AAD00104714	That's a shame. Well, if you change your mind, let me know. Need anything else?
AAD00104715	I found all the evidence you'll need from Saint James' and Dermot's rooms. Here.
AAD00104716	Let's see... a bear. Yes, this belonged to the little girl, so that's a direct connection to the missing people.
AAD00104717	And this ledger - I know these names. Nephi and Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
AAD00104718	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
AAD00104719	I'll take a look and see if there's anything I can do.
AAD00104720	That's already more than I was expecting. I'll keep watch to make sure no more Legion come up the road. Good luck.
AAD00104721	VHDKimballSpeech01
AAD00104722	Thank you, my fellow Californians, who have come so far to answer the call to service put forth by the republic.
AAD00104723	There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting? What is Nevada to us?"
AAD00104724	Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell are you waiting for? You think I want to get shot? Let's go!
AAD00104725	You must've been at Bitter Springs. What happened there?
AAD00104726	That part of my life's over now. And so is this discussion.
AAD00104727	Better for her to die than live as a Legion slave.
AAD00104728	Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death.
AAD00104729	There was no choice in what I did. It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
AAD00104730	What'll happen at the Fort?
AAD00104731	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AAD00104732	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. That it would be a woman is even more surprising.
AAD00104733	What is this place?
AAD00104734	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
AAD00104735	Are things going better at the camp now?
AAD00104736	Captain Gilles said to talk to you about medical aid for the camp.
AAD00104737	Hey, if you can help, I'll take whatever I can get. Doctor's Bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
AAD00104738	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
AAD00104739	What I really need are medical texts - books on psychology or pediatrics, specifically.
AAD00104740	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AAD00104741	What I really need is a book on psychology. Something for post-traumatic stress.
AAD00104742	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AAD00104743	What I really need is a book on pediatric medicine. We've got a lot of sick and injured kids here.
AAD00104744	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
AAD00104745	Doctor's bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
AAD00104746	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
AAD00104747	What kind of aid were you looking for again?
AAD00104748	I found one of those books you wanted.
AAD00104749	Both of them? Wow, that's very resourceful. Thank you.
AAD00104750	I found those books you wanted.
AAD00104751	That's great! Thank you. I'm sure this will go a long way toward making things better here.
AAD00104752	This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you.
AAD00104753	I found another book for you.
AAD00104754	My friend here is a doctor, maybe he could give you some training in those areas instead.
AAD00104755	Yeah? Hey, sure, that would be fantastic!
AAD00104756	I'll keep my eyes open for books on pediatrics or psychological trauma, then.
AAD00104757	Thank you. Any help you can give would be a godsend.
AAD00104758	Medical texts? Aren't you a doctor?
AAD00104759	I'm an Army field medic. I can treat bullet wounds, shrapnel, trench foot, no problem.
AAD00104760	But this - the kids and the psychological trauma and all the rest - is out of my league.
AAD00104761	I found this supply cache in a cave up the mountain. Maybe it will help.
AAD00104762	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. This will be a tremendous help.
AAD00104763	I found these supply caches in some caves up the mountain. Maybe they'll help.
AAD00104764	Firearms.
AAD00104765	Firearms of what kind?
AAD00104766	Armor.
AAD00104767	What sort of armor?
AAD00104768	Do you think about Bitter Springs a lot?
AAD00104769	Yeah. Always. Even when I sleep.
AAD00104770	Why are you still here?
AAD00104771	I don't know, I just love it here. What the fuck do you think, asshole?
AAD00104772	Prize for second place was I got to live, but they beat my fucking legs with hammers. I'm fucking crippled, get it?
AAD00104773	How did you survive?
AAD00104774	Luck, that's how! I'm just that fucking lucky!
AAD00104775	You're looking at the second place winner of the Nipton lottery! That asshole Swanick took first place, so him they let walk!
AAD00104776	What happened to this town?
AAD00104777	The Legion happened. What the fuck's it look like?
AAD00104778	What sort of lottery did you win?
AAD00104779	What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
AAD00104780	Only lottery that matters! Oh my God, smell that air!
AAD00104781	Are you feeling all right?
AAD00104782	Are you kidding me? Never felt better! Yeah!
AAD00104783	Captain Gilles at Bitter Springs needs reinforcements. Can you spare any?
AAD00104784	After what you did getting my Misfits whipped into shape? Yeah, I can spare a couple of boys for Bitter Springs. I'll issue the dispatch orders.
AAD00104785	We can stay on Coyote Tail Ridge for the night.
AAD00104786	Let's go up there first, huh?
AAD00104787	We can do that.
AAD00104788	All right. We won't stay for long.
AAD00104789	What are the rules?
AAD00104790	The rules are simple. My creatures fight for our pleasure. You can bet on a contender and earn double if you choose the victor.
AAD00104791	But you can get a bigger share if you risk your skin in The Thorn. Win a fight and I'll give you a meaty cut of the earnings.
AAD00104792	I won't tolerate anyone that interferes with the fights. Offend me, and your blood will be the next to spill. Other than that, anything goes.
AAD00104793	I've got other questions for you.
AAD00104794	I'm listening.
AAD00104795	I want to fight in The Thorn.
AAD00104796	I'll fight Geckos.
AAD00104797	Be warned, my Geckos are the toughest you'll ever face.
AAD00104798	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104799	I'll fight Cazadores.
AAD00104800	My deadly Cazadores will test your limits.
AAD00104801	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104802	I'll fight Radscorpions.
AAD00104803	Let's see what you've got.
AAD00104804	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104805	I'll fight Giant Mantises.
AAD00104806	Let's test your mettle.
AAD00104807	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104808	How do you train the creatures?
AAD00104809	Even if I trusted you, I'd not share my secrets just for your pretty face, stranger.
AAD00104810	The Thorn's a sacred ground, a source of awe. Here we truly rule over the forces of nature, for once.
AAD00104811	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's a good enough answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
AAD00104812	What's fighting in the next match?
AAD00104813	Deadly Night Stalkers will now fight for our pleasure.
AAD00104814	10 mm Submachine Gun [30 tags].
AAD00104815	Take it.
AAD00104816	Reinforced Leather Armor [20 tags].
AAD00104817	This is your size.
AAD00104818	Leather Armor [15 tags].
AAD00104819	This is your size.
AAD00104820	Laser Rifle [50 tags].
AAD00104821	Take it.
AAD00104822	Laser Pistol [25 tags].
AAD00104823	Take it.
AAD00104824	9 mm Submachine Gun [20 tags].
AAD00104825	Take it.
AAD00104826	Grenades [3 tags].
AAD00104827	Watch yourself with this.
AAD00104828	Dynamite [3 tags].
AAD00104829	Watch yourself with this.
AAD00104830	I can handle them, no problem.
AAD00104831	Okay, be careful out there.
AAD00104832	What can I do to help?
AAD00104833	Hmm.
AAD00104834	I think that you should be able to divert the flow of the water into the generator turbines. That would grind them up like a hamburger.
AAD00104835	The computer to activate it is just ahead, but you may need to go outside to activate the manual override. That system hasn't been used in a while.
AAD00104836	You have a deal.
AAD00104837	Thank you. I won't make any trouble when they come for me.
AAD00104838	Hector told me everything.
AAD00104839	I suppose there's no point in denying it any longer. I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
AAD00104840	We don't have money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
AAD00104841	Tell me about the co-op.
AAD00104842	The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share the profits of the co-op.
AAD00104843	Do you know how he got away from the NCR?
AAD00104844	Turns out some of them "Night Kids" - whatever you call those sneaky Super Mutant types - got in and busted him out.
AAD00104845	I guess somebody named "Tabitha" led the bunch that freed him. Don't know much more than that.
AAD00104846	Do you know anything about that Super Mutant walking around town?
AAD00104847	What's so great about the co-op?
AAD00104848	Food from the people and for the people. Anyone can buy, but the profits are shared by the folks who make the produce.
AAD00104849	Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Etienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
AAD00104850	Anyway, we don't gotta rely on merchants so much. And it means the troopers can use all the food they make over on the east side. Works out nice.
AAD00104851	Can you tell me about Westside?
AAD00104852	Well, things aren't great here, but I've seen a lot worse. We've got the Fiends to the south of us, and that ain't good.
AAD00104853	The Scorpions hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends.
AAD00104854	Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Etienne. Gets some help from the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
AAD00104855	< Blink. >
AAD00104856	Ugh. I figured you were a bit slow, but I never thought that - forget it, it's done.
AAD00104857	We girls have to stick together. Any chance you could give me a better deal?
AAD00104858	Yeah, you're right. For you, and just you, fifty caps. Don't tell anyone.
AAD00104859	< Speech 35 >
AAD00104860	[SUCCEEDED] Well... no I guess not. Okay - you show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
AAD00104861	I wouldn't offer if it wasn't safe. Do I look like someone who would hurt you?
AAD00104862	<SPEECH - player tells CR the daughter has an incurable STD>
AAD00104863	[FAILED] I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
AAD00104864	But the girl is sick. With classic symptoms of, uh... Vagina Dentata?
AAD00104865	I've paid for the three of you. You are free to go.
AAD00104866	Th-thank you! I don't think we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day, once I've found a place to settle.
AAD00104867	I got Sergeant Teddy - he's a little chewed up.
AAD00104868	That's okay, I'll fix him! Can I have him now?
AAD00104869	Goodbye.
AAD00104870	Here's 100 caps.
AAD00104871	I want to choose the contenders again.
AAD00104872	Cazador on Red.
AAD00104873	How many?
AAD00104874	I'll fight Night Stalkers.
AAD00104875	Prepare yourself, these Night Stalkers are hungry for blood.
AAD00104876	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104877	I'll fight Giant Radscorpions.
AAD00104878	Giant Radscorpions make deadly opponents.
AAD00104879	How many can you take on, stranger?
AAD00104880	About the effectiveness of your healing powders...
AAD00104881	What about it? Do you have some advice?
AAD00104882	< Survival 20 >
AAD00104883	[SUCCEEDED] Oh - I've been using two roots per flower. Thanks to you, I'll be able to create twice as much healing powder per day.
AAD00104884	You are using one Broc Flower per Xander Root, right?
AAD00104885	You're a doctor?
AAD00104886	I never finished my training - the Legion saw to that when they overran my town.
AAD00104887	I do know basic first aid, but I've had to rely on tribal remedies to treat illnesses and injuries - healing powders and all that.
AAD00104888	I'm always running low on Xander Root. Plenty of Broc Flowers, though.
AAD00104889	Let's do this.
AAD00104890	Good luck - you'll need it.
AAD00104891	Here's 100 caps.
AAD00104892	Here's 100 caps.
AAD00104893	Nice dog.
AAD00104894	Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl? Yeah!
AAD00104895	The Omertas were up to something big, but I stopped them.
AAD00104896	But we have other problems. While investigating the Omertas, what little I could on my end, I came across something much more sinister.
AAD00104897	Evidence suggests that Mr. House is planning to make some kind of move when the battle breaks out, and I'm guessing he won't be coming to our rescue.
AAD00104898	While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to take no risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
AAD00104899	The Khans won't be a problem to anyone ever again.
AAD00104900	Good riddance. We've had reports for years that they're the ones who supply the Fiends with chems, but no one's done anything about it.
AAD00104901	In any event, no one will miss them. And I've got another mission for you.
AAD00104902	I'm working on it.
AAD00104903	Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionary's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
AAD00104904	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
AAD00104905	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, you did it! Nice work!
AAD00104906	RF detonator? Give me a second. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
AAD00104907	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
AAD00104908	[SUCCEEDED] You did it! Thank you so much!
AAD00104909	[FAILED] Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. It's obvious you don't know what you're doing!
AAD00104910	So what's next for you?
AAD00104911	I'm getting ready to run a caravan up towards Utah. There's a town called New Canaan which is supposed to be pretty prosperous.
AAD00104912	The Crimson Caravan doesn't have any branches out that way, so it'll be up to me to get things started.
AAD00104913	Who's in charge here?
AAD00104914	Alice McLafferty runs the Crimson Caravan. You can find her over in the main office.
AAD00104915	I'm ready.
AAD00104916	Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
AAD00104917	I'm ready.
AAD00104918	Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
AAD00104919	Got it. I'm ready.
AAD00104920	Good luck.
AAD00104921	Who does the fighting?
AAD00104922	Most of the time it's some young Legionary trying to make a name for himself, hoping to get noticed by Caesar or the Praetorians.
AAD00104923	We pit slaves or prisoners against each other once in a while, but it's not much of a show. They're usually too reluctant to kill each other.
AAD00104924	Any idea where I might find those books?
AAD00104925	Caravan companies are probably your best bet. Smaller traders aren't likely to have anything that esoteric.
AAD00104926	I got them out alive.
AAD00104927	I was worried Alexus had already thrown them down a mineshaft. I'll run by camp to see how they're doing when I get a chance. Thanks for the help.
AAD00104928	Get over it. It's war. People die. Why should it matter whether they're soldiers or civilians?
AAD00104929	With the Khans, the only difference between a soldier and a civilian is that the civilian is more likely to miss when he shoots at you.
AAD00104930	Maybe Bitter Springs just seemed different. Maybe it's the same as killing legionaries.
AAD00104931	They'd have died whether or not they were soldiers. Whether or not I was there. And my leaving the NCR hasn't stopped any wars or saved any lives.
AAD00104932	There's no controlling war. No sense regretting what you can't stop.
AAD00104933	I wasn't going to let you die.
AAD00104934	I don't mean disrespect. It's a hell of a thing having someone with your ability looking out for me.
AAD00104935	But I've come to believe there are things nobody can stop. I thought for sure that's what we'd finally come up against today.
AAD00104936	It would've made sense for things to end here. But now... I'm still waiting.
AAD00104937	Where can I find Deathclaw Eggs?
AAD00104938	Quarry Junction is overrun with Deathclaws, but you may stand a better chance at a nest near the REPCONN Test Site.
AAD00104939	A 1000 caps will do. Take the eggs.
AAD00104940	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AAD00104941	700 caps will do. Take the eggs.
AAD00104942	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AAD00104943	<Placeholder Node for Successful Quest Returns>
AAD00104944	Do you have good news for The Thorn?
AAD00104945	500 caps sound good. Take the eggs.
AAD00104946	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AAD00104947	Where can I find Night Stalker Eggs?
AAD00104948	Night Stalkers are amongst the most fearsome beasts you'll ever face. They're also hard to find, but I know of a nest at a cave near Bitter Springs.
AAD00104949	300 caps are enough. Take the eggs.
AAD00104950	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
AAD00104951	I was planning on helping you get even deadlier creatures, but not without a raise.
AAD00104952	<Questions about VMS38 quest>
AAD00104953	Bring me a dozen Radscorpion eggs. I'll see to it that you're rewarded fairly.
AAD00104954	Bring me a dozen Fire Gecko eggs. This great challenge will earn you a matching reward.
AAD00104955	The Thorn's calling its elite hunters to collect one of its deadliest creatures. Find Night Stalker eggs and your bravery will be greatly rewarded.
AAD00104956	I'm asking our top hunters to gather Cazador eggs. I'd be impressed by whoever returns with such a prize.
AAD00104957	This is it, hunter. I've decided to grant you the opportunity to earn the greatest honor The Thorn could ever expect.
AAD00104958	Deathclaws are our most precious and our most feared contenders. I want you to be the one to deliver the sacred eggs to me, personally.
AAD00104959	How do you find these creatures?
AAD00104960	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of serving The Thorn.
AAD00104961	How could I help The Thorn?
AAD00104962	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
AAD00104963	There are a lot of tents here.
AAD00104964	And just about every one of them is occupied. Not all at the same time, usually - groups of Legionaries come and go all the time.
AAD00104965	This is also only one camp of many. You might have noticed the other camps down by the river.
AAD00104966	So why'd you leave?
AAD00104967	Ah, well... I just felt like it was time, you know? Wanted to have a home.
AAD00104968	Plus I was up at Camp Golf when Bitter Springs went down. I faked like I was sick to get out of going, because I knew some of the people there.
AAD00104969	But when everybody came back, nobody would tell me what happened. And people would call us murderers sometimes when we showed up to secure towns.
AAD00104970	I've dealt with the attacks on the camp. They won't be a problem any more.
AAD00104971	You did? Who was it? Any information you could give me would be a big help for my reports.
AAD00104972	The Khans settled in Red Rock Canyon years ago. It's time to let go of your hate and join them.
AAD00104973	Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe three years is vengeance enough. Thank you for helping me see that.
AAD00104974	Here. This will unlock the supply caches we left in caves around these mountains. You might get some use out of them.
AAD00104975	I'm looking for a howitzer firing mechanism.
AAD00104976	You may find one in the workshop. You're a friend to the tribe, so I trust it will not find its way into the wrong hands.
AAD00104977	Legion's attacked Nipton, burned and killed everyone.
AAD00104978	What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They... they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
AAD00104979	...we'll never stop them, not at this rate. We're doomed. Thanks for bringing the word - even if the news is bad, I'll let the men know.
AAD00104980	Okay, I'll see what I can do.
AAD00104981	Thanks. Anything else?
AAD00104982	LtMarklandNullLink
AAD00104983	Doctor's Bags would be a huge help too.
AAD00104984	Ten.
AAD00104985	Here, this is edible.
AAD00104986	Five.
AAD00104987	Here, this is edible.
AAD00104988	Three.
AAD00104989	Here, this is edible.
AAD00104990	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
AAD00104991	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the Legion or Frank.
AAD00104992	Do you have any "captures" with the last name, "Weathers?"
AAD00104993	Captures lose any claim to the names they called themselves when they let themselves be taken.
AAD00104994	If they're fortunate enough to become slaves, a new name will be given to them - one they can be proud of.
AAD00104995	<Give Mrs. Weathers the key from Canyon Runner>
AAD00104996	Th-thank you! I don't think we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day, once I've found a place to settle.
AAD00104997	How much would it cost to buy the three "captures"?
AAD00104998	It's a weak bunch, to be honest. I'd rather have extra currency to buy supplies or better captures off traders.
AAD00104999	There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they would have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
AAD00105000	The old woman's dried up, but she could keep house or do gardening - if she can learn to keep her mouth shut.
AAD00105001	The girl's the only one of real value, young enough to breed, not hideous to look at. What's your offer for the lot?
AAD00105002	So, you're a spy.
AAD00105003	No! Well, not really. I mean, I'm not listening through doors or sneaking around or anything. People talk out loud, and I just pay attention.
AAD00105004	The NCR likes to keep tabs on the activities of the Families, and they pay me good caps to hang around the casinos and keep my ears open.
AAD00105005	<Speech for allowing meds>
AAD00105006	[FAILED] Thus is Caesar's will. Do not test my patience.
AAD00105007	But medical chems aren't addictive! Really!
AAD00105008	Some spare meds would be great - and those books weren't cheap.
AAD00105009	Oh! Right, of course, I can give you a few spare meds and a few caps. Here.
AAD00105010	Who are you?
AAD00105011	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
AAD00105012	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
AAD00105013	Tell me about Caesar.
AAD00105014	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AAD00105015	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
AAD00105016	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
AAD00105017	Who is this Legatus you mention?
AAD00105018	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
AAD00105019	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
AAD00105020	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
AAD00105021	His latest campaign in the wilds of Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
AAD00105022	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
AAD00105023	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of them, in due time.
AAD00105024	Now go, and teach them what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AAD00105025	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
AAD00105026	Legionaries?! We have a problem!
AAD00105027	How can I serve the Legion?
AAD00105028	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
AAD00105029	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
AAD00105030	You said some of the people were enslaved?
AAD00105031	Yeah, a bunch of those Legion fucks dragged them off right away. They were headed East, if you're feeling heroic.
AAD00105032	How'd your plan go wrong?
AAD00105033	We get in position and next thing we know, we're surrounded by those fucking Legion freaks.
AAD00105034	They dragged us and everybody else into the center of town. And that asshole with a dog on his head, he starts talking about how we're bad people!
AAD00105035	He said we needed to be punished for what we did, not all of us, but some of us. And then he gives everyone a fucking lottery ticket...
AAD00105036	Hey, thanks, Frank. Go to hell.
AAD00105037	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
AAD00105038	Very well. You may proceed.
AAD00105039	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
AAD00105040	What's the best way for me to use your skills?
AAD00105041	Give me a rifle and a clear line of sight, and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
AAD00105042	Didn't have much hand-to-hand training, so our chances are better if you keep the enemy out of my face.
AAD00105043	I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I could find your targets for you.
AAD00105044	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
AAD00105045	So, I'm supposed to just start giving in to the demands of random strangers that come in here, huh? I don't think so.
AAD00105046	You want something from me, you're gonna have to earn it. And it just so happens that I've got a few things I need taken care of. So what do you say?
AAD00105047	I'd love to help you, but it seems I can't even prevent my own friends from getting killed. I'm sorry as can be, but I can't help you.
AAD00105048	I found a Legion sniper on the roof of the tower.
AAD00105049	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
AAD00105050	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
AAD00105051	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
AAD00105052	Something's wrong with my cyber-dog. I was told to come to you.
AAD00105053	It's neural degradation. Bio med gel can only preserve a living brain for so long, so you'll need to find a replacement.
AAD00105054	I haven't left Jacobstown in years, but there was one woman in Novac... Gibson? I remember her living with a pack of hounds.
AAD00105055	Aside from her, I know that the Fiends and Caesar's Legion fight alongside dogs. There could be viable specimens among them, if you can get to them.
AAD00105056	I don't see him with you. Bring him to me and I'll take a look. Otherwise, I'll just be guessing.
AAD00105057	<Speech Options>
AAD00105058	You are in charge of this operation. That sounds like a suicide mission, but our orders are to take commands from you.
AAD00105059	Unit, let's move out!
AAD00105060	You have superior firepower. You can overwhelm them if you push the advance on them.
AAD00105061	I'd like to know about you.
AAD00105062	Was part of a Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
AAD00105063	You can't really enjoy living here. Take 50 caps and get out of here.
AAD00105064	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week shaking down these assholes anyways.
AAD00105065	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
AAD00105066	You look capable of defending yourself.
AAD00105067	NCR whores?
AAD00105068	You heard me. We don't like those stiff-back, clean-hand little pussies. New Vegas belongs to the people.
AAD00105069	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
AAD00105070	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
AAD00105071	Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her around here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
AAD00105072	You look capable of defending yourself.
AAD00105073	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a sharp eye on you. I take it you like guns, huh? Question is, can you handle more than just a weapon...
AAD00105074	I see you can take care of yourself. Your revolver's trigger shines like silver.
AAD00105075	Relax, I only want to ask you some questions.
AAD00105076	And I only asked first... I'll try one more time before I find out the hard way. Where you come from, and where you going?
AAD00105077	I just want to talk to Alice or Andy.
AAD00105078	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
AAD00105079	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill you right here, right now.
AAD00105080	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler and Andy.
AAD00105081	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
AAD00105082	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill you right here, right now.
AAD00105083	I just want to talk to Alice or Andy.
AAD00105084	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill you right here, right now.
AAD00105085	I'm looking for Andy or Alice so we could talk.
AAD00105086	I'm ready to fight Lupa.
AAD00105087	You sure? Last chance to back out.
AAD00105088	I'm ready to fight Lupa now.
AAD00105089	All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
AAD00105090	I could use Lupa's brain to fix my cyber-dog.
AAD00105091	Cyber-dog? Like the ones I've seen up in Denver? I know what you're talking about, and it would make Lupa immortal in a way.
AAD00105092	You have an interesting name.
AAD00105093	Thank you. I change names and jobs every decade or so, just to keep things interesting. I picked "Calamity" this time because it sounded nice.
AAD00105094	Never really done much science stuff 'til now. I'm pretty good at it, or so Doctor Henry tells me.
AAD00105095	Does anyone other than Super Mutants come up this way?
AAD00105096	Prospectors looking for salvage, usually. They always run when they see the mutants.
AAD00105097	The Great Khans come this way once in a while, but they keep their distance. I think they're mostly keeping an eye on us.
AAD00105098	What do you do here?
AAD00105099	Most of the time, I'm Doctor Henry's research assistant. We're looking into ways to cure the, uh... 
AAD00105100	I'm also handy with tools, and once in awhile I venture down into the valley to trade the Bighorner hides and meat for supplies.
AAD00105101	Tell me about this area of New Vegas.
AAD00105102	Folks call this East Vegas, but I don't care much for names.
AAD00105103	The east side gets a lot of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
AAD00105104	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
AAD00105105	I mean you've got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
AAD00105106	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
AAD00105107	<GENERAL QUESTIONS>
AAD00105108	What do you want to know?
AAD00105109	I want you to head to Red Rock Canyon, north of here. Find Papa Khan and ask him if he'd allow the Powder Gangers to join up.
AAD00105110	<Lie> I've no idea what you're talking about.
AAD00105111	[SUCCEEDED] I've got my eye on you. Get the fuck off my turf.
AAD00105112	Anything you can help me with?
AAD00105113	Well, I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
AAD00105114	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
AAD00105115	Yeah, okay... I'll shoot the lock off the door and then... and.... Argh, dammit!
AAD00105116	... I can't do it, I can't. She deserves it, and worse, but I can't hurt my own mother!
AAD00105117	They care for you, in their own way.
AAD00105118	Do they? Look at my mother. All she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
AAD00105119	My father? A trading business that he'll never own, risking his neck every day against wastelanders and cut-throat "merchants."
AAD00105120	And I'm supposed to be part of those dreams? What about my dreams, stranger? What about me?
AAD00105121	Do you have the money?
AAD00105122	She's guarding it, I know she is!
AAD00105123	She locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
AAD00105124	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
AAD00105125	What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
AAD00105126	I just want to talk, that's all.
AAD00105127	[FAILED] I'm not a stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
AAD00105128	How did you kill that thing?
AAD00105129	With my bare hands. I would have shot it, but I was cleaning my gun when they swarmed the camp.
AAD00105130	The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into its back.
AAD00105131	Once he was on the ground, all it took was a bit of choking and punching to finish him off.
AAD00105132	<Use Doctor Bag to heal his leg> This should help fix up your leg.
AAD00105133	Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
AAD00105134	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
AAD00105135	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
AAD00105136	Great, I'll start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
AAD00105137	We need to clear the caves first.
AAD00105138	Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into those caves.
AAD00105139	You haven't seen what they did to the other troopers, and I'd rather not find out why they took all of the bodies.
AAD00105140	
AAD00105141	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you have a point. They were good men and deserved better.
AAD00105142	I can't guarantee I'll be much help against their numbers, but I'll do what I can. Chances are we won't get out of here alive anyway.
AAD00105143	If we don't clear the caves, your friends' deaths were for nothing. Can you live with that?
AAD00105144	[FAILED] Hey, I'm all for being a hero when the time is right, but there are at least 12 of those bastards lurking around in here.
AAD00105145	I'd rather not join my buddies any time soon.
AAD00105146	More people are going to die if we don't do something.
AAD00105147	Go ahead and start the tests.
AAD00105148	Very well. Please stand back - I don't want any erroneous readings. You're welcome to stay and observe if you want, though.
AAD00105149	Wait, Lily's not in position yet. Talk to me again once she's settled in.
AAD00105150	I'm looking into the Nightstalker mutation. Want to come along with me?
AAD00105151	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
AAD00105152	Grab the money and run far away.
AAD00105153	You really think I care about the money? I just... no, no, no!
AAD00105154	You should get out of here and never come back.
AAD00105155	You're right, there's no place for me here. Just... just tell them I'm sorry, and they won't have to worry about me, ever again.
AAD00105156	Trent Bascom says he's not getting his full allotment of water.
AAD00105157	The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
AAD00105158	Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
AAD00105159	If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
AAD00105160	What happens if Keene leaves?
AAD00105161	That happens, there's a good chance other Nightkin will follow. It'll make it hard to get a cure to them.
AAD00105162	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are gonna get killed.
AAD00105163	Most humans can't tell the difference between mutants. Might come here looking for payback.
AAD00105164	I'm looking for Corporal White. I was told that he'd spoken to you.
AAD00105165	Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
AAD00105166	White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
AAD00105167	The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
AAD00105168	Are you from California?
AAD00105169	Born and raised. Things back in California are better than they've ever been, according to my grandpa.
AAD00105170	The Raiders are mostly gone now and it's easy enough to get a job at one of the mills or farms. But now there's taxes and laws and other things.
AAD00105171	The NCR keeps things safe and orderly, but it's all very boring. So, I came out east towards the frontier.
AAD00105172	You don't look like a quarry worker.
AAD00105173	Oh, I'm not. I'm making my way to New Vegas. They say anything goes there, and best of all, the NCR can't mess it up for you.
AAD00105174	I'll get there eventually. I've heard that you can't even get into the Strip unless you're rich.
AAD00105175	You don't get paid in caps?
AAD00105176	Nope. The NCR's been trying to switch over to using paper money, just like in the Pre-War days. Trouble is that the exchange rates ain't exactly fair.
AAD00105177	For example, a hundred bucks in NCR money is valued at roughly half that in caps around here. Seems like a rotten deal for us, but work is work.
AAD00105178	What's a dragline?
AAD00105179	It's a big machine which moves rocks around, piles at a time. It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in a while to keep it running.
AAD00105180	I could take care of your Deathclaw problem.
AAD00105181	Have you ever seen a Deathclaw? They're taller than a man and far, far stronger and faster. And, there's a whole pack of them out there.
AAD00105182	You'd have to be the meanest, toughest, roughest bastard in the wasteland to have any chance against them, and I don't think that's you.
AAD00105183	You'd need to take out the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Kill 'em, and the pack will scatter. Pretty tough job.
AAD00105184	Goodbye.
AAD00105185	If you insist on going north, don't be expecting a rescue when you get into trouble.
AAD00105186	I'm familiar with explosives. Give it here.
AAD00105187	I'm familiar with explosives. Give it here.
AAD00105188	Let's get moving.
AAD00105189	You're the boss.
AAD00105190	I'll be in the crowd. Do whatever you need to do, then find me before Kimball arrives.
AAD00105191	Here's your disguise. This'll get you past most of the NCR there, but watch out for the rangers. Odds are this won't fool them.
AAD00105192	I'll meet you there. Good luck.
AAD00105193	What sort of information do you have?
AAD00105194	I've been spying in the dam for quite a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
AAD00105195	Of course I have a plan.
AAD00105196	Prepared already. I like it. There's no need to give me the details, it is probably best that way.
AAD00105197	Even though you already have a plan, I may have some information that you might find useful.
AAD00105198	Hand over the necklace, thief.
AAD00105199	Fat chance of that. What are you going to do if I don't?
AAD00105200	
AAD00105201	Pretty sure, yeah. It's really nice, isn't it? Have you ever seen caps with pretty blue stars on them like these?
AAD00105202	Are you sure that necklace is yours?
AAD00105203	About those chemical supplies...
AAD00105204	Still got 'em. You ready to pay up?
AAD00105205	You were already paid in advance.
AAD00105206	Yeah, and as it turns out, the advance wasn't enough. The price has gone up. That's just how it goes.
AAD00105207	A friend in Sloan told me to come to you about some chemical supplies.
AAD00105208	You trying to get me busted? Keep your damn voice down - Lieutenant Hayes already has his eye on me.
AAD00105209	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
AAD00105210	Keep your damn voice down. Even though Lieutenant Hayes got himself killed recently, somebody else might be watching me.
AAD00105211	Look, I already told Chomps the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
AAD00105212	Where can I find the rest of the Great Khans?
AAD00105213	Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come in.
AAD00105214	The NCR can't touch us there - too many places for us to ambush them. We see their scouts poking around once in a while, but they keep their distance.
AAD00105215	Got it. Let's talk about something else.
AAD00105216	Like what?
AAD00105217	No angle. I just want to help.
AAD00105218	I was expecting a shipment of chemicals. It's usually in a suitcase dropped off in one of the big machines up here.
AAD00105219	Because of the Deathclaws, I have to assume the suitcase is still in Sloan. Snoop around the place and get it for me.
AAD00105220	I'm looking for some Great Khans who stole something from me in Goodsprings.
AAD00105221	The only Khans this far into NCR territory is me and my crew, and I didn't steal squat from you.
AAD00105222	Besides, even if some of my gang did steal from you, I wouldn't rat them out. Loyalty actually means something to the Great Khans.
AAD00105223	As far as I know, it's just me and my crew out here, and if it really was Great Khans who mugged you, they didn't come this way. I'd have seen them.
AAD00105224	How's it going?
AAD00105225	<whuff>
AAD00105226	Will the White Glove Society ally with Caesar now?
AAD00105227	I should think so, but it would be up to Marjorie.
AAD00105228	I have, however, told her how instrumental you were in revolutionizing our cuisine. And she knows what we stand to gain from a ruler who supports it.
AAD00105229	Have a word with her, see what she says. I daresay she'll be more receptive with these new developments.
AAD00105230	What do you know about the President's visit?
AAD00105231	He's coming to give a big fancy speech to all of us troops stationed here at the dam.
AAD00105232	I'm pretty excited. He seems like such a nice guy and I get to meet him.
AAD00105233	He's giving me a medal. I don't know why though. I'm just doing my job like all the other guys. I'm still excited though.
AAD00105234	I can't believe someone killed President Kimball. He was such a nice guy, why would anyone want to hurt him?
AAD00105235	What are your responsibilities now?
AAD00105236	Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down.
AAD00105237	People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
AAD00105238	Like, hey Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
AAD00105239	He was hurting you?
AAD00105240	Ever since he lost his job a few years back he hasn't been the same. He took a switch to us for the tiniest things.
AAD00105241	We were trying to get away when the Legion showed up. I'm glad he ran off like a coward, but slavery wasn't the kind of escape I was looking for.
AAD00105242	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
AAD00105243	Don't tell me you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
AAD00105244	In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
AAD00105245	<Questions>
AAD00105246	Same stuff. Any NCR weapons, computer parts, or radio parts.
AAD00105247	I'll need more than that. Keep looking.
AAD00105248	Alright, thanks for the help. Time to die loser.
AAD00105249	<Questions>
AAD00105250	There's gotta be more than that, keep looking.
AAD00105251	Alright, we can move now. Here's the key to the Fire Station.
AAD00105252	<Questions>
AAD00105253	Yeah, I am. What of it?
AAD00105254	<Questions>
AAD00105255	Are you sure about that?
AAD00105256	How did you meet Doctor Henry?
AAD00105257	He and I had joined up with the same caravan. Add in a lot of whiskey, and, well, let's just say we got to know each other.
AAD00105258	Let's talk about Rey's brain.
AAD00105259	Like I said before, give me 700 caps and Rey's brain is yours.
AAD00105260	Never mind.
AAD00105261	All right, then.
AAD00105262	I don't have the caps with me right now.
AAD00105263	No worries. I'll hold onto these parts for you.
AAD00105264	250 caps it is. Here you go.
AAD00105265	Pleasure doing business with you.
AAD00105266	500 caps it is. Here you go.
AAD00105267	Pleasure doing business with you.
AAD00105268	< Speech - 50 >
AAD00105269	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Yes, you are quite the smoothtalker. What the hell - 250 it is.
AAD00105270	But you're going to cut the price to 250 because I'm just that charming, right?
AAD00105271	[FAILED] Oh, you're charming in your own way, I suppose. Not budging on the price for those parts, though.
AAD00105272	How about a discount? I'm a nice person.
AAD00105273	< Barter - 50 >
AAD00105274	[SUCCEEDED] Eh, fair enough. It's not like anyone's ever wanted to buy them before. 250 caps it is.
AAD00105275	250 caps. Unless you think you'll find another buyer soon for such specialized parts?
AAD00105276	[FAILED] Oh, I don't know about that. Lots of folks travel by on their way to New Vegas.
AAD00105277	You should cut down the price. It's not like anyone will probably buy them.
AAD00105278	About those thrust control modules...
AAD00105279	Still got 'em. 250 caps and they're yours.
AAD00105280	Still got them. 500 caps and they're yours.
AAD00105281	Do you have any thrust control modules from REPCONN in stock?
AAD00105282	As it so happens, I do have some thrust modules, but they're expensive. 500 caps worth of expensive.
AAD00105283	Did you ever salvage containers of radioactive material from REPCONN?
AAD00105284	Doctor Henry sent me. I need a new brain for my cyber-dog.
AAD00105285	Doctor Henry? Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Hard to believe he's still alive.
AAD00105286	As for your request, it's, uh, a bit ghoulish if you ask me, but Rey is pretty old and I'll probably have to put him down soon enough.
AAD00105287	As for the price for this favor, 700 caps sounds about right. Rey's like family, and I've got other dogs to take care of.
AAD00105288	An attractive woman like yourself all alone? Maybe you and I could work out some kind of trade...
AAD00105289	I know I'm not young and pretty any more, but I appreciate the thought all the same. Here, take the parts, you flatterer.
AAD00105290	It'll be more fun if we keep it a mystery. Besides, I'm more interested in you.
AAD00105291	You're right. I'm sorry. That imbecile in the next room has me on edge. I used to be more fun.
AAD00105292	I'm still passionate about my work though. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
AAD00105293	I'm in the Followers of the Apocalypse. How about you?
AAD00105294	How about you and I come to another arrangement. It'll be worth it - trust me.
AAD00105295	Well, it's been awhile. All right, let's do this.
AAD00105296	You mentioned someone named Festus. Who's that?
AAD00105297	It's said that the treasure is guarded by a man named Festus, and he's the one who asks for the blue-star caps.
AAD00105298	It's also said he's been around since the war, standing a lonely vigil, waiting for someone to come and take the treasure off his hands.
AAD00105299	That'd make him pretty damn old, but I've met a few people in my travels who claimed they actually met him, and they weren't the lying type either.
AAD00105300	What do you do here?
AAD00105301	The Followers of the Apocalypse aren't just interested in research. We care for our fellow man and do everything we can to help humanity.
AAD00105302	Here in Freeside, we provide food and medical services for those in need. We also have organized reconstruction efforts.
AAD00105303	With the help of Bill Ronte, we were able to install a water pump just west of here, but the Kings quickly took control of the pump.
AAD00105304	Simple. I turned him in.
AAD00105305	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! You're going to pay for that!
AAD00105306	LtHayesVMS04ExposeChomps
AAD00105307	All right. I'll have him brought in for questioning.
AAD00105308	Chomps Lewis, the foreman at Sloan, was also involved.
AAD00105309	LtMarklandTraining
AAD00105310	Thank you, that was very helpful. I don't think I'll need those books after all.
AAD00105311	Who did this to you?
AAD00105312	Unh... Legion caught me. Said this... was the penalty for drug runners. Please... let me down.
AAD00105313	What do you think of the Great Khans?
AAD00105314	[FAILED] Alas, my first loyalty is to Caesar, and a soldier cannot have two masters.
AAD00105315	I've been wondering why you don't petition the Khans for membership as a show of allegiance.
AAD00105316	Regis says I should talk to you about speaking against the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AAD00105317	You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about the life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
AAD00105318	I've been told you're someone I should talk to about stopping the Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AAD00105319	Don't worry, Jack and I have talked it over. We'll talk up the idea of breaking the alliance.
AAD00105320	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
AAD00105321	Anders got back a little while before you did, he told me what happened. If that's how the Legion treats my people, I don't want any part of them.
AAD00105322	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
AAD00105323	Hey, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
AAD00105324	I'm here to ask you to publicly oppose Papa Khan's alliance with Caesar.
AAD00105325	Oh, it's cool, man. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
AAD00105326	Oh, it's cool, man, I got your back.
AAD00105327	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AAD00105328	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AAD00105329	Oh, it's cool, kitten. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
AAD00105330	Oh, it's cool, kitty cat, I got your back.
AAD00105331	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
AAD00105332	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
AAD00105333	RegisCaesar
AAD00105334	I heard you try to convince Papa Khan not to join with Caesar's Legion. I'd like to talk to you about that for a moment.
AAD00105335	What do you want to know?
AAD00105336	I'd like to talk more about the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
AAD00105337	You should look at this. It's Karl's journal, and it's very revealing of his true opinions.
AAD00105338	Let me see that... "filthy savages? Probably have to decimate the lot of them?" Are these the words of our "friend," Caesar?
AAD00105339	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AAD00105340	Pretty please?
AAD00105341	Okay, just this once. Make it quick though, I don't want to get in trouble for this.
AAD00105342	<Questions>
AAD00105343	Who is Private Edwards?
AAD00105344	SSHQAllenMarksAudioLog01
AAD00105345	I guess this is it. Not much air left now. Minutes, maybe. And this is what I have to show for it.
AAD00105346	I guess the joke's <gasps air> on me. Prolly shouldn't have killed... all those people. Prolly shoulda stayed at home... and taken care of my ma.
AAD00105347	She... always used to say people who... murder and steal... die bad in the end. Said they...
AAD00105348	I'm gonna need more than that if you want my help.
AAD00105349	[SUCCEEDED] I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
AAD00105350	Is there somewhere else he can go?
AAD00105351	There's a Ranger station north of here that has a few ghouls running it. Maybe they'll take him in.
AAD00105352	But he isn't feral.
AAD00105353	Doesn't mean he isn't suffering, or that he won't go feral eventually.
AAD00105354	There may be a battle in the near future at the Hoover Dam. Can you offer any assistance?
AAD00105355	Of course, my child. After all that you have done for us we would love to help you in the upcoming battle.
AAD00105356	After all the training in virtual reality, the young ones would relish an opportunity to put their skills to battle. We'll be there when you need us.
AAD00105357	You're with the Legion?
AAD00105358	Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magical angel wings.
AAD00105359	They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought the fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
AAD00105360	Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
AAD00105361	Do you see much action against the NCR?
AAD00105362	As much as their cowardice will allow. The Profligates avoid open battle, but on good days we find one of their patrols.
AAD00105363	Their landmines have caused us more trouble than their marksmanship - which is lacking.
AAD00105364	We're all fine here, thank you. How are you?
AAD00105365	Quit goofing off and clear the channel. I'll be damned if the President dies on my watch because you were screwing around.
AAD00105366	Any way I can help?
AAD00105367	Help? No, look, I apprec... You know, what, yes, I could use the help. And you look like you can handle yourself.
AAD00105368	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
AAD00105369	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
AAD00105370	It's either him or the wasteland.
AAD00105371	I think I'll take my chances with the wasteland.
AAD00105372	I heard Ranger Station Echo up north is manned by other ghouls.
AAD00105373	There's a Ranger Station run by ghouls? Finally, I feel like I have a place to go. Thanks for your help.
AAD00105374	Maybe First Sergeant Astor will let you join him?
AAD00105375	Are you sure he'll be okay with it? Not everyone is crazy about ghouls.
AAD00105376	There are plenty of places out in the wasteland.
AAD00105377	You know what? Why the hell not. There are plenty of places out there to explore, and I'm kinda tired of being stuck in this house.
AAD00105378	Actually, let's talk about something else.
AAD00105379	Okay.
AAD00105380	Can I ask you something else?
AAD00105381	Is that the only thing you're afraid of?
AAD00105382	Radscorpions. Fuckers creep the hell out of me. I'm not going outside while they're still crawling around.
AAD00105383	Can you tell me what happened here?
AAD00105384	I don't really know the details of it, it all happened too quickly. I remember being hit by a blast of energy.
AAD00105385	Next thing I know, I wake up like... like this. I've been staying in this house ever since.
AAD00105386	I don't know much about what's going on outside, aside from the creatures that moved in since then.
AAD00105387	Actually, I have another question.
AAD00105388	Can I have your dog tag?
AAD00105389	Sorry, I'm not about to give it up. It's the only thing I have left that reminds me of who I was.
AAD00105390	Goodbye.
AAD00105391	Later.
AAD00105392	CalamityToDoctorHenry01
AAD00105393	Stealth field is stable, and the readings are clean. Gamma wave activity is... zero? Odd, but everything looks right.
AAD00105394	The stealth field is unstable and scrambling things. The reading says gamma wave activity is zero, but that can't possibly be right.
AAD00105395	Gamma wave activity is... zero? That can't be right. Must be a result of the interference.
AAD00105396	I should be going.
AAD00105397	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
AAD00105398	Now take the Platinum Chip, go down to that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find. Now get to it. Vale.
AAD00105399	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
AAD00105400	Now take the Platinum Chip, go down to that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find.
AAD00105401	And just in case you're thinking of slipping away, now that you've finally got that Platinum Chip in your hands?
AAD00105402	Go ahead, try that. And I'll have you hunted down, and your head mounted on a pole. Now get to it. Vale.
AAD00105403	I'll kill President Kimball for you.
AAD00105404	That's what I like to hear.
AAD00105405	One of my Frumentarii has set up camp near Hoover Dam. His name is Cato Hostilius.
AAD00105406	Go to him. He'll have further instructions.
AAD00105407	Is it really necessary to destroy the Brotherhood?
AAD00105408	If I say the Brotherhood should be destroyed, it's necessary.
AAD00105409	My Legion can win a fight against the Brotherhood of Steel, but it would be costly. Your job is to make sure there's no Brotherhood for us to fight.
AAD00105410	I'll see what I can work out with the White Glove Society.
AAD00105411	The leader of the tribe is a woman named Marjorie. My understanding is that she strongly opposes a reversion to cannibalism.
AAD00105412	If she's intractable, you might find Mortimer, her second-in-command, more flexible.
AAD00105413	You don't need to look outward, mighty Khan. Your tribe is proud and strong - claim your own glory!
AAD00105414	[SUCCEEDED] Well spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
AAD00105415	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AAD00105416	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
AAD00105417	[SUCCEEDED] Well spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
AAD00105418	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
AAD00105419	But you won't have each other. The Legion will kill you and sell Diane into slavery as a prostitute.
AAD00105420	[SUCCEEDED] Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diane got your back. No sweat.
AAD00105421	What about Melissa?
AAD00105422	Ah, Melissa. She's a bit of a dreamer. Last time she was in camp, Karl filled her head with stories of serving the Legion as a speculatore.
AAD00105423	Personally, I've never seen a woman in Legionnaire's armor, so I have my doubts.
AAD00105424	So what do I do?
AAD00105425	Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack, Diane, and Melissa.
AAD00105426	If you can convince all of us that allying with Caesar is a bad idea, you might be able to sway him.
AAD00105427	What is it you had in mind?
AAD00105428	You want to convince Papa not to ally with Caesar, right? Trust me, you'll get nowhere just talking to him about it.
AAD00105429	He's fixated on restoring the glory of the Great Khans, and he sees Caesar as the path to that restoration.
AAD00105430	Sounds good.
AAD00105431	Well, I'm glad I have your approval.
AAD00105432	I have access, right?
AAD00105433	Not a chance. Only the necessary personnel have authorization.
AAD00105434	I'm going to need access everywhere.
AAD00105435	Alright, I'll give you full access.
AAD00105436	So what's the plan for today?
AAD00105437	The plan is to get through today without the shit hitting the fan.
AAD00105438	So I'll be overseeing the security team personally and keeping in constant contact with people over the radio.
AAD00105439	It's a good bet that the Legion is going to try something today so we have to be prepared for anything.
AAD00105440	We'll do whatever it takes to get the President through this visit in one piece.
AAD00105441	What can I do to help?
AAD00105442	Someone like you... I'm just glad to have you on board. Do whatever you can. Security sweeps, talk to people, keep an eye out.
AAD00105443	Keep an eye on the crowd and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Other than that, just stay out of the way.
AAD00105444	Do you have any leads on possible security threats?
AAD00105445	The Legion will definitely try something, but we don't have any solid leads yet.
AAD00105446	I'd almost expect something direct from them, but given the circumstances there's a possibility of something more subtle, like sabotage.
AAD00105447	But since we don't have anything solid, we'll just have to keep our eyes out for anything out of the ordinary.
AAD00105448	Possible security threats... there was a new guy allowed to help with security at the last minute. Other than that, we don't have any solid leads.
AAD00105449	Do you have a detailed schedule for the visit?
AAD00105450	I have a full itinerary here. Here you go.
AAD00105451	The President arrives, gives a speech, and then leaves. That's all someone like you needs to know.
AAD00105452	Can I use my weapons during the President's visit?
AAD00105453	We trust you, so you're free to have your weapons. Just don't do anything too crazy and we'll back you up.
AAD00105454	You'll be allowed to carry your weapons, but they must remain holstered.
AAD00105455	If you pull them out, my men will shoot you. Understand?
AAD00105456	Before I take care of them, can I ask you about your dog tag?
AAD00105457	What do you want to know?
AAD00105458	What's the history of the camp?
AAD00105459	I know that this place was originally a mining town before the NCR took it over. I think they mined gold before the war.
AAD00105460	Sorry I don't know much more than that.
AAD00105461	Astor has agreed to let you join him.
AAD00105462	Maybe now I can get my old life back, or at least most of it.
AAD00105463	It's not much, but I want you to have this.
AAD00105464	I've already reverted the White Glove Society back to cannibalism.
AAD00105465	All right, that's a start. But now you have to convince them to support my Legion.
AAD00105466	Tell them they'll be allowed to continue practicing their dietary habits without interruption. They can eat a portion of what they conquer.
AAD00105467	Do you have any dealings with New Vegas?
AAD00105468	Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
AAD00105469	Amazes me people would come from all over the wastes to throw away everything they've got in that town.
AAD00105470	Because you know they'd come up lacking?
AAD00105471	[FAILED] Win? I wasn't aware we were competing.
AAD00105472	Well spoken. You win this round.
AAD00105473	But surely a warrior in service of glorious Caesar is the equal of any tribe's finest?
AAD00105474	[FAILED] You insult our host, where I wouldn't dare to. You might want to watch that talk around Papa Khan.
AAD00105475	Wow, you're not worthy to join a scruffy tribe of has-been desert raiders? You must suck.
AAD00105476	Let's get this over with then.
AAD00105477	Well spoken.
AAD00105478	RRCLegionAmbush
AAD00105479	Karl sends his regards.
AAD00105480	You don't give up, do you?
AAD00105481	My dog here doesn't like you.
AAD00105482	Well that's too bad. I'm just here to enjoy the show so if you don't mind...
AAD00105483	<Raise arms> Boogedy boogedy boo!
AAD00105484	What are you working on?
AAD00105485	The Nightkin have varying degrees of mental instability due to their addiction to Stealth Boy use. I've been trying to come up with a cure.
AAD00105486	I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
AAD00105487	I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
AAD00105488	What's the story with Keene?
AAD00105489	Smart, charismatic. One hell of a mean streak. Doesn't care for humans. Prefers fighting them to talking.
AAD00105490	He's got a lot of pull with Nightkin, though. He talks, they listen. Was hoping he could draw other Nightkin to Jacobstown.
AAD00105491	Keene is saner than most, but I know he's thinking of going his own way again. He's aggressive, impatient. Can't stand sitting around.
AAD00105492	Sure, what have you got?
AAD00105493	With Anders out of commission for so long, we're shorthanded on runners, and some backlogs have piled up.
AAD00105494	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
AAD00105495	You up for something challenging?
AAD00105496	I've got a shipment of Jet and Psycho that needs to be delivered to Motor-Runner at Vault 3.
AAD00105497	What do you have for sale?
AAD00105498	Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
AAD00105499	I know a few recipes for chems you might want. I could teach you.
AAD00105500	Right on. What have you got?
AAD00105501	I'm looking to make a few caps. Got any work for me?
AAD00105502	Hmm... you look like you could handle yourself in a fix. All right, I'll tell you what. Anders, one of my best runners, is overdue to report back.
AAD00105503	If you can find out what happened to him, I'll give you some real work.
AAD00105504	And you didn't even get skinned alive. I'm impressed. Here's your payment.
AAD00105505	I finished the Vault 3 run.
AAD00105506	Yeah, you did good finding him. Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
AAD00105507	Now that Anders is back, how about that work?
AAD00105508	Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
AAD00105509	Any new jobs for me?
AAD00105510	Not right at the moment, but you could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
AAD00105511	Any new jobs for me?
AAD00105512	I know who they are, but I don't care about their agenda.
AAD00105513	They're usually harmless unless you use advanced technology around them.
AAD00105514	Well, that shouldn't be a problem for me. I can't afford anything like that.
AAD00105515	I need repairs.
AAD00105516	All right then... just sign here, here, and... here.
AAD00105517	I'm still working on it. May I ask you some questions?
AAD00105518	The Khans will accept you as long as you pass the initiation rite.
AAD00105519	Well, that's a hell of a lot better than going back to prison.
AAD00105520	I'll do it.
AAD00105521	Thanks. Take this keycard - I tried hacking the locking mechanisms on the doors, but it seems the only way in is with one of these.
AAD00105522	Yes. You can join them, but he says you would all still have to pass the initiation rite.
AAD00105523	I'd rather not, but fair enough. We'll do it.
AAD00105524	Tell me about the Super Mutants.
AAD00105525	Tell me about the Super Mutants.
AAD00105526	Tell me about the Super Mutants.
AAD00105527	Tell me about the Super Mutants.
AAD00105528	Tell me about the Super Mutants.
AAD00105529	Tell me about the area outside the vault.
AAD00105530	It's a fucking deathtrap around here. Fiends swarm all over Vault 3 in the east, and there are fucking Deathclaws south of that, at Quarry Junction.
AAD00105531	If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us, and there's an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
AAD00105532	Tell me about the prison break.
AAD00105533	A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the NCR.
AAD00105534	I can teach you to make Rocket.
AAD00105535	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AAD00105536	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AAD00105537	I was thinking Rocket, but now I'm not so sure.
AAD00105538	I can teach you to make Party-Time Mentats.
AAD00105539	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AAD00105540	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AAD00105541	I was thinking Party-Time Mentats, but now I'm not so sure.
AAD00105542	I can teach you to make Slasher.
AAD00105543	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AAD00105544	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AAD00105545	I was thinking Slasher, but now I'm not so sure.
AAD00105546	I can teach you to make Hydra.
AAD00105547	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AAD00105548	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AAD00105549	I was thinking Hydra, but now I'm not so sure.
AAD00105550	I can teach you to make Super Stimpaks.
AAD00105551	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
AAD00105552	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
AAD00105553	I was thinking Super Stimpacks, but now I'm not so sure.
AAD00105554	Medical supplies are always scarce, and they don't kill the buyer as often. Think of the profits!
AAD00105555	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a point. Selling meds to the locals could be a pretty nice side gig. All right, I'll tell Jack to give it a try.
AAD00105556	But think of all the people who overdose on Jet and Psycho. It's bad for your karma.
AAD00105557	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa... you're right. I should start a side project making meds to keep my aura clean.
AAD00105558	Where exactly are we going?
AAD00105559	We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
AAD00105560	I found the keys on one of the trooper corpses.
AAD00105561	Okay. I'll be back.
AAD00105562	Just go, already.
AAD00105563	I'll check it out.
AAD00105564	Yeah, you do that.
AAD00105565	Who is your employer?
AAD00105566	Some caravan company, Crimson something or other. Some old broad said they were looking to expand their business, be more competitive or some shit.
AAD00105567	I don't really care, so long as I get paid.
AAD00105568	Maybe I can help?
AAD00105569	Look, if you really want to help, either get the fuck out of our way or hack that damn computer over there.
AAD00105570	What is this initiation?
AAD00105571	Everybody has to do it. Well, everybody who wants to be a Khan, anyways. They toss you into the ring there and beat on you for a solid minute.
AAD00105572	If you survive, you're in.
AAD00105573	I took care of those geckos.
AAD00105574	You won't get a fucking cap from me, and you're lucky I don't blow your goddamn head off.
AAD00105575	The whole point of killing the geckos was so that we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
AAD00105576	What's going on here?
AAD00105577	After you cut off access to the sulfur, Cooke left. I guess we're free to surrender to the NCR now.
AAD00105578	We're waiting on you. A lot of us are interested in joining the Khans.
AAD00105579	I'd like to, but I can't take you with me right now.
AAD00105580	Aw, you really know how to make a girl feel like a stray cat.
AAD00105581	But okay. My offer stands, if we run into each other again.
AAD00105582	I killed them all.
AAD00105583	God, you're not lying, are you? You really did kill them.
AAD00105584	In that case, this is for them.
AAD00105585	Can you tell me anything about this Platinum Chip?
AAD00105586	<Kill Benny in his sleep.>
AAD00105587	Huh...? Hnngk!
AAD00105588	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, just like Mr. House wants.
AAD00105589	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
AAD00105590	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
AAD00105591	So all you gotta do is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
AAD00105592	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
AAD00105593	He gave me the Platinum Chip.
AAD00105594	Sure, Baldie wants you to go down there in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
AAD00105595	Oh, you don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
AAD00105596	You go down there and you use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
AAD00105597	I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
AAD00105598	Looks like you played past your abilities.
AAD00105599	Didn't leave me much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
AAD00105600	Hand over the Platinum Chip, maybe you live.
AAD00105601	Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's... special. But savor this, baby...
AAD00105602	I can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
AAD00105603	Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
AAD00105604	I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
AAD00105605	Mr. House wants the Platinum Chip. Hand it over.
AAD00105606	You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
AAD00105607	Pass the time thinking over your mistakes. <Final decision.>
AAD00105608	You sick, vindictive fuck!
AAD00105609	Tell me about the Three Families.
AAD00105610	Set it up right, and the Families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
AAD00105611	Why shouldn't Mr. House run Vegas?
AAD00105612	Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
AAD00105613	Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone's gotta do what he says. You're just figuring that out?
AAD00105614	Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
AAD00105615	Okay, I'll take care of him.
AAD00105616	Thanks for your support. I'll make sure the NCR Emergency radio is up and running. Go kill those bastards.
AAD00105617	What opportunity is that?
AAD00105618	We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf.
AAD00105619	I am in the beginning stages of planning out an assault on The Fort. I've made calls to our allies, and they are on their way to our position.
AAD00105620	Once our forces are in place and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
AAD00105621	It sounds like you're not happy being a Great Khan. Maybe you'd be happier someplace else.
AAD00105622	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I can find my true calling, someplace they'll appreciate my poetry! Someplace like the Old Mormon Fort, maybe.
AAD00105623	Do you think the Followers of the Apocalypse would take me? I remember all those books they brought us when they visited our tribe.
AAD00105624	It can't be as hard as all that. What needs to get done?
AAD00105625	Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get this whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
AAD00105626	I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
AAD00105627	I've brought a brain to transplant into Rex.
AAD00105628	I can probably handle that. Just the same as changing a light bulb, except stickier and smellier. Right?
AAD00105629	Anyway, what did you bring me?
AAD00105630	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
AAD00105631	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
AAD00105632	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
AAD00105633	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
AAD00105634	Hey, you said you would help clear the caves.
AAD00105635	I know, but now that I can see the way out, I'm not so sure. I'd rather not join my dead buddies anytime soon.
AAD00105636	I'm going to start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
AAD00105637	Would it be so bad to lend them the armor for the battle?
AAD00105638	[SUCCEEDED] It would mean more people better protected and able to fight.
AAD00105639	vHDPowerArmor
AAD00105640	This is unacceptable, we demand the immediate return of our power armor.
AAD00105641	A battle is about to be fought out there, to come here requesting our men to give up their armor is insane.
AAD00105642	It is not your armor, that power armor is property of the Brotherhood of Steel and you have no right to claim it as your own.
AAD00105643	You won't have any more trouble with those mercenaries.
AAD00105644	Good. Glad you didn't kill them. Letting them walk away proves we're not bloodthirsty mutants.
AAD00105645	If NCR or anybody else is looking for an excuse to attack Jacobstown, they're not going to get it from us.
AAD00105646	Here's your money - 2000 caps, as we agreed.
AAD00105647	All right, then. We'll be on our way.
AAD00105648	Here's your money - 2500 caps.
AAD00105649	A deal's a deal. We'll be on our way.
AAD00105650	< Barter - 55 >
AAD00105651	[SUCCEEDED] That thought had crossed my mind as well, actually. Fine, make it 2000 caps and we'll call it square.
AAD00105652	2500 caps? I'm doing you a favor by paying you now. I doubt you were expected to survive this.
AAD00105653	[FAILED] Sorry, but I've got my men to pay and equipment to maintain. 2500 caps or no deal.
AAD00105654	2500 caps is too much. Can't we come to a deal on a lower price?
AAD00105655	What do you want with Jacobstown?
AAD00105656	Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we'll let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
AAD00105657	Either way, the job's not done until they're cleared out of the town.
AAD00105658	What do you want me to do?
AAD00105659	You're human - they might be willing to listen to what you have to say. Maybe.
AAD00105660	I'm not asking you to kill them. Just talk them into leaving. Hell, pay them off if you have to.
AAD00105661	Can I get the abridged version?
AAD00105662	Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I do tend to get wrapped up in my own theories and forget that not everyone finds them as fascinating as I do.
AAD00105663	Here, I salvaged this book from an old library. It's a history of people called the Mongols. I think that's what the Khans built their culture on.
AAD00105664	You should read it, it's fascinating stuff.
AAD00105665	Who is Ezekiel?
AAD00105666	He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is Pre-War history and tribal culture.
AAD00105667	I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans. He kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
AAD00105668	Consider it done.
AAD00105669	What?... Really?! You're mad, but I like it!
AAD00105670	According to the notes you gave me, all of the southern raiding parties come from that camp. Caesar regularly sends fresh squads to relieve patrols.
AAD00105671	Killing their Centurion and leadership would be a start, but finding a way to permanently shut down that dock is what we really need.
AAD00105672	I already took care of the camp.
AAD00105673	What?! How'd you pull it off?
AAD00105674	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, thanks to the Chip.
AAD00105675	So all of this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
AAD00105676	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
AAD00105677	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
AAD00105678	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
AAD00105679	We should go after the vegetation technology.
AAD00105680	Okay. What better way to persuade them than to give them a taste of what they stand to gain, right?
AAD00105681	Maybe the best place to start is to see what we can find out directly from the NCR. Let's head to their OSI office at McCarran.
AAD00105682	The rangefinder sounds promising.
AAD00105683	They defended HELIOS like it was their last stand. Didn't even know if there was anything worth defending. How could there be, with all we lost?
AAD00105684	Even if it did work, it'd be under NCR control now. So it'd either prove our goals are wrong or we're incapable of pursuing them.
AAD00105685	There's a pawn shop in Outer Vegas we could check. And I've heard of a gift shop in the Strip that deals in Pre-War antiques.
AAD00105686	Let's pursue the pulse gun.
AAD00105687	Yeah, maybe they'll think twice about engaging the NCR if they know one of those could be floating around.
AAD00105688	The notes say to look around Nellis Air Force Base. He suggests going through filing cabinets and computers in the commanding officer's quarters.
AAD00105689	Father Elijah?
AAD00105690	Our Elder before McNamara. He had a nose for recovering lost technology. He'd send Scribes out into the desert chasing whatever leads he found.
AAD00105691	There were a few he only trusted me with. I can think of at least one that'd prove my point, if it still exists.
AAD00105692	There's a comm terminal not too far from here I'd use to access messages from him. If we go there I can pull up his research on it.
AAD00105693	What could we bring to him that would change his mind?
AAD00105694	I don't know. I don't know. We'd need something that shows the Brotherhood will fail. Or that it can do better a different way.
AAD00105695	The only thing that'd get his attention is technology.
AAD00105696	Huh. Maybe Father Elijah had the right idea.
AAD00105697	What is it?
AAD00105698	The Brotherhood is failing. I've always known that. If we don't change course, we're going to fall apart or... fade away.
AAD00105699	But until recently I haven't understood where we went wrong, or how to fix it.
AAD00105700	I think I need to go home.
AAD00105701	How goes your research for the Nightkin cure?
AAD00105702	Promising, but I won't be able to synthesize the drug anytime soon. I really should get back to my work.
AAD00105703	I'm wounded.
AAD00105704	Your injuries aren't too severe. I can patch the scrapes and lacerations pretty easily.
AAD00105705	Some of these lacerations are pretty severe and could get infected.
AAD00105706	I'm surprised you're still standing. You've lost a lot of blood and should be stabilized immediately.
AAD00105707	I want to be more intelligent.
AAD00105708	Your higher brain functions are off the charts.
AAD00105709	For 4,000 caps, I can install a Logic Co-Processor.
AAD00105710	I think you would really benefit from the Logic Co-Processor implant, so I'm going to cut the price to 3,000.
AAD00105711	What's your story?
AAD00105712	Well, I've lived in Nevada all my life. Started out in New Reno, but headed down here as soon as I got the chance.
AAD00105713	If you can believe it, things are even worse back home. The whole city's still run by crime families. Used to be the Mordinos and Wrights.
AAD00105714	Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never got better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
AAD00105715	I'm here for my "special" order.
AAD00105716	Yeah, it just came in. Here's all of it.
AAD00105717	I'm here to talk to you about our new "business" arrangement.
AAD00105718	Oh... that. Yeah. Anderson filled me in on the details. Just let me know when you'd like your... order to be filled.
AAD00105719	Goodbye.
AAD00105720	See you later.
AAD00105721	Who do you sell to?
AAD00105722	We make regular shipments to a lot of settlements around the Mojave - a lot of our business comes from the Fiends lately.
AAD00105723	Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact they get all hopped up on Psycho and harass the NCR patrols.
AAD00105724	What alliance?
AAD00105725	Papa Khan has been talking to Caesar's emissary for weeks now - they're always going on about crushing the NCR.
AAD00105726	Papa's announced that if Caesar goes to war against the NCR, the Khans will go with him.
AAD00105727	Tell me a little about the Great Khans.
AAD00105728	I'll spare you the history lesson - talk to Papa Khan if you want to hear that story.
AAD00105729	Things have been rough for a while now, even with Jack working all the time and my runners making deliveries daily we're barely getting by.
AAD00105730	Maybe this alliance with Caesar will help, but I don't know.
AAD00105731	What did you mean about Papa's hatred poisoning his mind?
AAD00105732	Nothing, forget about it. I shouldn't be talking about this with an outsider.
AAD00105733	I probably shouldn't be saying anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
AAD00105734	This alliance with Caesar, for one thing - I have my doubts about it.
AAD00105735	<Lie> I'm not sure what happened to it.
AAD00105736	Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
AAD00105737	The Legion took it from me at the Fort.
AAD00105738	So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
AAD00105739	Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
AAD00105740	This is your home, and these are your friends. You should stay.
AAD00105741	They may be a bunch of wooden conformists, but anything I did without them would feel... empty.
AAD00105742	I'd always be reminded of this day. How I wasn't strong enough to stand by them.
AAD00105743	So, I guess I'll stay. Won't be easy, but at least I won't feel guilty about the choice.
AAD00105744	I want to buy an implant.
AAD00105745	One other thing I forgot to mention - your body may be able to handle only a limited number of implants.
AAD00105746	The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able to give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
AAD00105747	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
AAD00105748	I'm afraid you can't handle any more implants right now. Your body isn't durable enough to take it. Sorry.
AAD00105749	I'm giving leadership to you. I want you to take the tribe north, and find yourselves a new life.
AAD00105750	Very well. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do.
AAD00105751	I'll start the preparations and we'll leave when the NCR is distracted by Caesar's attack.
AAD00105752	The Followers have agreed to take you on as a member. Head to the Old Mormon Fort.
AAD00105753	They did? That's great! Thank you! I'm out of this crummy camp!
AAD00105754	I met a kid who's unsatisfied with life in the Great Khans. Will you take him on as a Follower?
AAD00105755	We're always looking for new members. Does he have any particular talent?
AAD00105756	Nope, I'm getting out of here.
AAD00105757	Look, I'm not leaving this place until I have what I came for. I'll be in the storage basement if you change your mind.
AAD00105758	I don't have the caps right now.
AAD00105759	No need to apologize.
AAD00105760	Here's 500 caps.
AAD00105761	Very much appreciated. These caps will go towards funding schools and other services to the poorer part of the community.
AAD00105762	Tell me about the clinic.
AAD00105763	Can you make me luckier?
AAD00105764	Huh. I've never seen a coin toss go someone's way that many times. You certainly don't need the help of a Probability Calculator implant.
AAD00105765	In fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
AAD00105766	I have the Gun Runner holotape.
AAD00105767	The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll likely be aware of the theft soon enough.
AAD00105768	This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
AAD00105769	The Crimson Caravan Company no longer has to worry about Henry Jamison.
AAD00105770	Yes, but at significant cost. I understand you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
AAD00105771	I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
AAD00105772	What other work do you have available?
AAD00105773	As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
AAD00105774	There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
AAD00105775	There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
AAD00105776	And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runners' manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
AAD00105777	I'm looking for work.
AAD00105778	I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravanners or guards, but I am in need of a runner.
AAD00105779	I'm here to talk about ending your employment with the Crimson Caravan Company.
AAD00105780	Fuck, no. No matter what that old bitch McLafferty says, my dad said I could be in charge of the New Vegas branch.
AAD00105781	Besides, I got into a little money trouble with the Omertas. If I quit the Crimson Caravan, how am I supposed to get the money to gamble?
AAD00105782	I need to be reminded about a job you wanted me to do.
AAD00105783	Very well. What job did you need more information on?
AAD00105784	CaptainParkerArrest
AAD00105785	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling and the sale of unlicensed chems.
AAD00105786	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for the sale of unlicensed chems.
AAD00105787	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling.
AAD00105788	Come quietly now, I don't want to have to hurt you.
AAD00105789	You son of a bitch!
AAD00105790	Do you have enough scrap metal yet?
AAD00105791	It looks like that last bit you brought me was enough to fill the quota.
AAD00105792	Here are the caps I promised you. Make sure to let Contreras know the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
AAD00105793	Maybe I could help you out with those supplies.
AAD00105794	Well, I guess so. Look. We just need metal, and lots of it.
AAD00105795	We can handle the weapons, we just need extra scrap to melt down for the bullets.
AAD00105796	I'll give you some caps for each piece of metal you can bring me. Anything like scrap, cans, or any basic junk made of metal will do.
AAD00105797	I'll need at least 100 pieces to have enough for the bullets. I'll cash in whatever you've got until we have enough. Good luck.
AAD00105798	< Speech 80 >
AAD00105799	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I suppose we could refurbish used and damaged weapons to fill the order.
AAD00105800	They'll be in like new condition and then we can use our loader to make fresh ammo from spent brass.
AAD00105801	We'll have to wait a few days for gunpowder, but this might just work out. Tell Contreras the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
AAD00105802	Gun Runners are skilled enough to refurbish weapons like new, right? You're overthinking this.
AAD00105803	< Barter 80 >
AAD00105804	[SUCCEEDED] I guess we'll have to. If Caesar's Legion drives the NCR from the area, there goes ninety percent of our business.
AAD00105805	I don't like the idea of buying supplies from our competition, but it's only temporary. We'll call in extra supplies from our distributors.
AAD00105806	Let Contreras know we'll have the extra guns and ammo ready for the next shipment.
AAD00105807	Arrange a temporary supply deal with other merchants. It'll still lead to a profit for you.
AAD00105808	[FAILED] Oh hell, no. Working with our competition is not an option.
AAD00105809	Just buy the supplies from the other merchants around here. Easy enough.
AAD00105810	Contreras sent me. McCarran needs a lot more guns and ammo.
AAD00105811	Shit. Is he serious? The 25% increase in weapons is doable, but a 50% increase in ammunition is nuts.
AAD00105812	Just don't have the supplies on hand to meet that kind of demand for new weapons.
AAD00105813	So you work for the Gun Runners?
AAD00105814	For around five years now. I handle the supply end of things - raw materials and stuff.
AAD00105815	MusicIntroGeneric
AAD00105816	Coming up, I've got some tunes I think all of you are gonna like.
AAD00105817	More music, just ahead.
AAD00105818	I'd like to play something special for you right now. Because you deserve it.
AAD00105819	You're gonna love this next song. I guarantee it.
AAD00105820	More tracks. Coming your way. Right now.
AAD00105821	Stick around. We've got some great songs coming up for you.
AAD00105822	This next song is... just magical. I hope you enjoy.
AAD00105823	This next song helped me through a very difficult time in my life. I hope one day it can do the same for you.
AAD00105824	NewsStory
AAD00105825	Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has died in a tragic revolver-cleaning accident inside his locked office at Camp Golf.
AAD00105826	Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has unexpectedly passed away. NCR soldiers rallied to show their support for the officer.
AAD00105827	The Kings have been killed in a fight with NCR forces after weeks of mounting hostility. Witnesses report The King's last word was simply "Don't."
AAD00105828	A hostage crisis between the NCR and Great Khans was resolved peacefully when a third-party negotiator successfully secured the hostages' release.
AAD00105829	A group of Great Khans were killed in a bloody end to a hostage crisis in Boulder City. It's not currently known why the Khans were in the area.
AAD00105830	A few Great Khans are on the loose after an aborted standoff left at least two NCR hostages dead. The NCR is offering a reward for their capture.
AAD00105831	NCR has failed to retake the prison it recently lost in a deadly riot. Powder Gang operations against the NCR are expected to continue.
AAD00105832	Beef prices around the New Vegas Strip have dropped significantly following an agreement between the Ultra-Luxe and Brahmin baron Heck Gunderson.
AAD00105833	I think it's time to knock you down a peg or two, Ranger.
AAD00105834	We'll see about that.
AAD00105835	You've got five seconds to get out of my sight before I shove that rifle where the sun don't shine.
AAD00105836	Son of a bitch!
AAD00105837	The name's &PCName;.
AAD00105838	Is that so? Can't say I've ever heard a good word about you. Lots of bad ones, though.
AAD00105839	So why don't you just turn your butt around and scoot back down the road before I blast some daylight through you?
AAD00105840	< Barter 50 >
AAD00105841	[SUCCEEDED] That should work. We'll do a weighted exchange based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
AAD00105842	Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
AAD00105843	McCarran is overstocked with water and fresh vegetables. Arrange for a two for one trade.
AAD00105844	McCarran has plenty of caps to cover the shipment. They'll deal with the cost.
AAD00105845	Excellent. We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
AAD00105846	McCarran needs a regular shipment of brahmin meat and spices for the mess hall.
AAD00105847	Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from the local Brahmin ranchers.
AAD00105848	The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat will cost some serious caps.
AAD00105849	Some of those could be combined with other chemicals to make drugs...
AAD00105850	Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
AAD00105851	Combining those with chemical cleaners would yield strong chems...
AAD00105852	Really? Huh, never thought of that. The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
AAD00105853	Contreras sent me for some medical supplies.
AAD00105854	Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
AAD00105855	Are work contracts common for the Crimson Caravan Company?
AAD00105856	Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
AAD00105857	The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep and expenses are deducted, of course.
AAD00105858	Janet's asked me to talk to you about releasing her from her contract.
AAD00105859	Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
AAD00105860	She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
AAD00105861	Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
AAD00105862	My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.
AAD00105863	RNVNewsStoryLine2
AAD00105864	No suspects have been identified, but seniors are advised to be on the lookout for the so-called Denture Killer.
AAD00105865	Where would you suggest I find meat in the amount you'd need here?
AAD00105866	It doesn't need to all come from the same source. There are a bunch of different vendors around who sell meat. Fitz, the Nashes, Crimson Caravan...
AAD00105867	We've never really tried to go out and organize deals with merchants to supply our food. Already having an overstock of food, we haven't needed to.
AAD00105868	But we really need some good-old red meat on the menu soon, so I'm willing to divert some caps in their direction if they're open to supplying us.
AAD00105869	Sign me up.
AAD00105870	Good. We clear out the hostages, they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
AAD00105871	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
AAD00105872	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging these boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
AAD00105873	[Psycho] Funny you should mention Psycho. I actually have a few dozen doses on me...
AAD00105874	All right, I have to admit I wasn't expecting you to say that. I was just joking. But if it makes you feel any better, I'm impressed.
AAD00105875	So anyway, how about those hostages?
AAD00105876	These ten caps are yours if you point me to anyone you've seen with a weird old gun.
AAD00105877	Blaaagghhh.
AAD00105878	I would bribe you, but I don't have much on me. Would you accept an IOU?
AAD00105879	I'm looking for someone carrying an antique gun.
AAD00105880	Friend, not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
AAD00105881	If you cover the area methodically, I'm quite certain you'll happen upon them with only the most insubstantial of delays.
AAD00105882	Be well. And do try and avoid the tragic path of the sot that led me to my present infirmities and spiritual woes.
AAD00105883	I don't have the caps.
AAD00105884	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
AAD00105885	Here's the caps.
AAD00105886	All right. Sit still and let me work.
AAD00105887	Could you remind me where I should look for supplies?
AAD00105888	What do you need to know?
AAD00105889	I worked out a deal where the Brotherhood will help the NCR defend the dam.
AAD00105890	And why would you have done that?
AAD00105891	Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving them a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
AAD00105892	Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
AAD00105893	Where do you think Benny's gone?
AAD00105894	His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
AAD00105895	It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
AAD00105896	I'd like to ask some questions first...
AAD00105897	There will be time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
AAD00105898	Goodbye.
AAD00105899	By "goodbye," I assume you mean that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
AAD00105900	Why do you care whether Kimball lives or dies?
AAD00105901	Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
AAD00105902	If I compel the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
AAD00105903	In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
AAD00105904	So why don't you want the NCR President to die?
AAD00105905	You recruited the Omertas as one of the Three Families?
AAD00105906	Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
AAD00105907	They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
AAD00105908	They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
AAD00105909	They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
AAD00105910	The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
AAD00105911	As for the White Glove Society, I'm afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
AAD00105912	What were the original names of the other tribes?
AAD00105913	Tell me about the Boomers.
AAD00105914	They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
AAD00105915	Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
AAD00105916	Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
AAD00105917	Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
AAD00105918	You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
AAD00105919	The Boomers sound dangerous.
AAD00105920	Yeah, but your heavy use has really depreciated its value. It's only worth twenty caps now.
AAD00105921	Aw, man. It's Stacey's fault. She pretends like she didn't get hit.
AAD00105922	That's still a lot of money. I guess I'll take it.
AAD00105923	It's worth 1000 caps to me.
AAD00105924	You mean it? Wow, thanks!
AAD00105925	I bet me and Stacey can get something real cool at Mick and Ralph's with that.
AAD00105926	I'm a space soldier. The general sent me to ask you to borrow your gun to stop an alien invasion.
AAD00105927	Really? Cool! Bring it back to me when you're done, okay? I think Stacey might be turning into an alien.
AAD00105928	Give me that gun.
AAD00105929	Sorry, but I need to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
AAD00105930	No charge, just helping out.
AAD00105931	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip cat.
AAD00105932	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip kitten.
AAD00105933	How about a little pick-me-up?
AAD00105934	Here you go, this'll give you some zing.
AAD00105935	Some caps would be nice.
AAD00105936	Here's a little tink-tink to weight your pockets.
AAD00105937	I changed my mind about helping you with your Legion problem. I'm in.
AAD00105938	Good. We clear out the hostages, they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
AAD00105939	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
AAD00105940	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging these boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
AAD00105941	The rangefinder might be a problem. I reactivated HELIOS One, and it's not powering a weapon.
AAD00105942	Ah, hell. Well, how could you know, right? Okay. Two other options still on the table.
AAD00105943	<Draw Weapon> Well, you're never going to find out.
AAD00105944	You don't have a say. Go back in your cave.
AAD00105945	A paladin always has a say where the Codex is concerned. Veronica's aspirations are seditious.
AAD00105946	All of us are sworn to obey and protect the Codex, even against one of our own. She's gone too far this time.
AAD00105947	All right, here you go.
AAD00105948	Come back by here when you're done at the tables.
AAD00105949	Let's see what you have.
AAD00105950	The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count on me, friend.
AAD00105951	Not interested. Maybe some other time.
AAD00105952	Bring on the mayhem, friend.
AAD00105953	Goodbye.
AAD00105954	Goodbye.
AAD00105955	Good day to you, and stay out of trouble.
AAD00105956	Uh... Veronica just said those things to test you. She didn't mean it.
AAD00105957	[FAILED] You're pathetic. Hide behind words all you like, but your cowardice shows through.
AAD00105958	Ideals are strengthened by the challenges they endure. Veronica's questioning did you a service.
AAD00105959	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmph. She'd be doing a greater service by carrying out her duties and not trying to undermine the elder's authority.
AAD00105960	This had better be the last time her loyalty falters. You've been warned.
AAD00105961	Who is Father Elijah?
AAD00105962	He was our Elder when we came East. A wizard with technology, really. His mind just worked that way naturally. Learned a lot from him.
AAD00105963	But he started having disagreements with the other Elders. The Brotherhood's interest is in old technology. He wanted to explore developing new tech.
AAD00105964	And there were other ways he wanted to push. Other weapons. Ones with ethics questions attached. Rather than deal with him, they sent him East.
AAD00105965	How do you feel about the other members?
AAD00105966	I called them family before. That's not far off. Both the good and the bad. It's like a big unending family reunion in that bunker.
AAD00105967	There's people you love, people you'll never speak to again, and it's always awkward when you run into someone you used to date.
AAD00105968	Does the Brotherhood protect people from raiders or other threats?
AAD00105969	No, no. We only protect people from themselves, and only in the sense that we don't let them have the really good Pre-War toys.
AAD00105970	And sometimes it's more like we protect ourselves from them and hope to outlive them and become humanity's sole heirs.
AAD00105971	We've had people go rogue, though, and start helping people. One chapter had a small civil war over it. We take our isolationism seriously.
AAD00105972	What's the Codex?
AAD00105973	Ah, the Codex. If it's in there, we have to abide it, if it's not, it's not important.
AAD00105974	It documents our history, too. Part of what Scribes like me do is update it. Hmm... I wonder...
AAD00105975	Nah, they'd probably catch it if I rewrote the Founder's axioms.
AAD00105976	Do you like being a member?
AAD00105977	I know sometimes I sound like I don't. I know. But there's something that still rings true to me about our code.
AAD00105978	There's an honor to it. We're protecting people. Even if it's from themselves, it's a good cause.
AAD00105979	We just lose sight of the big picture sometimes. Treat all our practices with the same sacredness.
AAD00105980	What do you do for them?
AAD00105981	I'm a procurement specialist. Like I said, it's basically grocery shopping. Except sometimes the groceries are scavenged parts and arcane technology.
AAD00105982	The elder who brought us to the Mojave, Father Elijah, usually had me looking for these old memory units. But he'd never tell me what they were for.
AAD00105983	Nowadays I'm usually sent to do business with traders at places like the 188. But sometimes I think it's just to keep me out of everyone's hair.
AAD00105984	How did you get to be a member?
AAD00105985	More sexual favors than I can even count. I am still tired from it.
AAD00105986	No, actually, you're born into it. My parents, their parents, so on. When you're young you can choose to leave. But it's home, so most people don't.
AAD00105987	We don't take on new members, really. You can do the math on our long-term prospects based on that point. I keep hoping we'll change that.
AAD00105988	What's their purpose?
AAD00105989	Ha! Good question. These days it's hard to say. Once upon a time it was about technology. Controlling it so it couldn't destroy us again.
AAD00105990	Energy weapons and power armor are usually tops on our list, although I appreciate anything that's vintage.
AAD00105991	But that all seems so limited now. We haven't grown or adapted. And now we're stuck in a hole, not carrying out our mission.
AAD00105992	Vouch for me? How?
AAD00105993	CraigBooneVictimSpeechFail
AAD00105994	No confession? No evidence? What good is that?
AAD00105995	It was the, uh... the shifty eyes. Yeah. Dead give-away.
AAD00105996	Try to throw me out and you'll be leaving - in pieces.
AAD00105997	Jesus Christ!
AAD00105998	< Speech 30 >
AAD00105999	[SUCCEEDED] We were on patrol near the Dam when a Legion raiding party jumped us. Didn't even have time to radio it in.
AAD00106000	I was hit in the head with a machete and knocked out. Didn't kill me, though some nights I wish it had. When I woke up, my nerve was gone.
AAD00106001	The rest of my squad was crucified, butchered, mutilated. I don't know how they missed me. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew they'd broken me.
AAD00106002	I gambled and drank a lot after that. Got into trouble, but the Rangers gave me a second chance instead of kicking me out. So, here I am.
AAD00106003	If you don't tell me, someone else will. I'd rather hear your version.
AAD00106004	I need to confirm your report about Great Khans with trained Deathclaws.
AAD00106005	You must be mistaken - I haven't filed any report like that. Trained Deathclaws? I would have remembered that.
AAD00106006	If someone is saying I filed that report, that's a load of crap. I won't have my name attached to a clerical error.
AAD00106007	There's no way the White Glove Society will be cannibals again - I've already seen to that.
AAD00106008	You've been resourceful in the past. Why are you a failure now?
AAD00106009	You'd best step up your performance with this next assignment...
AAD00106010	The White Glove Society has agreed to an alliance with Caesar's Legion.
AAD00106011	Good. It will be valuable to have allies on the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken. Now, as for your next assignment...
AAD00106012	The cannibals among the White Glove Society are dead.
AAD00106013	They'll be of no use to my Legion, then.
AAD00106014	You squandered a potentially valuable resource. Do better with your next assignment or there will be trouble...
AAD00106015	The Boomers hate me. They'll never follow my lead.
AAD00106016	Then you'll have to be extraordinarily persuasive. Or kill them - their leaders, at least.
AAD00106017	Get to it, will you? You're wasting my time.
AAD00106018	Why must Mr. House be killed?
AAD00106019	Because he complicates the equation of force. He's a free agent, an unpredictable element.
AAD00106020	I'm sure he's trying to sit out this battle, just as he did four years ago, hoping the Legion and the Profligates will wipe each other out.
AAD00106021	When he sees the Profligates losing this battle, however, he might throw his support behind them. Except he won't, because he'll be dead.
AAD00106022	What should I expect at the dam?
AAD00106023	Lanius will be waiting for you. Your arrival will signal to him that it's time to launch the attack.
AAD00106024	As for what to expect, it's going to be the greatest battle - and victory - mankind has seen since it almost wiped itself off the face of the Earth.
AAD00106025	Tactically, it's simple - kill and kill some more. I may have a few surprises in store for the NCR, but that won't concern you.
AAD00106026	Tell me about Vulpes Inculta.
AAD00106027	Vulpes is the best of my Frumentarii. A remarkable individual from an unremarkable tribe south of the Utah.
AAD00106028	He was brought into the Legion as a boy, survived training, fought well enough as a Legionary to be promoted to the rank of Decanus.
AAD00106029	Then, in battle against an unimportant tribe, he broke ranks and led his contubernium through a hole in their defenses to capture its chieftain.
AAD00106030	Well, his Centurion wanted him crucified for disobedience. So I made him a Frumentarii.
AAD00106031	I've heard rumors of your legate, Lanius. What's his story?
AAD00106032	He killed fifteen before they brought him down. He didn't die, obviously.
AAD00106033	I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of his face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
AAD00106034	When he did, I went to his bedside and showed him the helmet I'd had forged to cover his face. I said he could have it if he'd fight for me.
AAD00106035	He accepted... on condition that he be allowed to kill the surviving males of his tribe. I said, make it the adult males and you have a deal.
AAD00106036	What happened when Lanius attacked his own tribe?
AAD00106037	And I've heard it's a bad idea to tempt the wrath of Caesar. Change the subject.
AAD00106038	I've heard the commander of the first battle was called "The Burned Man."
AAD00106039	What's your opinion of President Kimball?
AAD00106040	A man of potential, held back by the craven political context he inhabits. You realize he was a general? "The Hero of the Mojave," they called him.
AAD00106041	A title he earned by extirpating lesser tribes that dared attack NCR citizens. His responses were swift and draconian.
AAD00106042	President Tandi, the "founding mother," coddled hostile tribes... but her successors were less naive, so they gave Kimball free rein.
AAD00106043	And after a respectable military career, what does he do? Become a politician.
AAD00106044	But he did so by election. What better way to stunt the growth of leaders, not to mention whole cultures?
AAD00106045	A leader shouldn't have to kowtow to those who serve him. With so much energy wasted on those below, how is he ever to move forward?
AAD00106046	Had he taken the government by force, used his army to stage a coup, things would be very different.
AAD00106047	I'll just have to do it for him.
AAD00106048	Isn't it natural for someone like Kimball to seek greater power?
AAD00106049	It'll frighten them. If I can reach out and kill whomever I choose, then they know the only reason they're alive is I haven't tried yet.
AAD00106050	You have to understand that Kimball is a symbol. Without him, there would be no NCR occupation of the Mojave.
AAD00106051	He mustered the troops - as many as his senate would allow - and sent them in. All the right reasons, done all the wrong ways.
AAD00106052	Any invasion by a democracy is a half-measure. When Kimball dies, the NCR will recoil from the Mojave, and from his legacy.
AAD00106053	By the time they recover and try to strike back, I'll be invading them.
AAD00106054	How will the NCR react to Kimball's death? Won't it just anger them?
AAD00106055	What do you think of the Brotherhood of Steel?
AAD00106056	The worst impulses of mankind, concentrated in one insane, backward tribe.
AAD00106057	The Brotherhood seems to have formed not long after the great atomic war. It's hard to know - they care little for history.
AAD00106058	Some of the Brotherhood scribes we captured further East didn't even know the name of their founder, Roger Maxson.
AAD00106059	They like to pretty up their mission with trappings of chivalry, but the truth is they're hoarders. They hoard technology.
AAD00106060	It's been 200 years, and they still have the mentality of scavengers. They say they're preserving these technologies, but for what?
AAD00106061	They have no vision. They offer no future. They're a dead end.
AAD00106062	<INERT NODE TO HOLD LINES FOR HOW PLAYER HAS TROUBLED NCR.>
AAD00106063	Silus, the Centurion who let himself get captured, died at McCarran before he could reveal sensitive information.
AAD00106064	Chief Hanlon, a nemesis of my Legion, died the humiliating death he deserved.
AAD00106065	In Boulder City, you let the renegade Khans go free, but left NCR troopers gurgling on the ground, drowning in their own blood.
AAD00106066	<Inert Node to hold lines for how player has troubled Legion.>
AAD00106067	Vulpes Inculta, the best of my frumentarii, is dead.
AAD00106068	All the bribes I sent to the Omertas ended up buying me nothing.
AAD00106069	That I'd decorate this tent with your guts.
AAD00106070	Praetorians, to me!
AAD00106071	Death to tyrants! <Start combat.>
AAD00106072	Praetorians, to arms!
AAD00106073	Mr. House sent me to infiltrate your camp.
AAD00106074	Mission accomplished, asshole. I never would've suspected a thing if you hadn't told me - but now I'll have to have you killed.
AAD00106075	Have you heard anything unusual about any of the other Ranger stations?
AAD00106076	Nothing as severe. Charlie seems to be getting a lot of extra medical supplies for some reason, while Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in a while.
AAD00106077	Echo has been reporting heavy Legion activity down on their end, but that's about it.
AAD00106078	Good thing you're wearing a skirt, makes pissing yourself go easier. <Attack.>
AAD00106079	Brothers, help!
AAD00106080	I came seeking yours, skirt boy. <Attack.>
AAD00106081	Brothers, help!
AAD00106082	You just messed with the wrong gal. <Attack.>
AAD00106083	Brothers! Attack!
AAD00106084	You just messed with the wrong guy. <Attack.>
AAD00106085	Brothers! Attack!
AAD00106086	Can you tell me where Troike is?
AAD00106087	Troike spends all his days down in Zoara on the lower level.
AAD00106088	Troike is dead, but I'm sure you know that.
AAD00106089	Do you know someone named Clanden?
AAD00106090	Yeah. I know him. You'll probably find him in his room upstairs. He usually just sends down for girls or food.
AAD00106091	I'm leaving you here.
AAD00106092	Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll put me on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
AAD00106093	VDialogueBennyFreedAmbush
AAD00106094	Thanks for getting me outta there! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
AAD00106095	How ya like being Mister Goody-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
AAD00106096	How ya like being Miss Goody-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
AAD00106097	What if I helped you escape?
AAD00106098	Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes, every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
AAD00106099	Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
AAD00106100	< Speech - 45 >
AAD00106101	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe I'm doing this, but all right, the hostages can go. The NCR had better keep their end of the deal, though.
AAD00106102	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
AAD00106103	Free the hostages now, and I'll have the NCR escort you out of their territory.
AAD00106104	What about you?
AAD00106105	I'm not one for running a business. Never really had a head for numbers or smooth-talk. My talents are a little more... direct.
AAD00106106	Mama always said that was my gift. When we were kids, the others used to fight over and steal one another's toys. I always broke mine.
AAD00106107	And if the others messed with me, I broke theirs too. Sometimes I'd break them even if they were nice to me, just to show them what's what.
AAD00106108	One day mama took me aside and said, "Boy, you're never going to go very far, but you're going to make a whole lotta people come up short."
AAD00106109	Why don't you just shoot your way out of here?
AAD00106110	I'm not afraid of a gunfight, but I'd rather get back to Red Rock without a few extra holes in me if I can help it.
AAD00106111	How did you end up joining the Legion?
AAD00106112	When the Legion showed up, we fought, most tribes did. Hangdogs hung out longer than most... broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
AAD00106113	So we gave up, our elders couldn't bear the idea of our spirit animals burning in the afterlife.
AAD00106114	Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
AAD00106115	Can I go in?
AAD00106116	Well, I don't know. Depends on if you can make it worth my time. A hundred caps sounds right to me.
AAD00106117	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
AAD00106118	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
AAD00106119	Do you know Doc Mitchell?
AAD00106120	You mean Mitch? It's been ages since I've heard the name. My sister and I used to call him "Mole-butt." Don't ask.
AAD00106121	That was a long time ago, before we exchanged the warmth of our home for the thin air of the Wasteland.
AAD00106122	You know Doc Mitchell?
AAD00106123	Mitch!? You mean "mole-butt?"
AAD00106124	I hadn't thought about that name in a long time. I was just a child, and... he had a big mole in his rear bumper.
AAD00106125	You understand, kids and all that. Everyone knows about each other in a Vault, there's no other way. I hope mol... I mean Mitch, is doing well!
AAD00106126	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
AAD00106127	You're kicking me into gear, huh? Well, I think I'll drive my chassis over to your pad. Wait for me down there and, don't forget the oil.
AAD00106128	I have no money for your toll. Surely you will let a fair traveler pass through your gate.
AAD00106129	Very well, traveller. You may pass.
AAD00106130	You don't need toys. I bet you can get a fun game of Boomers and targets.
AAD00106131	Yeah, it looks great.
AAD00106132	But you're probably here for more of my special commodity, and luckily for you, I haven't been idle since we last spoke.
AAD00106133	However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 100 a tip, now. You game?
AAD00106134	
AAD00106135	I've heard here and there that the word "Hope" has recently become quite popular with the Squatters.
AAD00106136	But that's all I've heard. If I knew more, I'd try to bilk you out of more caps. You interested in one of my other tips?
AAD00106137	What's with the snowglobe collection?
AAD00106138	Not many people know this, but Mr. House is one of the world's biggest collectors of antique snow globes!
AAD00106139	If you happen to find any out in the Wasteland, you can bring them to me and I'll add them to his collection! You'll get a reward, of course.
AAD00106140	In fact, one of Mr. House's favorites went missing when we moved the collection. If you have a look around the Lucky 38, you might even find it!
AAD00106141	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take it and put it with the rest of the collection.
AAD00106142	I've got a snowglobe for Mr. House's collection.
AAD00106143	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take them and put them with the rest of the collection.
AAD00106144	I've got some snowglobes for Mr. House's collection.
AAD00106145	What kind of robots are you?
AAD00106146	Why, I'm a RobCo PDQ-88b Mk I Securitron, you silly goose! We're the finest in personal or civil robotic security on the market!
AAD00106147	What's the goal?
AAD00106148	Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
AAD00106149	The override will enable me to control the entire dam's power output.
AAD00106150	You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
AAD00106151	You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
AAD00106152	As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready to perform this task?
AAD00106153	What more could I have done?
AAD00106154	You could have succeeded!
AAD00106155	Where was I supposed to meet Price, again?
AAD00106156	Pawn shop in Westside called Miguel's. It's in Outer Vegas, northwest of the Strip.
AAD00106157	Blake is where, exactly?
AAD00106158	The Crimson Caravan is up north past the Gun Runners. During the day Blake is usually in their main office.
AAD00106159	Remind me where Isaac is.
AAD00106160	The Gun Runners are almost straight north of here. A little east. Isaac has a house in their compound.
AAD00106161	I'm going to pollute the ventilation system with the stinking corpse of an NCR private.
AAD00106162	VFreeformMcCarranCorpseGuardEnd
AAD00106163	Oh my God, are you okay? You've gotta get to a medic. Doc Kemp can patch you up back at base.
AAD00106164	How could you just sacrifice your body like that? You never even met him. If the NCR doesn't have a medal for this, they should make one up.
AAD00106165	What's your reason for staying?
AAD00106166	The location by the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
AAD00106167	Me, I like having big walls between myself and the wasteland.
AAD00106168	Why are you "sort of" the doctor?
AAD00106169	I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training than any of the other guys here.
AAD00106170	It also gives me an excuse to stay out of any raiding parties. The gang can't lose its only doctor now, can it?
AAD00106171	I need a doctor.
AAD00106172	I've seen worse.
AAD00106173	Life can be pretty rough sometimes.
AAD00106174	The fact that you're still on your feet is... surprising.
AAD00106175	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
AAD00106176	Hell, it's all dangerous. Know why? Because you can't trust anything that stands on two legs.
AAD00106177	If you're looking for real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
AAD00106178	If you're looking for real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
AAD00106179	Chavez has been dealt with. You won't see him around here anymore.
AAD00106180	I'm happy you cleared that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
AAD00106181	Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if not, take him out.
AAD00106182	VMS29KingOfferStart
AAD00106183	Okay, I need some answers, now. These guys just barged in here and said they were under orders to keep me here until you arrived.
AAD00106184	I'm about five seconds away from telling my men to take 'em down, so speak fast.
AAD00106185	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about the situation with the Kings in Freeside.
AAD00106186	VDialogueMrHouseSecuritronUpgrade
AAD00106187	Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly against soft targets at medium range...
AAD00106188	All of this, you probably already knew...
AAD00106189	Freeside's problems are too big for you to have much impact.
AAD00106190	Oh yeah, I heard some new things that you might find interesting. I'm going to have to start charging 100 caps per tip, though.
AAD00106191	After all, I have to save up for my ticket out of here, right? So how about it? Want a tip?
AAD00106192	Now you'll get some respect. You should give some hell to the people that used to push you around.
AAD00106193	Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. They'll learn that they shouldn't have messed with me. Just wait till they get what's coming to them!
AAD00106194	What do I do when I'm at the train?
AAD00106195	Put the bomb in one of the vents inside the train on the back wall, towards the joint that connects the cars. Arm it, and get out of there.
AAD00106196	I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of Private Crenshaw.
AAD00106197	Crenshaw's a problem child. Lots of run-ins with his superiors. It'll be easy for them to believe he's working for the Legion.
AAD00106198	I'm trying to get to the Strip. Know anything that could help me out?
AAD00106199	You're looking to get past those tin cans at the gate, right? They let people by all the time, if they've got the caps.
AAD00106200	But if you're not rich, and I can tell you ain't, the King might be able to help you out, provided he likes you.
AAD00106201	Tell me about Dermot, your partner.
AAD00106202	What do you even mean? He's Dermot.
AAD00106203	Dermot knows how to work salvage better than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
AAD00106204	I know what you and your partner have been up to - I got the evidence from your rooms.
AAD00106205	You're right about that. Saint James! Got a thief here!
AAD00106206	<200 caps> Let's do it.
AAD00106207	Oh, we will, sugar. We will.
AAD00106208	I'll do my best to live up to my last performance.
AAD00106209	How much for your services?
AAD00106210	A pittance, sugar - and I'll leave you without a care in the world.
AAD00106211	Same price as before, sugar, and the same fun, too.
AAD00106212	Sounds like life in the Legion is tough.
AAD00106213	You don't know much about the Legion, do you? Women are like money, given as rewards, breeding stock. Liking boys is bad for the economy.
AAD00106214	Honestly, as long as men meet obligations and the child count, "friendships" are a sight more equal than the level of most Legion husbands and wives.
AAD00106215	I hear you were a slave of Caesar's Legion.
AAD00106216	What Marco said is true. The Legion attacked my village when I was 16.
AAD00106217	My parents were killed as examples. The rest of us, chained and dragged to some kind of camp. A Centurion there chose me as his tent servant.
AAD00106218	He was handsome, and gentle, most of the time. Said it was our secret, and he'd protect me. Gave me little gifts, stupid things.
AAD00106219	But Caesar punishes homosexuality with death, and we nearly got caught, and there were suspicions. So when he took me out into the desert...
AAD00106220	Well, I knew he was going to get rid of me. So I kicked him where it counts and I ran. And then swam. And ran some more. Wound up here.
AAD00106221	Baby, who I am doesn't matter. I'll be anybody you need me to be. It's better that way, you'll see.
AAD00106222	Tell me about yourself.
AAD00106223	I'm just a fantasy come to life. But you already knew that.
AAD00106224	Tell me about yourself.
AAD00106225	No thanks.
AAD00106226	Fine by me. You the one missing out on all the exciting details.
AAD00106227	<300 caps> Here's your money.
AAD00106228	Get ready, honey. I'm going to make it good for you.
AAD00106229	Let me help you slip into something a little more comfortable.
AAD00106230	I'm going to make your toes curl, baby.
AAD00106231	So get on the bed already. I got something to show you.
AAD00106232	How much does it cost to hire you?
AAD00106233	It's worth every cap, baby. I'll do things to you you didn't even think was possible, and leave you feeling like everything's right in the world.
AAD00106234	I'm not surprised. Whip out your caps and away we go.
AAD00106235	I'd like your services.
AAD00106236	Wouldn't you make more money working on the Strip?
AAD00106237	I got my start at the Gomorrah. Good money, but I saw how those Omertas hook girls on free Jet or Med-X - then start charging.
AAD00106238	Slavery through a needle is what that is. I earn less out here, but I keep more.
AAD00106239	Tell me about yourself.
AAD00106240	I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll ever find anywhere outside of the Strip.
AAD00106241	Take a look at this ledger I found in Dermot's room.
AAD00106242	I'll take a look, but you better have a good reason for asking me to violate his privacy.
AAD00106243	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
AAD00106244	I've seen enough. They're done for, both of them.
AAD00106245	You might be interested to know that I killed a Fiend named Cook-Cook.
AAD00106246	I'm interested in learning more about Dermot and Saint James.
AAD00106247	They don't look like much, but they earn a pretty good living by selling scrap and salvage.
AAD00106248	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
AAD00106249	Tell me about Sweetie.
AAD00106250	Oh, I know everything - how she smells, how she tastes, how it feels to slip her on and wiggle.
AAD00106251	Damn fine woman, but damn expensive, too. Just ask Saint James - he spends near every cap he gets on Sweetie's sweets.
AAD00106252	What do you know about Dermot and Saint James?
AAD00106253	Those boys been living here a while now. They sell salvage and do all right. I never been with either of them.
AAD00106254	That Saint James is all over Sweetie every time he rustles up the caps to afford her. She says he's peculiar, but who isn't?
AAD00106255	Is this apartment building yours?
AAD00106256	Yep, for years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
AAD00106257	Folks who can't pay their way onto the Strip need a place to stay, too. And when Pretty Sarah set her whores up here, the Casa went full-service.
AAD00106258	<75 caps> What the hell. Let's do it.
AAD00106259	You won't notice anything once the lights are out, hon. The places that count are still firm enough...
AAD00106260	Well, don't just stand there. I ain't getting any younger.
AAD00106261	I'd like your services.
AAD00106262	Best prices around so long as you don't try putting anything someplace it was never intended. How's that sound?
AAD00106263	I had questions about your tenants.
AAD00106264	Like who?
AAD00106265	[Continue]
AAD00106266	But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
AAD00106267	That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran Legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
AAD00106268	That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
AAD00106269	Why are the rangers here?
AAD00106270	There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
AAD00106271	Nevada had its own posse, the Desert Rangers. They fought Caesar even farther east, out in Arizona.
AAD00106272	Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
AAD00106273	Why do they call Lanius the Monster of the East?
AAD00106274	Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops people's heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
AAD00106275	Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
AAD00106276	But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
AAD00106277	Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
AAD00106278	Is Moore in charge of all the NCR troopers out here?
AAD00106279	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
AAD00106280	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
AAD00106281	Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
AAD00106282	Colonel Moore's "way"?
AAD00106283	The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
AAD00106284	Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be a ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
AAD00106285	She's better at making graves than making friends. Bring in Moore and the earth will be razed. Fields will be salted.
AAD00106286	Tell me about General Oliver.
AAD00106287	Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
AAD00106288	Maybe it's best that I just say he's a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
AAD00106289	Doesn't matter. Your time's up, Hanlon.
AAD00106290	Well, you got that right.
AAD00106291	Caesar is sick. Like... really sick. He could drop any day.
AAD00106292	Caesar's sick. He won't live long. The Legion will fall apart a few years after he's gone.
AAD00106293	Caesar's dead. The Legion can't hold itself together for five years, much less ten.
AAD00106294	It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
AAD00106295	For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess that I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
AAD00106296	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
AAD00106297	What will you do if I don't turn you in?
AAD00106298	Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted us on the ridge.
AAD00106299	He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
AAD00106300	If the troopers fall back, and they will, the rangers will advance to cover Oliver's retreat. We lose the dam, Oliver and the senate are ruined.
AAD00106301	Aren't you fighting for the people of New Vegas?
AAD00106302	We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the Families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
AAD00106303	They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
AAD00106304	Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the Families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
AAD00106305	Do you ever stop talking?
AAD00106306	I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
AAD00106307	I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for war out there.
AAD00106308	How is NCR doing?
AAD00106309	It's no secret we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
AAD00106310	We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
AAD00106311	NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down at Baja.
AAD00106312	< Speech 30 >
AAD00106313	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Pickings were getting slim around here anyway.
AAD00106314	Eddie's just going to keep chasing you. Quit while you're ahead... and alive.
AAD00106315	< Cock your head and grin. >
AAD00106316	Run!
AAD00106317	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
AAD00106318	Let's finish this, then.
AAD00106319	Avenge Caesar!
AAD00106320	< Medicine 50 >
AAD00106321	[FAILED] It's obvious you know as little about medicine as I do. Spare me your excuses.
AAD00106322	There was, uh, internal bleeding and lesions and other problems.
AAD00106323	< Speech 50 >
AAD00106324	[FAILED] Save your excuses.
AAD00106325	Hey, it totally wasn't my fault that he died. He was old.
AAD00106326	vHDNCRBattleAdvance
AAD00106327	What? You think this is my fault?
AAD00106328	His head exploded, idiot. Of course it's your fault. Avenge Caesar!
AAD00106329	What do you know about Legate Lanius?
AAD00106330	The Legate is not a man to be crossed, especially if you're a woman. That's all I'll talk about it.
AAD00106331	I did all I could to save him.
AAD00106332	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
AAD00106333	<Lie> I did all I could to save him.
AAD00106334	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
AAD00106335	[Speech Check]
AAD00106336	[SUCCEEDED] Damn it all to hell! Let's go!
AAD00106337	<Lie> Colonel Moore is in trouble! She needs help now!
AAD00106338	[FAILED] Our instructions were pretty clear. Now you better get your ass out of here.
AAD00106339	Don't you have anything better to do right now than guard this door?
AAD00106340	Tell me about the Burned Man.
AAD00106341	The Burned Man was Caesar's advisor and general when the Legion was originally formed. The Burned Man led us to a disastrous defeat at the Dam.
AAD00106342	On Caesar's orders, the Burned Man was covered in pitch by the Praetorian Guard, lit on fire, and cast into the Grand Canyon.
AAD00106343	Caesar has forbidden us from ever speaking his true name again, and so we simply refer to him as the Burned Man.
AAD00106344	Tell me about the Legate.
AAD00106345	He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of a man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
AAD00106346	He killed one of my pack Brahmin simply because it was in his way. I knew better than to complain about it, though.
AAD00106347	It took some doing, but I convinced the White Glove Society to support Caesar's Legion.
AAD00106348	You did? That's... well, that's an unusual approach!
AAD00106349	But I know it makes sense somehow if you're the one doing it! The problem is me!
AAD00106350	I helped the Omertas perfect their plan to slaughter everyone on the Strip.
AAD00106351	You'd think it'd be bad for the Strip but... I guess it must be good!
AAD00106352	Yeah - take the Strip down a notch or two, right? That'll show it! Okay!
AAD00106353	Tell me what you know about the Great Khans.
AAD00106354	They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed!
AAD00106355	So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them!
AAD00106356	So then they settled at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!
AAD00106357	How have the Khans been kicked around?
AAD00106358	Which tribes should I "get to know"?
AAD00106359	There's a bunch! Some of them you've already met - like the Chairmen, for instance!
AAD00106360	I think you should visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
AAD00106361	And there are some important groups farther from the Strip, too, like the Boomers, the Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of Steel!
AAD00106362	What evidence do you have that Mr. House will make a move?
AAD00106363	We've had reported sightings of Mr. House's Securitrons spying on both NCR and Legion forces.
AAD00106364	Also, given a recent analysis of the sightings, we now estimate that Mr. House has at least four times as many Securitrons as previously assumed.
AAD00106365	He wouldn't show his hand like that if he weren't prepared to move. And neither the NCR or Legion can spare the troops to investigate.
AAD00106366	Which is why I'm sending you. Any other questions?
AAD00106367	Sounds like you miss it.
AAD00106368	I do, sometimes. There are days I'd give anything to be out in the open air, planting explosives and laying down covering fire.
AAD00106369	But here I am, stuck in the same stale office day after day, while other people get to do the actual fighting.
AAD00106370	But enough reminiscing. Do you have other questions?
AAD00106371	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
AAD00106372	It's a position of some strategic importance to the NCR, providing power and water as it does.
AAD00106373	It's moderately defensible, with a single point of entry on the east side. To get to the power plants below, the enemy has to cross the entire top.
AAD00106374	The Legion's tried to cross the water on a few occasions, but slow-moving boats make easy targets for sharpshooters.
AAD00106375	Yeah, let's play again.
AAD00106376	Okay, hope you're ready to lose.
AAD00106377	CaravanPlayerWins
AAD00106378	Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
AAD00106379	Want to play a hand of Caravan?
AAD00106380	A fellow enthusiast, huh? That's great! Let's play.
AAD00106381	Sure. Old No-bark is always looking to play. Not for entertainment, mind you, but because if you look at the cards right you can know the future.
AAD00106382	What happened to the Legion?
AAD00106383	With their leader dead, the rest of their army retreated to the east. We've sent scouts to track them, but that's it.
AAD00106384	We don't have the forces or supplies necessary to chase them down. More's the pity.
AAD00106385	Still, I've sent a few skilled men out to make sure their journey is "eventful". It should be a long time before they even think of returning.
AAD00106386	Do you have any work for me?
AAD00106387	I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you. There's much to be done, but nothing for someone with your skills.
AAD00106388	You should take some time off. You've earned it.
AAD00106389	How have things been since the battle?
AAD00106390	Surprisingly good. Our forces have managed to secure the region with little resistance, and trade should soon reach an all-time high.
AAD00106391	The brass was particularly surprised by the lack of domestic threats in the area. They were prepared to spend months pacifying known troublemakers.
AAD00106392	When they found those threats absent, they turned to the man in charge of the area, but Hsu being Hsu, he denied having anything to do with it.
AAD00106393	So now the men have to answer to Brigadier General Moore, and both they and I have you to thank for it.
AAD00106394	We made a good team. I hope we can work together again in the future.
AAD00106395	The Chip was supposed to activate an army of Securitrons at the Fort, but I blew it up.
AAD00106396	You... blew it up? That's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
AAD00106397	I really admire how you stack the odds against yourself! Yeah, make things challenging!
AAD00106398	It's great. Really. Yeah. So, anyway...
AAD00106399	The Platinum Chip upgrades the Securitrons - and there's a whole army of them under the Fort.
AAD00106400	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
AAD00106401	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - I'm gonna say anybody!
AAD00106402	I don't have the Platinum Chip. Maybe it's on Benny's corpse.
AAD00106403	Hmm. You should probably check on that, huh?
AAD00106404	I hope that didn't sound condscending. I didn't mean to be!
AAD00106405	You sure you don't know anything?
AAD00106406	I gotta go.
AAD00106407	Any chance you could help me get into Saint James' room?
AAD00106408	I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure if he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
AAD00106409	Part of my plan involves automated security for the region.
AAD00106410	That is somewhat reassuring, but we still don't have the resources to care for the entire Mojave by ourselves.
AAD00106411	We already experience regular supply shortages. Opening our door to the entire region... I don't see how this could ever work.
AAD00106412	I think the Followers should support an Independent Vegas through the coming battle at the dam.
AAD00106413	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
AAD00106414	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
AAD00106415	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by here in Freeside.
AAD00106416	I think the Followers should support NCR in the coming battle at the dam.
AAD00106417	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
AAD00106418	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
AAD00106419	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by here in Freeside.
AAD00106420	Why should we support the NCR? Their continual operational incompetence gets their soldiers killed, and they hold a monopoly on water in the Mojave.
AAD00106421	Sure, let me take a look at those magazines.
AAD00106422	What does it mean to join the Followers of the Apocalypse?
AAD00106423	Our aim is to gradually shape a better, brighter future for the wasteland.
AAD00106424	We seek to heal the planet through efforts not unlike the medicine and education we offer here in the Old Mormon Fort.
AAD00106425	All we ask is members and those seeking aid do their best to help those in need when the opportunity arises.
AAD00106426	Yes! I'll join.
AAD00106427	Excellent! The Followers' mission will be better served with someone like yourself traveling around the Mojave.
AAD00106428	As a representative of the Followers, I present you with your very own Lab Coat. Wear it well, and may it aid our cause.
AAD00106429	Also, before I forget, here's a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it on your map.
AAD00106430	50 caps or I walk.
AAD00106431	I'll give you whatever you want, just hurry!
AAD00106432	HanlonConfession
AAD00106433	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
AAD00106434	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help us get out of here, but... it didn't work out.
AAD00106435	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
AAD00106436	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
AAD00106437	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
AAD00106438	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
AAD00106439	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
AAD00106440	<250 caps needed> I can't meet your price right now.
AAD00106441	You'd say no to a guy like me? And here I thought you were special...
AAD00106442	Oh, don't you dare play that game with me. Fine, here's the key since it's so important to you.
AAD00106443	Is that what you guys do, pretend to be this guy?
AAD00106444	Somethin' like that, yeah. There were some working tapes here when we first got here, so we know what he sounded like.
AAD00106445	Sadly, they stopped working a few years back, so I sold them to a junk merchant who was passing through, otherwise I'd play some for you.
AAD00106446	All the outfits you see my guys wearing around were originally found in here, too. Along with more hair gel than you can shake a stick at.
AAD00106447	If this was a school, what was taught here?
AAD00106448	As far as we can tell, the guy that built this place was considered the coolest of the cool, and taught other people how to be more like him.
AAD00106449	People would come all around to learn how to sing, dance, dress, and even speak the way he did.
AAD00106450	This building is... interesting. What do you know about it?
AAD00106451	Near as I can tell, it was some sort of religious institution.
AAD00106452	Oh, I know it says "school" out front, but everything in here seemed to be related to the worship of some guy from back in the day.
AAD00106453	People used to come here to learn about him, to dress like him, move like him. To be him. If that's not worship, I don't know what is.
AAD00106454	You said something about a bunker at the Fort?
AAD00106455	Right, it's one of two locations on Mr. House's network with non-standard hardware.
AAD00106456	My guess is it has a reader that can decode the chip, and who knows what else? Maybe a giant robot or something!
AAD00106457	There's a bounty out on Powder Gangers?
AAD00106458	No, but there ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
AAD00106459	Is there anything else I should do before the battle?
AAD00106460	Well, some of Mr. House's projections predict a "moderate probability of civil instability subsequent to the NCR being driven from the Vegas region."
AAD00106461	One of the "mitigating contingencies" he planned was to enlist the Followers to provide increased medical aid throughout the region.
AAD00106462	Just seems like it might help keep things stable when we go independent. Not that I know what I'm talking about!
AAD00106463	There is victory in wisdom, Legate.
AAD00106464	Know that I shall return East. I shall not remain there forever. On that day, the strength of the Bear shall be tested.
AAD00106465	If the West is one day filled with ones such as you, perhaps it shall be a worthy fight, indeed.
AAD00106466	I suspect the Bear will surprise you in ways... in ways I can't even describe.
AAD00106467	I have faith. Trade helped us survive the Great War, it will do so again.
AAD00106468	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, woman of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
AAD00106469	You know you can't supply all the West any more than the Republic can.
AAD00106470	[Karma] Why don't you fight me yourself if you've got the spine for it, shithead.
AAD00106471	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
AAD00106472	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
AAD00106473	<Bluff> If you're such a "Terror" of the East, call off your dogs and face me one on one.
AAD00106474	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
AAD00106475	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
AAD00106476	I will await that day, Legate Lanius.
AAD00106477	Perhaps it is unfortunate Vulpes was not here to hear your words... something tells me you would prove more than his match.
AAD00106478	<Bluff> That strength... other Legates didn't see it either, until it was too late.
AAD00106479	[SUCCEEDED] We did take the towers easier than expected. I cannot believe even the Republic would overlook such an opening in their defenses.
AAD00106480	Yet we are at the throat of the Great Bear. Victory is at hand.
AAD00106481	<Bluff> The position of your veterans, using the Dam's intake towers - all as expected.
AAD00106482	<Bluff> But... history has shown defeat is assured. Uh, yours, that is.
AAD00106483	Maybe you're willing to listen to reason.
AAD00106484	I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the Bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater.
AAD00106485	Time for you to die, Mr. House.
AAD00106486	May there be... a hell... for you... a Tartarus... bleak, unending...
AAD00106487	vDialogueMrHouseCasinoPissed
AAD00106488	What do you think you're going to do? Fight your way up to the penthouse and assassinate me?
AAD00106489	<Lie> It matters - what honor is to be had in defeating a potentially superior foe with lies?
AAD00106490	<Confirmed Bachelor>
AAD00106491	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
AAD00106492	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AAD00106493	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
AAD00106494	<Black Widow>
AAD00106495	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
AAD00106496	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AAD00106497	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
AAD00106498	<Speech>
AAD00106499	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? You're right. I looked at the whole thing from the wrong angle.
AAD00106500	I suppose I could be a loving muse to some, while simply relieve stress and tension in others. Thanks for that insight.
AAD00106501	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
AAD00106502	You're a beacon of light in some people's depressing existence! Your work is art!
AAD00106503	Old Ben has the experience and skill you need.
AAD00106504	I've heard some stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AAD00106505	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AAD00106506	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AAD00106507	I've heard some stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AAD00106508	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AAD00106509	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
AAD00106510	I've heard some stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AAD00106511	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AAD00106512	I've heard some stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
AAD00106513	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
AAD00106514	Goodbye.
AAD00106515	Goodbye.
AAD00106516	Gun for hire?
AAD00106517	When I quit the escort job, I had enough money to buy a pistol belt and some other gear.
AAD00106518	Bodyguards make a good, honest living, and I had the wits and physical build to handle most thugs.
AAD00106519	After saving a few tourists from trouble, I got a reputation for being a stand-up guy again, and after a decade managed to save up enough to retire.
AAD00106520	What happened?
AAD00106521	Well, being a suave young guy, I chatted up the ladies from time to time, and one of the manager's girls started to take a liking to me.
AAD00106522	I never touched the woman, but the jealous prick decided it was my time to go. He framed me by saying I'd stolen from the casino.
AAD00106523	Sure enough, a few grand was missing from the casino vault. I have to assume the bastard stole the funds and figured I was a convenient fall guy.
AAD00106524	Butcher? How did you get into that?
AAD00106525	My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half our prices.
AAD00106526	How would you like to work for the Garrets?
AAD00106527	I'm retired, but life has been a bit dull without some kind of action. What's the job?
AAD00106528	How do you like the new job?
AAD00106529	It is a dream come true. Santiago never thought he could work in such a wonderous den of vice and iniquity.
AAD00106530	Can't do a worse job than the Republic, that's for sure.
AAD00106531	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by a slip of a woman. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best were making all that noise.
AAD00106532	How about I ask these robots to fuck you and your entire battalion with a rocket barrage?
AAD00106533	Do you know what you're doing? Making a nation - like you think you're doing, ain't like chowing down on a pile of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
AAD00106534	Think you got the guts to carve out a frontier? Build towns, protect the roads, run supplies, train troops?
AAD00106535	RadioBMSegment09
AAD00106536	 We were to normal Super Mutants what they were to humans, and they were told to defer to us in all things.
AAD00106537	 Which is why all Super Mutants should do what you say, right?
AAD00106538	RadioBMSegment07
AAD00106539	 My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that every mutant in the State of Utobitha has been give explicit orders regarding security.
AAD00106540	I'd like to hear about the Garret Twins.
AAD00106541	Them twins run the Atomic Wrangler, the only working casino here in Freeside. It's become pretty much the place to go around these parts.
AAD00106542	Give it a whirl when you've got some time. Now, was there anyone else you wanted to know about?
AAD00106543	What is there to do in Freeside?
AAD00106544	Aside from this place, there's the Atomic Wrangler just up the street. Women, gambling, booze, you name it, they got you covered.
AAD00106545	If you're more of a prude, the Followers run a mission out of the Old Mormon Fort up toward the north gate. Great place if you're hurt, I guess.
AAD00106546	If you like things dangerous, just past the Wrangler is the Silver Rush, where the Van Graff family peddles their weapons.
AAD00106547	Their stuff is outrageously priced, but if you want to shoot something hi-tech, that's the best game in town.
AAD00106548	VFSGuardPacerMocksGloria
AAD00106549	Actually, I've got a better idea. Make the new hire tell her. You'll do that for me, won't you?
AAD00106550	Hey, I've seen you before around our place. You've really fallen on hard times if you're working for these clowns.
AAD00106551	
AAD00106552	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's all right, if there's no other choice.
AAD00106553	I'm sure you're a man of your word, sir, but we still need to pat you down. No exceptions.
AAD00106554	Certainly, sir. We need to pat you down for weapons first.
AAD00106555	Now hold on here, I'm not packing any heat. Ain't my word good enough for you?
AAD00106556	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
AAD00106557	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm. Well... Vegas burns brighter than most cities West of the Divide, and that glitter has its appeal.
AAD00106558	Not sure that's going to mend fences with folks back West, though. But...
AAD00106559	There are... technologies in Vegas we may be able to provide to NCR. Not all, but some.
AAD00106560	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
AAD00106561	[FAILED] That kind of fence-sitting is exactly what makes me think we can make use of the... improvements here. Without you.
AAD00106562	Look, you've got two choices - leave, or fight.
AAD00106563	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
AAD00106564	<Attack> Actually, nothing of the sort. We've come to exterminate you.
AAD00106565	Figured as much. Come on, you sons of bitches, we're ready.
AAD00106566	Look, either you're going to leave, or you're going to fight. So decide.
AAD00106567	I think you're cashed out enough to know my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
AAD00106568	Um, well, I'm sure if I ask them they'll be on board.
AAD00106569	[FAILED] I think they blew their load here today with their fireworks... they'll prefer targets closer to home.
AAD00106570	Even if you fixed the generators, hacking the code won't be easy.
AAD00106571	[SUCCEEDED] Fucking Pre-War RobCo pieces of shit...
AAD00106572	Even if you fix it, you couldn't re-program the power grid, the systems are fried.
AAD00106573	You think these robots are all the forces I have?
AAD00106574	Right now, that's all that's standing there - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
AAD00106575	Because the Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
AAD00106576	Lot of Pre-War factories and tech lying around the Mojave, our engineers'll get it running again, no matter how much damage you've done down there.
AAD00106577	I'm going to rest for a bit, if you don't mind.
AAD00106578	Kind of curious how this is going to pan out in the long run... but I guess history'll tell us in its own sweet time.
AAD00106579	Sometimes I wonder if NCR wouldn't lose the whole West if they weren't sitting on it.
AAD00106580	Look. The NCR isn't everyone here, and it definitely ain't you.
AAD00106581	It's filled with people that take action and don't wait for someone to say what's right and wrong and make sure the proper form's filled out.
AAD00106582	When there's an example of that kind of success... that can shake things up enough so the good that came with the intention shines through.
AAD00106583	I couldn't have done it alone, and I appreciate the assist along the way.
AAD00106584	Least we could do. And seeing those shits of Caesar kicking dirt as they ran - did my heart good, let me tell you.
AAD00106585	Might see some recruitment number rise, build some morale out in the Mojave long enough for NCR to find its feet again.
AAD00106586	All due to you - again, you have my thanks. And all the West, too, once they pass it over the radio... after signing the right release forms.
AAD00106587	It was my duty, General - I was glad to help out.
AAD00106588	And we're glad to have you - and whether you're a soldier of the Republic or not, you're it in my eyes.
AAD00106589	Sometimes the Republic gets lost along the way while it's trying to follow its instincts... but when soldiers like you come along...
AAD00106590	It helps them get back on track, and does it by example. And what you've done here today, that's going to keep us going for a while.
AAD00106591	Did you say NCR whores, before?
AAD00106592	A woman named Emily asked me to bug one of your data terminals.
AAD00106593	Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
AAD00106594	You thought I wouldn't notice?
AAD00106595	I should let you know that I planted a surveillance device on one of your data terminals.
AAD00106596	VFSSimonPlayerRunningOff
AAD00106597	What did I tell you about trying to make off with that gear?
AAD00106598	VFSSimonCallsForBackup
AAD00106599	I could use some help out here!
AAD00106600	We're going to have to search you first.
AAD00106601	Fine by me.
AAD00106602	VHSecuritronHouse
AAD00106603	I'd pay very close attention to what she has to say, as well as any official papers she hands over for your perusal.

AAD00106605	The General's "accident" was unfortunate... with Kimball dead, the angry Californian public could've used an alternate scapegoat to pillory...
AAD00106606	General Oliver will try to make good on his threats, and he'll find support among citizens outraged by Kimball's assassination...
AAD00106607	The odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion, however, are slight. My Securitrons could beat them, anyway.
AAD00106608	Let's talk about something else.
AAD00106609	Oh, well, if you change your mind let me know. I have some parts here I can use to upgrade his armor if you leave it with me for a bit.
AAD00106610	Is there another way to get Mr. House's data?
AAD00106611	I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.
AAD00106612	What's going on around here?
AAD00106613	Well, crops aren't doing so well. I'm thinking it might be something in the water.
AAD00106614	The pump station is pretty run down. You could go take a look around the place, see if you find anything strange going on. What do you say?
AAD00106615	Come on. Let's get out of here.
AAD00106616	Good idea.
AAD00106617	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm reuniting the Remnants, and they'll need your piloting skills.
AAD00106618	Told you everything about us, did he? Well, it's been a while since I've had my hands on the controls of a vertibird.
AAD00106619	There's a chance I could crash us in the middle of Lake Mead - that place seems to attract aircraft, for some reason.
AAD00106620	But, if I get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
AAD00106621	Is there a health inspector bothering you?
AAD00106622	Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple of weeks back.
AAD00106623	I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait another 11 months to see his crooked ass to get my caps back. Ah well, anything I can get you?
AAD00106624	You didn't think to tell anyone about this?
AAD00106625	Yeah, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
AAD00106626	The only reason why I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
AAD00106627	Did Benny say why he had the Securitron?
AAD00106628	He sure didn't. Benny was pretty tight-lipped and cryptic about the thing, but he did let me poke around in it for a while.
AAD00106629	I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securitron's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
AAD00106630	Big surprise, right? I should have seen that coming.
AAD00106631	Goodbye.
AAD00106632	See you when I see you.
AAD00106633	What's the big deal?
AAD00106634	[FAILED] Just drop it, okay?
AAD00106635	Hey, I risked a lot to get you that data feed.
AAD00106636	[SUCCEEDED] True. All right. The first try was a little less "professional". Someone important on the Strip had access to some of House's technology.
AAD00106637	Specifically, a Securitron. And more specifically, the "someone" was Benny. I know, I know... he shot you in the head and everything.
AAD00106638	But this was a while ago. I knew he was sleazy, but I didn't realize he was so cold-blooded.
AAD00106639	I work against the NCR as much as I work for them. This is no different.
AAD00106640	So you help them at the Dam only to screw them over big time later? All right, I'll go along with this, then. I hope I don't regret it.
AAD00106641	What is this place?
AAD00106642	This was a minor refueling station for vertibirds. It seemed an appropriate place to stash our equipment if we ever needed it.
AAD00106643	I'm surprised this place hasn't fallen apart. When I put it into standby mode, I expected to return to it within a few years, not decades.
AAD00106644	Are you always here?
AAD00106645	I'm usually here a few days out of the week. Mostly to keep the fridge stocked. Plus it's nice to get away from it all every now and then.
AAD00106646	Goodbye.
AAD00106647	Vale.
AAD00106648	Why are you here?
AAD00106649	I like to check up on things from time to time. I can't let this place fall apart, now, can I?
AAD00106650	Since you're here, I can offer you some medical supplies. I can't give you everything I have, but I can give you a few things.
AAD00106651	VCassFreesideSass04
AAD00106652	Somebody's asking for a boot in their fusebox.
AAD00106653	Explosives.
AAD00106654	Cateye.
AAD00106655	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
AAD00106656	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
AAD00106657	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
AAD00106658	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
AAD00106659	Radiation supplies.
AAD00106660	Here you go.
AAD00106661	Getting sucker punched by Benny happens to the best of us.
AAD00106662	Good point.
AAD00106663	Alcohol is the only way Benny could ever get any action from a smart girl like you.
AAD00106664	That's sweet of you to say, even if it isn't true.
AAD00106665	Don't be so hard on yourself. Life would be dull if it weren't for all the little mistakes.
AAD00106666	I take it you're speaking from experience.
AAD00106667	You're right though. He's gone now, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. Thanks.
AAD00106668	Tell me again about Benny's Securitron.
AAD00106669	Not much to tell. Benny had one of Mr. House's Securitrons, deactivated, and wanted it switched back on.
AAD00106670	He had heard I was interested in Mr. House's technology so he hit me up... so to speak.
AAD00106671	You can't seriously think they're the same Mr. House.
AAD00106672	Maybe not. Maybe the new guy is just a clever raider chief with knowledge of history.
AAD00106673	Maybe he just left instructions for his robots to carry out in his name.
AAD00106674	Or maybe Robert House uploaded his brain pattern into a computer and rules to this day, a godless, soulless machine-god!
AAD00106675	Maybe the whole thing's a crazy coincidence. Who knows?
AAD00106676	I'm looking for the man who shot me: he wears a checkered coat and carries a shiny pistol. Seen him?
AAD00106677	Sure, boss. I saw lots of guys like that while I was held prisoner by an insane Super Mutant in an isolated mountain fortress. Can you narrow it down?
AAD00106678	Benny, huh? Sorry, boss, doesn't ring a bell. Then again, my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be.
AAD00106679	Do you know anything about a goon named Benny? Wears a checkered coat, carries a big pistol?
AAD00106680	RaulStory3
AAD00106681	I left everything when I left Mexico: my home, my family, my name - even my face. I know it's surprising, boss, but I wasn't always this handsome.
AAD00106682	As far as the world knows, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tucson - not Two-Sun, by the way.
AAD00106683	Things were good there. Well, maybe not good, but better than Mexico City, anyways. I found myself a little shack and started fixing things.
AAD00106684	RaulStory1
AAD00106685	I grew up in a place called Hidalgo Ranch just outside Mexico City. It wasn't much, just a bit of a farm with a house for three generations of Tejadas.
AAD00106686	I wasn't the best-behaved kid. I was quick with my hands, with a pistol or a wrench, and I wasn't afraid to get into fights over it.
AAD00106687	I never killed anybody, but I had my share of run-ins with the police. Mostly my family kept me in line.
AAD00106688	This was before the war. We were far enough away from Mexico City when the bombs fell that we missed the worst of it - but things got bad quick.
AAD00106689	How come your last name isn't Van Graff?
AAD00106690	Unlike most of my brothers and sisters, Mama didn't get sick of my father and get rid of him. He died right before I was born.
AAD00106691	Mama had liked him so much, she made us use his last name. Said he deserved that much at least, since he never got to meet me or nothin'.
AAD00106692	You again? How'd you find me here?
AAD00106693	I am the greatest of Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
AAD00106694	<Lie> I was hoping you'd want to take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
AAD00106695	Where is he now?
AAD00106696	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
AAD00106697	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
AAD00106698	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
AAD00106699	Are you talking about Andy, or yourself?
AAD00106700	A little bit of both, I guess.
AAD00106701	He didn't have to give it up, he's just scared he doesn't have what it takes anymore.
AAD00106702	Maybe, but what if he really doesn't have it?
AAD00106703	I don't believe that. You must have some skills.
AAD00106704	How can I make the best use of your skills?
AAD00106705	Felt good to put the old vaquero outfit on again. I feel a lot sharper with a pistol now. I still wouldn't put these old bones on the front lines.
AAD00106706	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
AAD00106707	But how did Tabitha find you in the first place?
AAD00106708	Ah, it's stupid, boss. I used to listen to the radio broadcasts, just to pass the time.
AAD00106709	Well, one day the signal stopped, so I figured I'd try to find the transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before my eyes started to go.
AAD00106710	Anyway, I found Black Mountain and offered my services, but Tabitha decided I was useful enough to keep around. Permanently.
AAD00106711	How'd you end up at Black Mountain?
AAD00106712	Well, boss, when a giant, insane Super Mutant asks you to stay put, you do what you're told. Well, maybe you don't, but I'm just a broke down old man.
AAD00106713	Where are you from?
AAD00106714	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
AAD00106715	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
AAD00106716	I headed up into Tucson and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
AAD00106717	And that, boss, is all she wrote.
AAD00106718	VEndingConclusion
AAD00106719	And so the Courier's road came to an end... for now.
AAD00106720	In the new world of the Mojave Wasteland, fighting continued, blood was spilled, and many lived and died - just as they had in the Old World.
AAD00106721	Because war... war never changes.
AAD00106722	VEndingIntro
AAD00106723	And so the Courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again, and the Mojave Wasteland was forever changed.
AAD00106724	VEndingRangers
AAD00106725	After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
AAD00106726	Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
AAD00106727	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
AAD00106728	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
AAD00106729	Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
AAD00106730	Hanlon, exhausted from a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
AAD00106731	VEndingPrimm
AAD00106732	Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers chooses to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
AAD00106733	Though the citizens take out a few Legionaries, the town quickly falls to Caesar, its citizens utterly wiped out.
AAD00106734	VEndingPowderGang
AAD00106735	After the Vault 19 Powder Gang surrendered to the NCR, they were re-incorporated into the correctional system.
AAD00106736	The NCR did increase their sentences, and they aren't about to take off time for good behavior.
AAD00106737	With Cooke dead, the Powder Gangers at Vault 19 fell apart.
AAD00106738	Those who weren't destroyed by the Courier fled into the hills or attempted to work their way back through the Mojave Wasteland. Few survived.
AAD00106739	VEndingKings
AAD00106740	After their victory at Hoover Dam, the Legion quickly set about destroying all remaining resistance, including any groups with ties to the NCR.
AAD00106741	Upon discovering the Kings' newfound relationship with the NCR, Legionnaires flooded the streets of Freeside, and the Kings were quickly destroyed.
AAD00106742	Impressed with the Kings' continued attacks upon NCR citizens and soldiers, the Legion offered them the option of being assimilated into the Legion.
AAD00106743	The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after a failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
AAD00106744	VEndingJacobstown
AAD00106745	Thanks to the Courier and Lily, a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was found shortly after Doctor Henry's experiment concluded.
AAD00106746	Nightkin and other Super Mutants in the wasteland flocked to Jacobstown, and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace.
AAD00106747	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
AAD00106748	Most Nightkin at Jacobstown followed their leader, Keene, out into the wasteland, terrorizing the Mojave for years to come.
AAD00106749	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
AAD00106750	VEndingFollowers
AAD00106751	After the Legion's victory, Caesar, out of a strange respect for his old fellows, allowed the Followers safe passage out of the wasteland.
AAD00106752	Reluctantly, the Followers accepted the offer and abandoned Old Mormon Fort to the Legion.
AAD00106753	VEndingBrotherhood
AAD00106754	The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley.
AAD00106755	With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along I-15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.
AAD00106756	Due to their temporary truce, the Brotherhood allowed the NCR to retreat from the Mojave Wasteland without incident.
AAD00106757	In the relative peace that followed, Brotherhood patrols appeared along major roads, harassing travelers over any bits of technology they had.
AAD00106758	VEndingBoomers
AAD00106759	After the battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR mounted several campaigns against the Boomers, but all were quickly ended by the Boomers' artillery.
AAD00106760	Over time, as the Boomers found a need for gunpowder, they developed a relationship with the Gun Runners, trading their surplus crops for munitions.
AAD00106761	VEndingCourier
AAD00106762	The Courier, fair and even-handed in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
AAD00106763	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
AAD00106764	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
AAD00106765	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, partly out of gratitude, and partly out of fear.
AAD00106766	VEndingNCR
AAD00106767	The New California Republic celebrated its second victory at Hoover Dam, establishing definitive control over the entire Mojave Wasteland.
AAD00106768	Soon after, they negotiated terms to annex The Strip, Freeside, and many surrounding communities.
AAD00106769	The Mojave Wasteland, at long last, had entirely fallen under the NCR's banner.
AAD00106770	VEndingCaesarDead
AAD00106771	The Legate is crowned as the new Caesar. He entered The Strip as though it was a military target, destroying anyone who resisted him.
AAD00106772	The Legion brutally occupied all major locations, killing and enslaving a large amount of the population.
AAD00106773	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - savage as it was - finally came to the Mojave Wasteland.
AAD00106774	VEndingCaesarAlive
AAD00106775	Caesar entered The Strip as though it was his Triumph. The Legion pushed the NCR out of New Vegas entirely, driving them back to the Mojave Outpost.
AAD00106776	The Legion occupied all major locations, enslaving much of the population and peacefully lording over the rest.
AAD00106777	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - unforgiving as it was - finally came to the Mojave Wasteland.
AAD00106778	VEndingEdE
AAD00106779	ED-E traveled with the Courier until one of its memory banks was triggered causing it to continue its travels on to Navarro.
AAD00106780	Upon reaching Navarro ED-E vanished and was not seen in the wastes again.
AAD00106781	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E remained a vigilant and constant companion to the Courier.
AAD00106782	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
AAD00106783	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E remained a vigilant and constant companion to the Courier.
AAD00106784	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
AAD00106785	Shady Sands.
AAD00106786	Right. Fine then, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AAD00106787	The Boneyard.
AAD00106788	Right. Fine then, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
AAD00106789	Can I take the test again?
AAD00106790	I probably shouldn't let you, but I suppose everyone has a bad day now and then. Did you want to take it now?
AAD00106791	
AAD00106792	[SUCCEEDED] You don't look like you're from around here, so, I guess I can believe that.
AAD00106793	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
AAD00106794	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
AAD00106795	<Lie> Sure am. I just recently arrived here from California.

AAD00106811	FollowersOverburdened
AAD00106812	Get a porter. Carrying someone's bags - not my style.
AAD00106813	How did you like flying vertibirds for the Enclave?
AAD00106814	I was never happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
AAD00106815	There were more than a few missions where I took the scenic route home just so I could stay in the air. Caught hell for it every time, but worth it!
AAD00106816	Some of the things we did were questionable, I know. That's just how it was back then. Figure I've done enough good to make up for any sins, anyhow.
AAD00106817	I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to you. Well, not really.
AAD00106818	Like I'd hang around to find out!
AAD00106819	VCampGolfHanlonRepBranch
AAD00106820	I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
AAD00106821	If you're going to be associating with Rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
AAD00106822	I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
AAD00106823	If the Rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
AAD00106824	Why is the Brotherhood interested in Nevada?
AAD00106825	It was the Dam, really. We'd heard rumors it was working. Figured we could claim it, put it to use.
AAD00106826	And... it may also have been partly that our Elder at the time had worn out his welcome.
AAD00106827	Didn't end up mattering. We got sidetracked at HELIOS One and the NCR took the Dam in the meantime. We're still after it, though. In theory.
AAD00106828	
AAD00106829	[SUCCEEDED] O-Of course not! We're here to serve the good citizens of the NCR. Please, head on through.
AAD00106830	You already let me in the other night! Do all of us civilians look the same to you soldier boys?
AAD00106831	[SUCCEEDED] If you're here to see the Major, then I suppose it's all right. Head on through.
AAD00106832	I'm here to see Major Kieran on urgent business. Please let me pass.
AAD00106833	[FAILED] Since you put it like that, no. Not unless you know the password. Do you know the password?
AAD00106834	Come on, guys, you can let me in, right? Right?
AAD00106835	Sure, teach me.
AAD00106836	All right, put 'em up. Let's see what you got.
AAD00106837	VDialogueVeronicaULDressReceived
AAD00106838	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, no, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! Oh, it's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
AAD00106839	I... wish I had something to give you. I- wait! What about punching? That's the gift that keeps on giving.
AAD00106840	I could work on your punching with you, if you like. Show you how to counter like a Scribe.
AAD00106841	If you think staying here's any better...
AAD00106842	[FAILED] I got a bar, men who don't say a word, and plenty of whiskey, I'm fine.
AAD00106843	<Storage Node for Variables: Do Not Translate.>
AAD00106844	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
AAD00106845	I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do it.
AAD00106846	That's just fucking great. I knew you didn't have what it takes from the start, but would Glory listen to me? No.
AAD00106847	Still, my sister has plans for you, so I'll cut you a break. You bring the girl here, and I'll take care of the fun part. That's fair, eh?
AAD00106848	Looking to join up with me again?
AAD00106849	Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
AAD00106850	Good to hear. The wasteland is no place for children.
AAD00106851	I agree. That's why we do everything we can to teach the children from birth to defend themselves and serve the tribe.
AAD00106852	You should know I've been helpful to the Followers, so come clean about White if you know something.
AAD00106853	Some of the other Followers mentioned you. All right - the truth, then.
AAD00106854	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
AAD00106855	We don't have money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
AAD00106856	I thought you said I didn't have to kill her.
AAD00106857	Yeah, if you brought her back here. Is she behind you or something? 'Cause I don't see her.
AAD00106858	Now stop stalling, get out there, and do your fucking job already. Sheesh.
AAD00106859	Is that what you did?
AAD00106860	Would it surprise you to know that I used to be a gunslinging adventurer?
AAD00106861	The NCR put a lot of time and money into his training. He owes it to them to use it however he can.
AAD00106862	Even if he can't use it any more? Isn't that like asking you to come up with one of your brilliant schemes after suffering a crippling head wound?
AAD00106863	Err, another one, I mean?
AAD00106864	Tell me about your Dad.
AAD00106865	Not much to tell. He ended up walking East one day when I was young and never came back. Not a family deserter like some, though.
AAD00106866	Mom died waiting for him, and she had me to raise. She was sick but she held off dying until I was old enough to be getting into trouble with the boys.
AAD00106867	As for Dad, I figure he just got himself lost or dead. Happens... and I'm not all boo-hoo about it, so save your glass for someone who's crying.
AAD00106868	And you blame yourself for this?
AAD00106869	Maybe. I don't know. All I know is, that for all my skills with a pistol, I couldn't help them.
AAD00106870	Anyway, that was weighing on my mind. Thanks for letting me get it out in the open, boss.
AAD00106871	What happened then?
AAD00106872	About two dozen men came back in the night, after we'd gone to sleep. They set fire to the ranch house and barred the doors from the outside.
AAD00106873	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and I got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out through a window, but everyone else....
AAD00106874	My parents, my grandmother, my two brothers and two of my sisters all died.
AAD00106875	All right. Come on, let's go.
AAD00106876	Thank god, the sooner the better.
AAD00106877	What's wrong?
AAD00106878	Aside from the TV-faced robots, the dust, and the old man smell in every room? Nothing, it's a paradise.
AAD00106879	This place has the Old World Blues about it. Everything in here feels like it should have passed on a long time ago.
AAD00106880	Hell, it's hard to believe Vegas is right outside. So, yeah, I'm looking to leave whenever you're ready.
AAD00106881	If your world's a whiskey bottle, there's more out there.
AAD00106882	Oh, that's got just the right bite of judgment to it, stings a little, too. Did you hear that from a Followers preacher?
AAD00106883	I bet you could preach all day. Who knows what other little bits of wisdom might spill out.
AAD00106884	There's other places to go.
AAD00106885	Where? Like Vegas? Chewed and spit enough friends out. East? Get put in one of Caesar's little "camps?" No thanks.
AAD00106886	Head back West? I already know the Big Circle and everyone in it - 'cept now I go back there, ruined.
AAD00106887	Never really realized how small the Mojave's getting nowadays - hard to find a place to go to that's worthwhile.
AAD00106888	Any work around here?
AAD00106889	If you're looking to sign on with a caravan, no - traders are bottled up tight here.
AAD00106890	Caravan work's up north - check with the Crimson Caravan, maybe. Gun Runners might have work, wouldn't know for sure, though.
AAD00106891	Still, if you got a gun, guts, and feeling like going on patrol, might be some of the soldiers around here have work for you.
AAD00106892	Sniper on the roof?
AAD00106893	Yeah, her name's... Ghost or something... fucking scary, ooooooh. Guess it's cause you'll never see her 'til you're dead.
AAD00106894	NCR and their goddamn nicknames, as if Caesar himself's gonna piss and run if he hears them.
AAD00106895	Anyway, go on and head up top, ask her what's going on, if you haven't already. I don't much give a shit.
AAD00106896	BMRhondaLetsGoTabitha
AAD00106897	Mistress Tabitha, we should be heading off. Our journey has been much delayed, but we can catch up if we hurry. Come along, now.
AAD00106898	BMTabithaCornersPlayer
AAD00106899	R-Rhonda? Is that you?
AAD00106900	I don't think it was personal.
AAD00106901	Well, if it wasn't before, it is now.
AAD00106902	Did he bother to introduce himself, or did he not take you for somebody who'd get up again when killed?
AAD00106903	Not exciting enough for you?
AAD00106904	It ain't so bad. If Caesar's Legion decides to push West through Nipton, ol' Mojave Outpost here will be the front line.
AAD00106905	I'm trying to do better... really trying.
AAD00106906	[FAILED] Trying's the same thing as giving up, the way you're saying it.
AAD00106907	<Lie> I heard you, I did. I've changed... inside.
AAD00106908	[FAILED] Inside? Yeah, must be deep inside, all right.
AAD00106909	I'm... not proud of what I've done. I'm trying to change, really.
AAD00106910	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
AAD00106911	<Lie> Look... I'm trying to change, life's tough.
AAD00106912	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
AAD00106913	What do you need to take over protecting the town?
AAD00106914	What we need, more than anything, is bodies.
AAD00106915	If we had just one more squad, we could easily install a sheriff and still handle our primary objective of protecting the interstate south of here.
AAD00106916	If you'd like to see the NCR include protection of Primm in its duties, then you'll have to get some more troops up here.
AAD00106917	Knight, at Mojave Outpost, may be able to help.
AAD00106918	So what did you do?
AAD00106919	I left Mexico City behind. I made my way out to the Gulf Coast, eventually I found an old Petro-Chico refinery nobody had claimed.
AAD00106920	I stayed there for a little while, and I thought a lot about my life. I thought about the guns I'd lived by and what they'd gotten me.
AAD00106921	I decided my guns hadn't gotten me anything, and it was time to give it up. I took off the old vaquero outfit, and put on a Petro-Chico jumpsuit.
AAD00106922	The name tag said "Miguel," so I started using the name myself. Eventually I made it to Arizona... but that's another story, boss.
AAD00106923	That's terrible, Raul.
AAD00106924	Terrible doesn't begin to cover it, boss. I'd let my whole family down - first the ranch, now Rafaela. I was the last Tejada.
AAD00106925	I guess maybe I went a little crazy then. I took my guns and went back to that market. I didn't have many bullets, but I had enough.
AAD00106926	After the raiders were dead, I salvaged what I could from the store. I was tired... I just wanted to be alone forever.
AAD00106927	Go on. What happened to Rafaela?
AAD00106928	She went out to find some food one day. I was sick, so I stayed at our camp. I guess it must have been the beginning of radiation poisoning.
AAD00106929	Anyway, it was supposed to be safe, but some raiders happened to pass through where she was scavenging. I won't speak of what they did to her.
AAD00106930	When I found her body, the only way to recognize her was this funny little scar on her knee from when she was a little girl.
AAD00106931	Wasn't it dangerous to be dressed so... noticeably?
AAD00106932	It was. I started to build up a legend. Sometimes it headed off trouble, but most of the time it just started more.
AAD00106933	Young punks looking to prove themselves would come looking for me, but my eyes were sharp and my guns were quick.
AAD00106934	For a while it seemed like we might even survive there, until... until Rafaela.
AAD00106935	Sounds pretty bad.
AAD00106936	You're a poet of understatement, boss. But there were moments it was almost worth it. I still remember finding that novelty costume shop.
AAD00106937	I was just looking around for something I could slice up to wrap my burns, when I saw the vaquero outfit hanging on the rack, like it hadn't been touched.
AAD00106938	I took it - not like anybody else needed it, you know? - and wore it back to our camp. Rafaela laughed for the first time since the bombs had fallen.
AAD00106939	You're wrong. You can still fight, and you should take up your guns again.
AAD00106940	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about you let me make this decision?
AAD00106941	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
AAD00106942	I don't think that's a good idea. You should focus on your mechanical skills instead.
AAD00106943	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about you let me make this decision?
AAD00106944	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
AAD00106945	What happened then?
AAD00106946	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tucson and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AAD00106947	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AAD00106948	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize I've always had my doubts.
AAD00106949	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tucson and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AAD00106950	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AAD00106951	After seeing what you go through, I think I made the right choice. So thanks for that, boss.
AAD00106952	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tucson and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
AAD00106953	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
AAD00106954	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize that was the wrong decision. So thanks for that, boss.
AAD00106955	What happened with her?
AAD00106956	This was a long time ago. Before Caesar's Legion pacified Arizona and brought the raider tribes to heel.
AAD00106957	A tribe came into Tucson one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
AAD00106958	I figured if I did that, they'd leave town before they tore it up too much.
AAD00106959	Why aren't you still there, then?
AAD00106960	Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tucson - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tucson, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
AAD00106961	Prettiest thing you ever saw, boss. Maybe it was just a trick of my senile brain, but I swear she looked just like my Rafaela. Her name was Claudia.
AAD00106962	She ended up taking work at one of the brothels in town. I never went to her, of course - how could I? But I looked after her in my own way.
AAD00106963	< Sneak 25 >
AAD00106964	[FAILED] No thank you. Good luck with your, uh, "ambush."
AAD00106965	I could probably take out the Powder Gang by surprise, if I had help. Probably.
AAD00106966	< Speech 25 >
AAD00106967	[SUCCEEDED] I was planning on sitting this one out, but for some reason I can't help but like you. I'm with you.
AAD00106968	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
AAD00106969	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
AAD00106970	You should help me take down the Powder Gang. Bullets, explosions, lots of fun.
AAD00106971	[FAILED] All the more reason for me to sit this one out. I'll be rooting for you, though.
AAD00106972	Uh, we're a little outnumbered against the Powder Gang. Think you could help?
AAD00106973	< Barter 20 >
AAD00106974	[SUCCEEDED] Not at all! I'm never sure how much is normally charged for this sort of thing. Here's some additional caps - that should be enough.
AAD00106975	Now, how about spending some of those caps in the saloon?
AAD00106976	That's it? Are you implying that I've done shoddy work?
AAD00106977	Jack is interested in a girl.
AAD00106978	Well, well, this is welcome news. Who is she?
AAD00106979	She works for the Crimson Caravan.
AAD00106980	She's with those traders? They've tried to contact us before, but I'm not interested in trading with greedy savages.
AAD00106981	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
AAD00106982	Where should I go to get you a pardon?
AAD00106983	There's a NCR camp down there on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think. Try to find someone of authority there.
AAD00106984	What do you mean, "took me long enough"?
AAD00106985	Sorry. I assumed the only reason you'd fight past a horde of Super Mutants and pick the lock on my cell is if you heard my cry for help on the radio.
AAD00106986	But maybe you're just sightseeing. So, since the door's open and all, can I go now?
AAD00106987	Yes, here are their holotapes.
AAD00106988	They were all dead, then. I suppose I'm not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
AAD00106989	But we must turn our minds to other matters. When I sent out those patrols, I also sent three Knights out on scouting missions.
AAD00106990	When the patrols failed to return, we assumed the worst and sent a single communication to the scouts to hold position and maintain radio silence.
AAD00106991	I want you to contact those scouts and gather their reports. Like the patrols, they have devices on them that will enable you to track them.
AAD00106992	When you find them, tell them you're my representative and ask them if the bears are still hunting. That should get them to talk to you.
AAD00106993	Return when you've gathered all of their reports.
AAD00106994	I'd like to hear about that personal matter you mentioned.
AAD00106995	I thought you weren't interested.
AAD00106996	<Speech>
AAD00106997	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
AAD00106998	Take a deep breath and focus, Lindsay. Where were you with him last?
AAD00106999	[FAILED] I don't know. I play all over. I'll never find him!
AAD00107000	Any idea where I should start looking, kid?
AAD00107001	You have our word.
AAD00107002	That'll have to do. God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
AAD00107003	If the Republic's sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this. I know revenge must have been tempting.
AAD00107004	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
AAD00107005	God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
AAD00107006	If the Republic's sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this. I know revenge must have been tempting.
AAD00107007	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
AAD00107008	Can you get it to the right people?
AAD00107009	No. No, I can't. Because this evidence might be true... but it doesn't just implicate them.
AAD00107010	It's a motive for what happened up North, someone went cruising through both compounds, killed them all.
AAD00107011	I'm guessing that was you. If so, you're not leaving this outpost except in chains.
AAD00107012	I can, if you make me a promise.
AAD00107013	I need you to swear you won't take revenge on Gloria or Alice. If you do, then your case is over, and we can't see that justice is done.
AAD00107014	I know some things are hard to let go, but you and Miss Cassidy need to understand that, hear me?
AAD00107015	Got it, let's start looting.
AAD00107016	Don't have to tell me twice, feel more alive than I ever have.
AAD00107017	Why would they have done it during the day?
AAD00107018	We should check the wagon - they may not have got everything.
AAD00107019	Whatever we find, it's yours - least I can do for hoofing it all this way with me.
AAD00107020	So the Mojave suffers.
AAD00107021	Aside from the people in the towns, it's the soldiers that suffer for it most.
AAD00107022	Ever seen NCR troops asked to go after gangs at three-to-one odds? That bear flag doesn't make them bulletproof.
AAD00107023	And when those gangs were caused by NCR in the first place, like the Powder Gangers? Caesar on a crutch, don't get me started there.
AAD00107024	Miss Cassidy... are you flirting with me?
AAD00107025	As long as we keep it on that level.
AAD00107026	What? Oh. All right. Guess you've got a Legion outlook on things. No problems here, there's a lot more of that in the Mojave than you see.
AAD00107027	Soft men don't stay that way around me, I've found.
AAD00107028	Well, don't let the soldiers drink too much, and I'd agree with you most time. Fucking whiskey dicks.
AAD00107029	That's... rarely an issue.
AAD00107030	What? Oh. Damn, no offense meant. Sometimes I get so drunk, I don't care who I share a bed with, so that's fine with me.
AAD00107031	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
AAD00107032	I'm familiar. Do *you* know what a fish is?
AAD00107033	Well... of course I do.
AAD00107034	Let me think about it.
AAD00107035	It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get your support.
AAD00107036	Who did you say I should talk to again?
AAD00107037	Knight, he's at Mojave Outpost.
AAD00107038	Speech
AAD00107039	[SUCCEEDED] I like the way you think. Oratory may indeed be a useful tool in our arsenal if wielded effectively.
AAD00107040	I could probably put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
AAD00107041	Talking enemies down is an effective way to get what you want and save ammo.
AAD00107042	[FAILED] Talking? Seriously? Sorry pal, but nothing is more persuasive than bullets and bombs, and we're the experts!
AAD00107043	I think I can teach you things about public speaking.
AAD00107044	Barter
AAD00107045	[FAILED] It doesn't look like we're going to be trading with anyone outside of Nellis anytime soon, so I'd rather not bother.
AAD00107046	I could teach you some tricks about trading.
AAD00107047	Guns
AAD00107048	[SUCCEEDED] Wow, our stockpiles mostly include full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
AAD00107049	I can teach how to make jacketed hollow points and other specialized ammo.
AAD00107050	Repair
AAD00107051	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, that's a great idea! This information might help with our training manuals, and maybe create a few new apprentices for Loyal.
AAD00107052	I've done a lot of machining and lathe work over the years. I could write up a booklet for you.
AAD00107053	[FAILED] Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still will with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
AAD00107054	Oh the stories I could tell you about fixing stuff with duct tape and bubble gum!
AAD00107055	Anything else?
AAD00107056	Well, up north a ways you'll see a big tower. That's HELIOS One. Used to be a power plant in its day.
AAD00107057	And there's a town just east of here called Nelson. Used to be such a quaint little place until those slavers took it over.
AAD00107058	But we got our wonderful snipers keeping an eye in that direction, and so far the slavers have left us alone.
AAD00107059	I convinced Corporal Betsy to get help from Doctor Usanagi.
AAD00107060	Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with the treatment as long as it's necessary.
AAD00107061	I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels it's taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
AAD00107062	I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with the treatment because of what you said.
AAD00107063	I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
AAD00107064	Why do you think you let Betsy down?
AAD00107065	She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
AAD00107066	Nobody w-wanted to work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
AAD00107067	She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit.
AAD00107068	What's wrong with Betsy?
AAD00107069	Cook-Cook, one of the Fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
AAD00107070	Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
AAD00107071	It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
AAD00107072	RaulPvtEdwards
AAD00107073	Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad. Sure, your skin rots off and you start to stink like a public toilet after Cinco de Mayo, but... umm....
AAD00107074	What? How is that not bad? In fact, how could it get worse?
AAD00107075	Well, assuming you survive the radiation sickness, the lynch mobs, and the possibility of going feral, one day you'll get old and decrepit, like me.
AAD00107076	Oh god!
AAD00107077	What? Was it something I said?
AAD00107078	RaulSearchlight
AAD00107079	I guess hunting down ghouls like wild animals is okay. I mean, they're probably going to die anyway, right boss?
AAD00107080	RaulJacobstown
AAD00107081	Just putting this out there, boss: if these Super Mutants kidnap us and force us to fix toasters for them, it's on you.
AAD00107082	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
AAD00107083	Not much to tell. One of the worst posts in the NCR if you're looking to be anything more than a babysitter.
AAD00107084	Full up here, but just enough so we can't send out patrols. Got to maintain a "standing force," Jackson's orders... NCR's orders.
AAD00107085	Can't spare men for patrols or escorts, so caravans are backing up here like a Brahmin with a bottle in its ass. Typical NCR bullshit.
AAD00107086	I could use a Vault trinket.
AAD00107087	Of course, please, take this! We carried as much useful technology as we could, before our journey into the surface world.
AAD00107088	I don't need anything in return for my help.
AAD00107089	It fills me with hope to see that people from the surface world are kind, and brave. Again, thank you.
AAD00107090	How's the "surface world" treating you?
AAD00107091	Kindly! The leaders of this fine community have accepted us among them. They give us food and protection from the outside.
AAD00107092	Some people here seem extremely unhappy. They keep talking about getting "shafted," "swindled," and "fucked."
AAD00107093	Apparently somebody did them ill, all the way inside the surface-city with lights - the Strip, and Freeside, they call it.
AAD00107094	We're lucky to be here, alive and well. The land's a mystery to us, but we'll find our place in it.
AAD00107095	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
AAD00107096	You? Did you re-direct the power stream back to our section?
AAD00107097	We thought nobody would ever manage to get past the radiation, and the ghouls!
AAD00107098	We owe you our freedom, outlander. Please, if there's anything we can do for you...
AAD00107099	Yes, I believe that, outlander. We owe you our freedom.
AAD00107100	As I said, I saved you from being trapped down in Vault 34.
AAD00107101	Tell me about weapon mods and special ammo.
AAD00107102	Weapon mods are things like silencers, scopes, bigger magazines.
AAD00107103	Special ammo includes things like armor-piercing bullets which don't hurt the target as much but let you punch through armor easier.
AAD00107104	There's also hollow point bullets which have the opposite effect - you can kill unarmored targets easier, but they don't do shit against armor.
AAD00107105	Where should I look for spare parts?
AAD00107106	Ha! If we had spare parts, do you think I'd be asking you to fix the damn things? That's rich.
AAD00107107	No, we ran out of spares a while back, and Jack and I have been doing our best to patch the arrays up as best we can. Sadly, we're at our wits' end.
AAD00107108	There have to be spare parts somewhere around the wasteland, but I just don't know where to direct you. You may have noticed we don't get out much.
AAD00107109	<Lie> I'll need all the medical supplies you can spare for an injured man down by the highway.
AAD00107110	Are you sure? What kind of injuries are we talking about?
AAD00107111	Has this person's condition worsened? What are the symptoms?
AAD00107112	The Powder Gangers need you to donate some supplies to them.
AAD00107113	What? Why the hell would I want to do that?
AAD00107114	This again. What makes you think I've changed my mind?
AAD00107115	Just mad ramblings. He didn't make much sense.
AAD00107116	I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
AAD00107117	VDialogueVeronicaAcceleratorChokept
AAD00107118	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again - no one did.
AAD00107119	How did they end up here?
AAD00107120	Well, they unloaded what they had left on the Dino Bite as a tax write-off. But that was before my time.
AAD00107121	Plenty of demand for them, seeing as how they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
AAD00107122	CliffBriscoeBarterFail
AAD00107123	[FAILED] Are you kidding me? I can't ship these things fast enough. People love them!
AAD00107124	But... the price tag seems so excessive on the souvenir rockets. Could you make it lower?
AAD00107125	Tell me about the Rangers.
AAD00107126	They're the NCR's finest. A one-man platoon, each of 'em.
AAD00107127	You got a job where even thinking about it would scare a man senseless, that's when you bring in the Rangers.
AAD00107128	And if you see a squad of veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
AAD00107129	RangerAndyStationCompletion
AAD00107130	Tell you what. I'll pay you for what you did, but I'll do you one better, too.
AAD00107131	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
AAD00107132	Let me show you how it's done.
AAD00107133	What did you do?
AAD00107134	I go to grab him out of there and I notice he's holding something in his hand. Something metal.
AAD00107135	He shuts himself back in the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
AAD00107136	They do it a lot, the Legion. Using kids. They know we'll hesitate.
AAD00107137	Anyway, that was the first time. Second time I fell down those stairs in front of the motel. Just in case I got to thinking I'd put it all behind me.
AAD00107138	Hey, just because you're idle and you'll never walk again... I forgot where I was going with that.
AAD00107139	[FAILED] I'm sure it was very inspiring.
AAD00107140	<Lie> I think the attackers were dead too... so it's... hard to tell.
AAD00107141	[FAILED] In Ranger school, they teach you how to spot a liar. I don't know why you're lying, but have it your way. We'll protect this town or die trying.
AAD00107142	One of those men shot me. I need to know the best way to get to them.
AAD00107143	Well, for that, your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
AAD00107144	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
AAD00107145	He may have heard where they were going.
AAD00107146	Deputy Beagle would have been your best bet, before he met that tragic end.
AAD00107147	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
AAD00107148	Maybe you can track down whatever notes he was keeping and find something to help you there.
AAD00107149	Who was the Master?
AAD00107150	Oh, he was a nasty man, dearie. You don't want to know about him. He was the one who made that Super Mutant army I told you about.
AAD00107151	Where did you come from?
AAD00107152	I grew up in Vault 17. I never even saw the sun until I was 75 years old - that was when Super Mutants raided the Vault and carried a lot of us off.
AAD00107153	Yes, Leo, I'm getting to that part! They made me one of them, and they put me to work in an army that was going to conquer California.
AAD00107154	VCassLocationRedRock
AAD00107155	God, you can smell the Brahmin shit from the Jet all over this place.
AAD00107156	VCassLocationJacobstown
AAD00107157	Can't believe we're in a refuge for crazy Super Mutants.
AAD00107158	Can you spare any medical supplies?
AAD00107159	You've done right by us, so I suppose I could spare some supplies.
AAD00107160	We've recently started making our own stimpaks, but we just don't have the materials to make other meds. Sorry about the lack of selection.
AAD00107161	What needs to be done?
AAD00107162	Well, they gotta go, or this'll be a ghost town before long.
AAD00107163	Doesn't matter to me what you do. As long as the ghouls are out of there, that's good enough for me.
AAD00107164	That's all I needed to know.
AAD00107165	Glad I could help.
AAD00107166	Hey, I know you've got no reason to help me out now, but you seem really nice. Could I at least tell you about the problem we've got here?
AAD00107167	EDERadioConversation
AAD00107168	Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
AAD00107169	I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
AAD00107170	This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
AAD00107171	Hi, sorry to break in, he sounded truly riveting. I don't want to keep you much longer, but I'd like to make a counter suggestion.
AAD00107172	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... people.
AAD00107173	Bring your robot to us. We'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
AAD00107174	I already found all three patrols. They were all dead.
AAD00107175	I suppose I am not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
AAD00107176	Initiate Stanton told me about your little adventure the other day.
AAD00107177	That was so much fun! The wind whipping through our hair, not knowing what was going to jump out at us at any moment.
AAD00107178	And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line them up and then squeeze the trigger.
AAD00107179	I doubt I'll be able to get Stanton to go with me again, though. I thought he'd enjoy it as much as I did, but he was just scared the whole time.
AAD00107180	Don't tell him I told you this, but when those scorpions surrounded us, I'd bet a week's rations he pissed himself!
AAD00107181	Show me what you have for sale.
AAD00107182	Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
AAD00107183	So you and McNamara both know about this?
AAD00107184	What would an Elder have to do to get kicked out?
AAD00107185	So you've been talking to Hardin, eh? He's been looking for a way to usurp McNamara ever since the lockdown started.
AAD00107186	Don't get me wrong, he's a good man, but Elder McNamara's done all right by us. If it weren't for him, none of us would have survived at HELIOS.
AAD00107187	I'll tell you what I told Hardin. There have been only a few cases of Elders being dismissed from their posts in the Brotherhood's history.
AAD00107188	And those involved crimes that someone like Elder McNamara is just not capable of. You can look it up for yourself, if you want.
AAD00107189	I'll grant you access to that portion of the history section of our datastore. See Senior Scribe Ibsen about accessing it.
AAD00107190	Was Initiate Watkins the "pet" you were referring to earlier?
AAD00107191	She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions towards her aren't quite so innocent.
AAD00107192	Sure, go ahead.
AAD00107193	As you may have already heard, this entire base is under a state of lockdown. No one goes out except small patrols at night.
AAD00107194	Most of the chapter has been sealed in here for years, and those few who were outside when the lockdown was initiated are forbidden from returning.
AAD00107195	Morale has plummeted as time has gone by, and many of our current paladins haven't seen combat outside of training simulations.
AAD00107196	And all because of the Elder's explicit order that no one be allowed in or out. The only way things will change is if a new Elder is installed.
AAD00107197	What can you tell me about the Legion?
AAD00107198	Slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble. They dress up like Roman soldiers, so there's no mistaking it when you see them.
AAD00107199	The rumor is, is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
AAD00107200	Please, just leave me alone.
AAD00107201	Just leave me alone.
AAD00107202	You're asking for leniency from us? Are you crazy?! We show up when the talking's over, get it?
AAD00107203	What did I do to the NCR?
AAD00107204	You've got yourself a bad reputation with us - that's what.
AAD00107205	You set me up. Now you die.
AAD00107206	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
AAD00107207	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
AAD00107208	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
AAD00107209	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
AAD00107210	What do you know about the courier Benny shot?
AAD00107211	That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter!
AAD00107212	Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip - just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't!
AAD00107213	Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them?
AAD00107214	I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?
AAD00107215	EDERadioConversation3
AAD00107216	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I monitored a communication earlier between you and someone with the Brotherhood of Steel.
AAD00107217	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... people.
AAD00107218	Bring your robot to us. We'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
AAD00107219	I could use a bed and some supplies.
AAD00107220	This is too big to be a coincidence, robot - what's your angle?
AAD00107221	Now don't go getting all paranoid, pardner - that bullet to your brain-pan probably just bucked your Brahmin a little. We're all friends here.
AAD00107222	Goodbye.
AAD00107223	Just stay out of my way, robot.
AAD00107224	I'll let that slide seeing as how you gotta mind full of vengeance for that no-good polecat and all.
AAD00107225	VDiaTheStripSS4MPBFuckThis
AAD00107226	Hey... Hey! Where the hell are you going? Well, fuck you, then!
AAD00107227	VDiaTheStripSS4MPBCurse02
AAD00107228	Hey, talk to Pappas if you've got complaints. I just want to be done with this shit.
AAD00107229	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
AAD00107230	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
AAD00107231	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
AAD00107232	I'll see what I can do.
AAD00107233	That'll have to do. I'd recommend going to see Ramos first. As head of security, he's more familiar with our protocols than anyone else here.
AAD00107234	You could also try to find something relevant in our datastore, though last I heard, Scribe Ibsen is having a bit of a problem accessing it.
AAD00107235	And if McNamara should give you any tasks, I'd ask that you kept me abreast of them.
AAD00107236	Report anything you find to me, and we'll move from there.
AAD00107237	You see what happened in there?
AAD00107238	Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looks all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
AAD00107239	Did you see Benny come this way?
AAD00107240	Fancy-pants? No, I ain't seen hide-nor-hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings. I'm sure he ran back to the soft living of New Vegas, though.
AAD00107241	What was that recording you were listening to?
AAD00107242	Oh, that old thing? That's just a holotape from the last time I visited my grandkids. Such sweet little children, you know. Little angels.
AAD00107243	Sometimes it's hard to remember them, so I take that old tape out from time to time and listen.
AAD00107244	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat. Have you seen anyone like that?
AAD00107245	Well, he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of gentleman to me.
AAD00107246	Had his nose stuck so high in the air, you couldn't see it above the clouds. City folk, they always think they deserve better than what they got.
AAD00107247	Those hoodlums he was with seemed to know Manny for some reason. He's our daytime sniper, up in the dinosaur's mouth.
AAD00107248	Can't say I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
AAD00107249	Maybe ask Jeannie May. Nothing happens in this town that she don't know about. She'll be up in the lobby, most days.
AAD00107250	Sure have. Camouflage, that coat was, trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers.
AAD00107251	But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
AAD00107252	They stayed here a night, and was up by the dinosaur talking to the sniper fella with the moustache a couple of times.
AAD00107253	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs, if that's what you're wondering. Sounded like he didn't have his money with him.
AAD00107254	His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
AAD00107255	Manny might know more about them. Thought he might've been friends with one or two of 'em. He's up in the dino mouth during the day.
AAD00107256	No, but I've been laid up for a while now. Haven't been able to keep an eye on things like usual.
AAD00107257	It's a small town, though. I'm sure someone would've noticed somebody like that if they came this way.
AAD00107258	Can I get a code to use the VR pods in the mess hall?
AAD00107259	No. Those aren't for outsiders to use. Leave them alone.
AAD00107260	Glad to have helped.
AAD00107261	Hey, I'd better get rolling. Jack and I have a lot of work ahead of us!
AAD00107262	<Intelligence>
AAD00107263	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly. We'll be shelling an unoccupied location in Outer Vegas to get their attention elsewhere.
AAD00107264	By the time they realize they aren't under attack, the plane and the bots will be long gone.
AAD00107265	The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it's wise not to start up a war just as the Lady has risen.
AAD00107266	Are you planning to use diversionary tactics to draw their attention?
AAD00107267	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
AAD00107268	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
AAD00107269	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel. It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
AAD00107270	Please, enjoy your stay.
AAD00107271	Sure, here you go.
AAD00107272	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
AAD00107273	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel. It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
AAD00107274	Please, enjoy your stay.
AAD00107275	Okay, you can take it for a little while.
AAD00107276	Can you tell me about the Followers?
AAD00107277	vDialogueYesManSecuritronUpgrade
AAD00107278	All of this is old hat, right?
AAD00107279	New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
AAD00107280	What are you talking about?
AAD00107281	You remember how the Securitron army at the Fort got destroyed? For very, very good reasons, of course...
AAD00107282	Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
AAD00107283	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
AAD00107284	What sort of options?
AAD00107285	You could route the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
AAD00107286	That'll wake up the Securitron army you left on standby and give us enough force to push the Legion and the NCR straight out of the Mojave!
AAD00107287	The other option is destroy the dam's generators. Without those, it's just a big bunch of concrete! The NCR won't have any reason to stick around!
AAD00107288	You don't have to decide yet! For now, all you have to do is take this override module and install it on the terminal in the power control room!
AAD00107289	Good luck! See you at the dam!
AAD00107290	I'd like to rent a room.
AAD00107291	Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least until the busy season comes. Sound good?
AAD00107292	You would establish a foothold in the region and be one step closer to rebuilding the Mojave.
AAD00107293	I think I see now what you intend to set in motion.
AAD00107294	If this plan will bring us one step closer to revitalizing the region, you can count on our support.
AAD00107295	So long as you keep us supplied, we will stay in the Mojave to provide care and education for those in need.
AAD00107296	Why don't you come with me?
AAD00107297	I can't leave now. Caesar has gained too much ground. I need to be here in case the NCR fails to hold Hoover Dam.
AAD00107298	No offense intended, but why should I go anywhere with you?
AAD00107299	Maybe my weak and flimsy hands can massage that out for you. <Apply Sleeper Hold>
AAD00107300	What happens if I hang around one of your camps?
AAD00107301	Then we'll have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
AAD00107302	I'll keep that in mind.
AAD00107303	See ya.
AAD00107304	<Speech Options>
AAD00107305	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you look to be a trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
AAD00107306	You can tell me or you can rot in here.
AAD00107307	Can you tell me about the people who passed through town now?
AAD00107308	Indeed I do good sir, and I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
AAD00107309	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
AAD00107310	My good lady, I believe I may have some information that would prove useful.
AAD00107311	If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share that information I have with you.
AAD00107312	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
AAD00107313	I'm in quite a state here. If you help me with my bonds I'll be more than happy to tell you anything, and everything about those Khans.
AAD00107314	Ahh yes, my memory is much clearer now that I am free from my bondage.
AAD00107315	I was sku... er, performing recon, gathering information on some of the Powder Gangers, when some Great Khans arrived with your friend in the suit.
AAD00107316	They were talking about some delivery they took from a courier, I assume that was you.
AAD00107317	They said they'd be heading through Nipton to Novac to meet a contact there.
AAD00107318	Can you tell me about the man in the checkered suit who came through here?
AAD00107319	Anything you can say to her, you can say to me.
AAD00107320	You don't want us chatting, trust me. As for the girl - I just want to talk to her.
AAD00107321	And if you can't bring her here, then you're no use to me - or Gloria. So if you want to cause trouble in here over nothing, then go on - try.
AAD00107322	Raise that gun, and I'll kill everyone in here.
AAD00107323	You know what, I think you mean that. All right... maybe...
AAD00107324	VEndingCourierFemale
AAD00107325	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
AAD00107326	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
AAD00107327	I'm not actually armed.
AAD00107328	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
AAD00107329	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
AAD00107330	What about Primm Slim? Could he be sheriff?
AAD00107331	Well I guess I never thought of that. I guess he could be sheriff, if you think he could be reprogrammed for it.
AAD00107332	Well I reckon he could be a sheriff if you have the skills to reprogram him.
AAD00107333	Do you think Primm Slim could be sheriff?
AAD00107334	VikkiVanceCasinoManagerTopic
AAD00107335	You're the luckiest player I've ever seen. Keep up the good work in here.
AAD00107336	Ted's been kidnapped. He's here in the hotel.
AAD00107337	He's here? Bless you, I thought he was a goner for sure.
AAD00107338	Listen, you do what you gotta do to find him. I'd send my men with you but I'm worried they'd kill Ted if we got close.
AAD00107339	Reckon you might need one of these. Take it. Just don't wave it around here where they might take it from you.
AAD00107340	Why is the NCR interested in this desert?
AAD00107341	It is no secret. Our interest here is twofold.
AAD00107342	First, we want to remain in control of Hoover Dam. It supplies the Republic with power, and is a source of fresh water.
AAD00107343	Second, we want to prevent the Legion from advancing across the Colorado River and endangering the home states.
AAD00107344	What's the New California Republic?
AAD00107345	An odd combination.
AAD00107346	REPCONN went through some rough times. When their rocket business was shaky, Mr. House purchased the company.
AAD00107347	It didn't take long for him to repurpose their plasma technology for a government weapon contract.
AAD00107348	Ugh. Well, if you're going to be like that then never mind.
AAD00107349	Things are bad around here. I'd like to make a difference, and I'd like you to help me.
AAD00107350	Hmm. That seems appropriately resolute and yet vague. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and go with you, but let me be clear about something.
AAD00107351	If you plan to help Caesar's Legion, this is going to be a brief relationship.
AAD00107352	I may not have all the answers for how to fix Freeside's problems, but Caesar taking control isn't part of the solution. Fair?
AAD00107353	The NCR oppression around here would disappear if the Legion took control. I could use your help.
AAD00107354	Only because everyone would be conscripted or enslaved. And the people who are unfit for military service or slavery would be put down. Swell plan.
AAD00107355	Yes, a veritable Pax Romana for post-nuclear America. My political beliefs are a bit more progressive than outright fascism, so I'll pass. Thanks.
AAD00107356	If New Vegas can remain independent, I'm going to find a way to do it. I could use your help.
AAD00107357	If that's really what you're trying to do, I'll go with you.
AAD00107358	Things are hectic around here, but it won't mean anything if NCR or the Legion take control. I'm sure the Followers can manage without me.
AAD00107359	Just don't try to help the Legion, and we shouldn't have any problems. Sound good?
AAD00107360	I'm trying to help Mr. House keep New Vegas independent.
AAD00107361	That's funny. Mr. House doesn't want to keep New Vegas independent. He just wants to keep the NCR and Caesar's Legion from pushing him around.
AAD00107362	He must be pretty convincing if he's roped you into helping him, but you can count me out.
AAD00107363	The NCR needs help against the Legion before Caesar moves on the dam. We could use your skills.
AAD00107364	The NCR had a chance to use the Followers' skills before, but being imperialists mattered more to them. No thanks.
AAD00107365	The Elder tasked me with contacting several scouts out in the waste.
AAD00107366	That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liaison.
AAD00107367	I've been trying to get the Elder to send out scouts for years, and he's always been resistant to the idea. Said they'd be a vulnerability.
AAD00107368	I wonder what changed his mind.
AAD00107369	Just give the details.
AAD00107370	The items I'll need to keep the system running are a differential pressure controller, a reverse pulse cleaner, and several HEPA cartridge filters.
AAD00107371	At present, my best guess for finding the items would be to search any of the old vaults in the area.
AAD00107372	Those vaults were usually built much like these military bunkers, even using the same contractors in their constructions at times.
AAD00107373	I'll mark the vaults' locations on your map. Best of luck to you.
AAD00107374	One of the datastore entries mentioned the Chain That Binds. What is that, exactly?
AAD00107375	That's an old, old principle that's been around since the Brotherhood was founded. It basically means that you have to obey a superior officer.
AAD00107376	It's pretty much common sense, but it gets invoked a lot when people get pissy about following orders.
AAD00107377	If you're curious, I'll give you access to the datastore entry on it. You'd probably be the first to read it in years, if not decades.
AAD00107378	I convinced him that staying here was more dangerous than moving on.
AAD00107379	Yes, you exploited his fear of Powder Gangers very effectively. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
AAD00107380	He'll keep his distance, setting ambushes, never suspecting that these bunkers house something far more dangerous to him than criminals. Well-played.
AAD00107381	No, not really.
AAD00107382	The desert can play tricks on a man's mind. Don't let it bother you much.
AAD00107383	You have to get out of here.
AAD00107384	Now why would I do that? You see some Powder Gangers on the approach or something?
AAD00107385	
AAD00107386	[SUCCEEDED] You've seen that with your own two eyes?
AAD00107387	Goddamn, I knew Cooke's gang passed through these parts 'bout that frequently, but I didn't know they holed up here.
AAD00107388	Be a rude awakening, to find fifteen of those merciless bastards looking down at me snoozing on my bedroll!
AAD00107389	Yep, I'd be better off setting up an ambush along one of their routes to catch stragglers. Thanks for the information. You may've saved my life.
AAD00107390	<Lie> Powder Gangers use these bunkers as hideouts once or twice a month.
AAD00107391	Nothing, I swear.
AAD00107392	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
AAD00107393	HVRangerMessWithRadio
AAD00107394	You just had to go messing with my radio again, didn't you?
AAD00107395	What are Powder Gangers?
AAD00107396	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
AAD00107397	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
AAD00107398	So far the brass haven't mustered up enough men to take the prison back. Long overdue if you ask me. But I'm just one man.
AAD00107399	Would you like to come with me? I could use someone skilled in medicine.
AAD00107400	You've helped the Followers, but your reputation isn't exactly spotless. How do I know you're not going to lose it out there?
AAD00107401	Here's my proposition. If you want to work together to help the people around here, I'll lend a hand. If you start acting like a crazy waster...
AAD00107402	Where did you get your medical training?
AAD00107403	The Followers taught me everything I know about medicine. Despite our humble abode here in New Vegas, we have great facilities back in the NCR.
AAD00107404	We may have overextended ourselves by setting up camp in Freeside, but the people here need help from someone. If not us, who?
AAD00107405	I'd like you to come with me.
AAD00107406	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
AAD00107407	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
AAD00107408	What are you talking about?
AAD00107409	I wasn't always with the Followers, or with the NCR.
AAD00107410	My late father was an officer in a group called the Enclave, a remnant of America's Pre-War government.
AAD00107411	Memories being short around here, not a whole lot of people remember them. But they did bad things. Terrorized communities, kidnapped people.
AAD00107412	Eventually, someone stopped them. I was born a few years later at a military base on the coast, a place called Navarro.
AAD00107413	Sure.
AAD00107414	Any day now, Caesar's going to try to march across Hoover Dam and kick NCR out of the Mojave.
AAD00107415	We're getting caught up in something important out here. Hell, after how you handled Benny, you're practically right in the middle of all this.
AAD00107416	I know I'm just along for the ride, but it's made me think about the past, and how I might be able to help out.
AAD00107417	I've taken care of the Van Graffs.
AAD00107418	Well done. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's damn good to move forward again. Now, I believe congratulations are in order.
AAD00107419	It is my honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for your meritorious service in its name.
AAD00107420	Normally, there'd be a ceremony and such, but everyone is too busy at the moment for such frivolity.
AAD00107421	I can give you this, however. Your very own suit of power armor. We can't spare our best, but I had the knights assemble this one for your use.
AAD00107422	Which reminds me, you don't even know how to use these, do you?
AAD00107423	Yes, what is the task?
AAD00107424	Back when we were stationed at HELIOS, our scouts reported that a group was establishing itself in the area as a distributor of Pre-War weapons.
AAD00107425	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, was too concerned with getting HELIOS running and fending off the NCR, so he ordered us to leave them alone.
AAD00107426	It's time that we correct that oversight, and show this region that the Brotherhood is still a force to be reckoned with.
AAD00107427	I want you to visit these weapons dealers, this Van Graff family, and make an example of them. Leave no one alive.
AAD00107428	When the job is done, report back and I'll arrange for a team to clean up the site and retrieve the weapons.
AAD00107429	Is there anything else for me to do?
AAD00107430	No, your role in this is done. The rest is up to us. There is much more for me to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.
AAD00107431	Come back in a few days, and I should be firmly installed as Elder.
AAD00107432	How do you know so much about this, again?
AAD00107433	Stop thinking so much. Thanks.
AAD00107434	I installed the device up at Black Mountain, as instructed.
AAD00107435	Yes, we've already started receiving telemetry from it. This will be a great help in our future efforts, and I thank you.
AAD00107436	Now then, it is my great honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for meritorious service above and beyond the call of duty.
AAD00107437	I'm afraid a formal ceremony was out of the question given our current state, but I hope this will make up for it.
AAD00107438	I had the knights refurbish a suit of our power armor for your use. It's one of the earlier models, but it should serve you well.
AAD00107439	Now, I suppose I'm going to have to show you how to use it, aren't I?
AAD00107440	Yes, what is the task?
AAD00107441	As one of our patrols discovered, the mutants just to the northeast have become strangely violent in the years we were secluded.
AAD00107442	However, this turn of events could also be an opportunity. We mostly left the equipment of the communications array there alone, out of respect.
AAD00107443	As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will be accorded them, making their equipment fair game.
AAD00107444	I want you to head up to the summit of Black Mountain and install this remote signal transmitter in one of their consoles.
AAD00107445	It will allow us to tap into the radar and other detection systems running there, assuming they're still operational.
AAD00107446	If we're going to operate on the surface again, it would be nice to do so with as much information at our fingertips as possible. Good luck.
AAD00107447	Any work around here?
AAD00107448	Nothing I know of, but if you've come from the North, means you can travel freer than most around here.
AAD00107449	Might check the Barracks, someone might need you to hoof it somewhere. Just be careful if you go up on the roof - got a sniper watching the road.
AAD00107450	If your gear's in need of repair, HQ's also worth checking out - talk to Major Knight, he can help. Provided you got a pen and plenty of ink.
AAD00107451	Tell me about the lockdown.
AAD00107452	It's a protective measure that was enacted after our defeat at HELIOS. The NCR was hot on our heels, and we wouldn't have survived another encounter.
AAD00107453	It was decided that we would stay quiet for a time, heal the wounded, and try to come up with a new strategy.
AAD00107454	However, after we had fully recuperated, our first scouting measures showed that the NCR's presence in this region had only increased in our absence.
AAD00107455	There are now more than five times the number of NCR troops in the area as when we fought them, and we have half the number we did at HELIOS.
AAD00107456	And so the lockdown has been extended. To go outside would be the death of us all.
AAD00107457	I thought you were interested in preserving life.
AAD00107458	I know I shouldn't place one life below another, but in Caesar's case, I'll make an exception.
AAD00107459	The whole "slavery and cultural annihilation" stance he's adopted is a bit repugnant to me.
AAD00107460	Though I guess what I think never really mattered much to you, did it?
AAD00107461	You didn't tell me your name.
AAD00107462	Oh - Knight. You must not be from around here. If so... it doesn't do to get too friendly.
AAD00107463	What?
AAD00107464	Just need something for the log book, keeping tabs on traffic through the Outpost... although mostly just in, not out these days.
AAD00107465	If you're looking for the commanding officer, he's in the back. Although... he's got a lot on his plate, so if you speak with him... keep it short.
AAD00107466	Also, if you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
AAD00107467	What do you have for trade?
AAD00107468	For you? Hmm. I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
AAD00107469	You've certainly done your part.
AAD00107470	I've been wondering about Daisy and the others for so long, I still haven't figured out what I should do.
AAD00107471	I mean, I'm not like them. I was born at Navarro and my father served with them, but I wasn't really part of the Enclave.
AAD00107472	It seems presumptuous of me to think I could join the fight, even if this is a cause worth fighting for.
AAD00107473	Because I know when fighting breaks out at the dam, all hell is going to break loose in Freeside. They're going to need every doctor they can get.
AAD00107474	That's their story, Arcade, not yours.
AAD00107475	It seems pointless to do all of that without a goal.
AAD00107476	I'm sure Henry has goals. He was just more concerned with the "how" than the "why" of things. Being in the Enclave didn't really mean much to him.
AAD00107477	I guess I'm lucky that I'm part of the Followers. Helping people as a doctor is important, but with the Followers, it feels different.
AAD00107478	It feels like we're working toward something more important. That's more than the sum of the good deeds that we do.
AAD00107479	Some people can't stop reliving their glory days.
AAD00107480	Not much glory in the Enclave. Most of her old comrades are long gone.
AAD00107481	I know life as a salvager can't compare to being a vertibird pilot but... at least it's a life. That has to count for something.
AAD00107482	It was an important part of her life. Why shouldn't she enjoy it?
AAD00107483	As screwed up as it sounds, at least she was a part of something. Granted, it was something... admittedly, pretty bad, but it was something.
AAD00107484	If you spent the first half of your life flying Enclave troopers in a vertibird, I suppose picking over Pre-War rocket parts doesn't quite compare.
AAD00107485	VStripLucky38ExitSceneWow02
AAD00107486	What? Are you serious? I've got to see that!
AAD00107487	Where would I find a diagnostic scanning module?
AAD00107488	It's been said that the Auto-Docs were standard equipment in the underground Vaults where mankind survived when the bombs fell centuries ago.
AAD00107489	You can search the Vaults, but every Auto-Doc my Legion has run across has been stripped for parts long before we found it.
AAD00107490	Some of my scouts did report an abandoned Vault near Nellis Air Force Base. Overrun by ghouls, they said.
AAD00107491	Maybe the infestation has been there long enough to keep scavengers out. Why don't you go and see?
AAD00107492	[Speech Check 65+]
AAD00107493	[SUCCEEDED] Then go find some proper Surgical Tools. The medication from a Doctor's Bag might come in handy, too.
AAD00107494	I'll make sure you're allowed to bring the necessary medications into the camp. Hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
AAD00107495	It's a simple procedure... as brain surgeries go.
AAD00107496	[Medicine options]
AAD00107497	[SUCCEEDED] I don't- I don't know... There have been a couple...
AAD00107498	You just experienced an Absence Seizure. Was this the first time?
AAD00107499	What about the White Glove Society?
AAD00107500	I was saying that I'd planned to ask you to forge an alliance with them, but you've killed their leaders.
AAD00107501	By the time the White Gloves sort themselves out, the battle for Hoover Dam will have come and gone. So, on to the next matter at hand...
AAD00107502	[Medicine responses]
AAD00107503	[FAILED] Fuck off.
AAD00107504	You don't look so good.
AAD00107505	Who is this Legatus you mention?
AAD00107506	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
AAD00107507	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
AAD00107508	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
AAD00107509	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
AAD00107510	Tell me about Caesar.
AAD00107511	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
AAD00107512	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
AAD00107513	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
AAD00107514	How can I serve the Legion?
AAD00107515	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
AAD00107516	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
AAD00107517	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
AAD00107518	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
AAD00107519	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AAD00107520	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
AAD00107521	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
AAD00107522	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AAD00107523	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
AAD00107524	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
AAD00107525	You captured everyone?
AAD00107526	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
AAD00107527	I told them that when the Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
AAD00107528	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
AAD00107529	What exactly happened here?
AAD00107530	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
AAD00107531	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers - or men of the Legion. The people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
AAD00107532	For a pittance, the great Vulpes Inculta inveigled this town to lead those it had sheltered into a trap.
AAD00107533	Only when it was sprung did they realize they were caught inside it, too. I only wish Vulpes had lived to see the scheme come to fruition.
AAD00107534	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
AAD00107535	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
AAD00107536	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
AAD00107537	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
AAD00107538	What "lessons" did you teach here?
AAD00107539	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AAD00107540	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AAD00107541	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
AAD00107542	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
AAD00107543	Who are you?
AAD00107544	I am Gabban, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the one of his Frumentarii.
AAD00107545	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
AAD00107546	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
AAD00107547	Legionaries - we have a problem!
AAD00107548	I've brought a doctor, Arcade Gannon, who can take care of Caesar. He's outside.
AAD00107549	Very well. I'll have him seized and brought to Caesar as his personal physician.
AAD00107550	So shall I have him seized or not?
AAD00107551	Goodbye.
AAD00107552	Yes, goodbye.
AAD00107553	VFSOrrisSecondRun
AAD00107554	So tell me, did you really think I'd be stupid enough to fall for this again? One of my men saw you go in and out of the Kings' place.
AAD00107555	As much as I hate to lose a customer, it's just unavoidable sometimes.
AAD00107556	Here's the chip.
AAD00107557	The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission. Otherwise, we can return to Cottonwood Cove.
AAD00107558	Here you go.
AAD00107559	You're free to leave. The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission.
AAD00107560	Yes. Return what you took from me.
AAD00107561	Done.
AAD00107562	The password is "The better part of valor."
AAD00107563	[You hear static.]
AAD00107564	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
AAD00107565	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look you over. Oh, and welcome back.
AAD00107566	The password is "And to dare to do it."
AAD00107567	[You hear static.]
AAD00107568	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
AAD00107569	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look you over. Oh, and welcome back.
AAD00107570	Seems like you pop up everywhere, Victor.
AAD00107571	Aw shucks, pardner. I suppose it can't hurt to let you in on my little secret!
AAD00107572	Old Victor wouldn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, I can move from one to another with the snap of a finger!
AAD00107573	Pretty nice trick, ain't it? Just don't ask me how I do it, because I don't know!
AAD00107574	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, I agree to disarm.
AAD00107575	<Give Sammy the key from Canyon Runner>
AAD00107576	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the Legion or Frank.
AAD00107577	<Speech more money>
AAD00107578	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AAD00107579	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here. 50/50 and I'm game.
AAD00107580	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AAD00107581	Twenty-five percent?! Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
AAD00107582	<Barter>
AAD00107583	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
AAD00107584	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
AAD00107585	This kind of work costs time and money. 50/50 would cover my expenses.
AAD00107586	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
AAD00107587	Are you crazy?! I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
AAD00107588	I don't think either of us can fully understand what he and the tribes have gone through.
AAD00107589	A fair point, but from the perspective of someone west of the Colorado, the man is clearly out of his mind.
AAD00107590	Maybe he didn't intend for things to wind up this way, but that doesn't mean he needs to perpetuate this bizarre anachronistic myth.
AAD00107591	And it doesn't mean that we should sit by and nod our heads at every absurd faux-Roman casus belli he can dream up.
AAD00107592	He's a tyrant. The bad kind. And there's no way we're letting him take Hoover Dam.
AAD00107593	He's a madman. What did you expect?
AAD00107594	Well, yeah! Right. What did I expect? The man's a megalomaniac. He acts like this is some pre-ordained cycle we're returning to.
AAD00107595	Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off a cliff.
AAD00107596	Instead of trying to learn from the past, he re-creates it, runs back over the same old barren ground.
AAD00107597	He seemed pretty smart to me.
AAD00107598	Being "smart" doesn't matter if you're insane. Everything makes sense to Caesar because he's twisted everything to his world view.
AAD00107599	He's Caesar reincarnated, the NCR is the corrupt Roman senate. I wouldn't be surprised if he thought the Colorado River were the new Rubicon.
AAD00107600	He abdicates responsibility to a myth of historical inevitability. But he's not Caesar. This isn't Rome. And he isn't going to get away with this.
AAD00107601	That was just talk. It's not the same for you.
AAD00107602	No, I think it is the same for me. Maybe for a different reason, but... you can't hold on to a past you've never had.
AAD00107603	For better or worse, I am not my father. I never had a life with the Enclave, and it would be silly for me to try to start one now.
AAD00107604	I'll stay with you until the Legion moves on the dam, but once the attack starts, I'm going to have to go to back to Freeside. It's where I belong.
AAD00107605	I need to take care of something, but I'll see you soon enough. Thanks for all of your help. It means a lot to me.
AAD00107606	You aren't like the others, Arcade. You're still young. It's up to you to decide who you want to be.
AAD00107607	True enough. Maybe I can't fill my father's shoes. I wouldn't even know how.
AAD00107608	But if following in his footsteps for a while means I can do some good out here, I'll do my best.
AAD00107609	I need to go do something. I won't be gone long, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
AAD00107610	Is the Enclave's treatment by the Brotherhood influencing your opinion?
AAD00107611	Some of the old-timers like Moreno hold grudges against the Brotherhood and the NCR. I'd like to think I'm above that, but you may be right.
AAD00107612	I'm not going to pout and cry if you give it to the Brotherhood. I'd rather they have it than allow all that knowledge to disappear.
AAD00107613	I'd just prefer that it go to an organization like the Followers, who are less likely to use it for... violent purposes.
AAD00107614	ArcadeEDEEnclave
AAD00107615	Wow. That thing is definitely carrying around a bunch of Enclave intel. Adams is on the eastern seaboard of the country.
AAD00107616	Which means that little "Duraframe" sucker somehow managed to survive for over two thousand miles. Certainly lives up to its model name.
AAD00107617	What are you going to do now?
AAD00107618	Back to Old Mormon Fort, where I can do some good. We Followers may be idealistic but even I know this is going to end in blood.
AAD00107619	Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
AAD00107620	Thanks, I guess.
AAD00107621	I have to admit, I did not expect that sort of response.
AAD00107622	This is one of the last surviving suits of original-issue Tesla armor from Navarro and it was worn by my father but... yeah I guess it's no big deal.
AAD00107623	Good luck at Hoover Dam. I'll uh... be going now, I guess.
AAD00107624	I'm honored.
AAD00107625	It's the least I could do. All I ask is that you put it to good use. This place has lived in the shadow of Caesar for long enough.
AAD00107626	I may not be the one to help stop him here, but you are. Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
AAD00107627	KeithResponse
AAD00107628	Fuck you man, I ain't going nowhere with you.
AAD00107629	Why don't you go cry to your wife, then - oh, that's right! She left your worthless stinking ass!
AAD00107630	RNVMusic
AAD00107631	
AAD00107632	Do you mind if I try to fix it?
AAD00107633	You're welcome to try. It's yours if you can get it working.
AAD00107634	If I had my way I'd dump it in the scrapyard in Novac and be done with the damn thing.
AAD00107635	What is wrong with it?
AAD00107636	Hell if I know. I don't think it's serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.
AAD00107637	Why can't you protect them?
AAD00107638	We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts, and even if we did, we need some extra hands for backup.
AAD00107639	You should talk to Lieutenant Hayes. He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
AAD00107640	Shouldn't you be protecting the town or something?
AAD00107641	We'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction. Even if they did, we're in no shape to protect them.
AAD00107642	I thought you were dead.
AAD00107643	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
AAD00107644	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
AAD00107645	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
AAD00107646	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
AAD00107647	Is this because I didn't upgrade that army of Securitrons under Caesar's Fort?
AAD00107648	Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - probably - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
AAD00107649	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
AAD00107650	I know Elijah needs to be dealt with, just let me handle it.
AAD00107651	NVDLC01EndingDog
AAD00107652	Dog forgot himself, as did the voice that raged within him. After their passing, a new voice spoke within the mutant's shell.
AAD00107653	It was difficult for the voice to remember the two it once was... there was the beast, Dog consumed by hunger...
AAD00107654	...and the other in reverse... the one consumed by control.
AAD00107655	Both were driven by need for the other. The Courier brought them together, somehow, joined the two into one.
AAD00107656	All that happened at the Sierra Madre, was a faint memory to the new personality... like a flickering light in the clouds of the mind.
AAD00107657	The new voice did not think of the Courier again until the battle at the Divide reached his ears.
AAD00107658	The battle between the two couriers, beneath the torn skies and the Old World flag... each bearing a message for the other.
AAD00107659	And the mutant prayed the Courier that had saved him... had been saved in return.
AAD00107660	NVDLC01EndingChristine
AAD00107661	Christine, her mission complete, found new purpose as the Sierra Madre's warden. She watched over it silently - by choice.
AAD00107662	Over time, the Ghost People came to see her as one of the Holograms. They would watch, silently, as she walked among them.
AAD00107663	At times, Christine thought of the Courier, who had kept Elijah's hand from her throat.
AAD00107664	The Courier reminded her of the other courier she had met in the Big Empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at last.
AAD00107665	She did not think of them again until she heard the legends of the Divide.
AAD00107666	The Divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the world.
AAD00107667	I need you to go down to the manual bypass room to regulate the power.
AAD00107668	[Christine glances at the elevator. Her expression becomes worried, then she looks back at you, then reluctantly shakes her head.]
AAD00107669	Fine. Get up and follow me.
AAD00107670	All right, all right... but you already have company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
AAD00107671	What are the Vending Machines all over town?
AAD00107672	Those little company stores? Sinclair's toy boxes. Put in a casino chip, get a treat, like you're some dog doing tricks.
AAD00107673	Take any of the casino chips, put 'em into the machine, and you'll get something out - a snack, a cola, something to mend a tear in your shirt.
AAD00107674	Sometimes you have to know exactly what to ask for, other times, there's codes for... eh, unconventional items. For emergencies.
AAD00107675	If your collar goes off, mine goes off. It's better if we guard each other.
AAD00107676	100 Chips for 100 Pre-War bills.
AAD00107677	[You place the bills on the counter. A panel flips, taking the bills with it... and 100 Chips appear in their place.]
AAD00107678	Collect Comps.
AAD00107679	NVDLC01GodToDeanTopic02
AAD00107680	You could have left the Sierra Madre. Left this Villa, joined your own kind.
AAD00107681	That Auto-Doc really carved you up.
AAD00107682	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods... slowly, then puts her hand in front her throat, closes it slowly, then points at you.]
AAD00107683	Those facial scars weren't done by the Auto-Doc - the throat scar was.
AAD00107684	[FAILED] [She frowns, narrows her eyes, and looks at you.]
AAD00107685	NVDLC01RadioChristineAct2
AAD00107686	[Christine frowns.] 
AAD00107687	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
AAD00107688	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
AAD00107689	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
AAD00107690	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
AAD00107691	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
AAD00107692	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
AAD00107693	<AUDIO: If the player hasn't dropped Christine off at the Gala Event and she is alone at the fountain, this will be crackling silence.>
AAD00107694	<AUDIO: After Gala Event, not Act 3 yet.>
AAD00107695	<AUDIO: If the player has left Christine at the Gala Event in a "good" way, this is the signal that will play.>
AAD00107696	<AUDIO: If the player has left Christine at Gala Event and she hates the player, she'll bang on the doors of the elevator to be let out.>
AAD00107697	[STATIC] 
AAD00107698	NVDLC01RadioChristineAct1
AAD00107699	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
AAD00107700	What's this little doll? Were you carved by a craftsman, little doll, or were you mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
AAD00107701	[STATIC] 
AAD00107702	NVDLC01RadioDeanAct3
AAD00107703	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
AAD00107704	Where the hell did everyone else go?
AAD00107705	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did? Hnh.
AAD00107706	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
AAD00107707	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
AAD00107708	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
AAD00107709	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
AAD00107710	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
AAD00107711	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
AAD00107712	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
AAD00107713	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
AAD00107714	This place... hasn't changed at all.
AAD00107715	NVDLC01RadioDeanAct2
AAD00107716	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
AAD00107717	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
AAD00107718	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
AAD00107719	Hope you've got this one under control because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
AAD00107720	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
AAD00107721	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
AAD00107722	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
AAD00107723	This is a fine how do you do.
AAD00107724	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
AAD00107725	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
AAD00107726	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
AAD00107727	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
AAD00107728	That tourist is better than most. Probably won't matter.
AAD00107729	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
AAD00107730	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
AAD00107731	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
AAD00107732	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait them out.
AAD00107733	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
AAD00107734	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
AAD00107735	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
AAD00107736	All right, now - I'm out of here.
AAD00107737	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
AAD00107738	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
AAD00107739	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
AAD00107740	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
AAD00107741	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
AAD00107742	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
AAD00107743	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here. I don't like it.
AAD00107744	NVDLC01RadioDogAct3
AAD00107745	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
AAD00107746	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
AAD00107747	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
AAD00107748	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
AAD00107749	The human did it. Good.
AAD00107750	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
AAD00107751	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
AAD00107752	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
AAD00107753	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
AAD00107754	Madre's mine.
AAD00107755	So hungry.
AAD00107756	Insides growling.

AAD00107761	NVDLC01RadioDogAct2
AAD00107762	Where are lights. Dog want to see the lights.
AAD00107763	Can't wait to see the lights.
AAD00107764	Got to go... Casin-oooo.
AAD00107765	Want show and lights and yelling to start.

AAD00107769	Please let me out.
AAD00107770	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
AAD00107771	What did I do?
AAD00107772	Lights and fire.
AAD00107773	Pretty.
AAD00107774	Lots of noise.
AAD00107775	Where is Master? Did Master make fires in the sky?
AAD00107776	:: Delighted clapping ::
AAD00107777	Nooooooooooo!

AAD00107779	Let me out, let me out!
AAD00107780	Noise hurts, noise hurts!
AAD00107781	Streets are hurting my ears!
AAD00107782	Too bright, too bright.
AAD00107783	Hurry, we're targets out here.
AAD00107784	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
AAD00107785	The Sierra Madre's almost mine.
AAD00107786	When this festival fires, I'm the first one in the door.
AAD00107787	Last time I ever deal with human trash...
AAD00107788	All this - if I get inside the Sierra Madre, it's all worth it. All of it.
AAD00107789	As soon as those collars go off... we'll settle things, yes.
AAD00107790	The human did it. Good.
AAD00107791	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
AAD00107792	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
AAD00107793	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
AAD00107794	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
AAD00107795	Madre's mine.
AAD00107796	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
AAD00107797	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
AAD00107798	Gate won't be open for long.
AAD00107799	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
AAD00107800	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
AAD00107801	NVDLC01RadioDeanAct1
AAD00107802	I don't remember you. Who are you?
AAD00107803	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
AAD00107804	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
AAD00107805	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
AAD00107806	NVDLC01RadioElijahAct3
AAD00107807	When the bombs hit, this casino sealed up like an Emperor's tomb. If you don't know what that means, never mind, it means we're trapped.
AAD00107808	So - get the power running to the main floor. That'll open the elevators and unlock the doors.
AAD00107809	The ones that didn't strip their gears when they locked into place, Old World junk. Shoddy workmanship.
AAD00107810	Once the power's on, then I'll tell you your next steps. Just get this part done, and then listen.
AAD00107811	If you're wondering where your crew is, well... the casino saw them as guests. Which means they all got assigned to their floor. Just like mine.
AAD00107812	Don't worry about them, they're of no use if you can't get the power running.
AAD00107813	All I need is you for the rest of this. Which means we just need to deal with them, one by one, and then the Vault's... ours.
AAD00107814	Ha! You got the power on, excellent. You were quite a find, glad my trap in the desert caught you before time ran out.
AAD00107815	And also glad you didn't come across this place first, might have plundered it first... can't have that. Like at HELIOS. And Hoover Dam.
AAD00107816	All right, setting this on repeat in case you're some idiot-savant braincase and need the reminder...
AAD00107817	So, my greedy friend, we've got some unfinished business. I'm not one to share, and there's loose ends we need to wrap up first.
AAD00107818	The rest of your team is on different floors. They got assigned there, ushered there based on the casino's records as to the best "fit."
AAD00107819	Don't ask me how, Pre-War casino security and escort systems aren't my specialty.
AAD00107820	Go to each floor, and kill them. I don't need them anymore... well, now that you're here.
AAD00107821	We don't need anyone... except each other. Together, we'll crack the Sierra Madre, and we can both leave this place behind.
AAD00107822	NVDLC01DeanDialogueGenericIdle
AAD00107823	The cafe survived? How about that. Had great coffee - and one of the waitresses? Rhonda? Piece. Of. Work.
AAD00107824	Breath of fresh air in here... literally. If you need to take a breather from the Cloud, this is a good spot.
AAD00107825	Might be a nice place to hole up for a while.
AAD00107826	Like a toxic ashtray down here.
AAD00107827	Find a way to get this place hopping again... would clean all the toxic gas out of Puesta del Sol.

AAD00107829	[Christine makes a sweeping motion of the room, does a deep inhalation, then gives a thumbs up.]
AAD00107830	[Christine's breathing quickens, and her eyes dart around the walls.]
AAD00107831	[Christine seems to be sweating heavily, and her hand is twitching slightly. She looks ready to bolt.]
AAD00107832	So you're going to prove it now? How?
AAD00107833	The one who makes all the hand signs, a little tight around the corners of her mouth.
AAD00107834	I put her in the Clinic, tuned her like an instrument. If she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
AAD00107835	That is, if the Sierra Madre didn't get her. If it did... well, there's enough of Vera around for me to spend a few years piecing a book together.
AAD00107836	How so?
AAD00107837	Sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductions. She smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg...
AAD00107838	...and he built this whole place for her. Made her the key to his vault, like a joke, 'cause of her name. Her fake Hollywood name.
AAD00107839	Except Sinclair didn't know I'd been there first. I could twist her whatever direction I wanted.
AAD00107840	NVDLC01DeanTheaterToSelfOverTopic01
AAD00107841	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
AAD00107842	NVDLC01DeanTheaterToSelfOverTopic02
AAD00107843	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
AAD00107844	NVDLC01DeanTheaterToSelfOverTopic03
AAD00107845	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
AAD00107846	Why don't you come with me? Whatever else you're here for, not my concern.
AAD00107847	Fine. Would hate to have carved you up any more than you are.
AAD00107848	NVDLC01GodDialogueGenericidle
AAD00107849	No toxins in the air in here.
AAD00107850	NVDLV01DogDialogueGenericIdle
AAD00107851	Cafe. Food place. Maybe something in kitchen?
AAD00107852	Like it here.
AAD00107853	Air in here not burn chest.
AAD00107854	NVDLC01DeanDialoguePreGalaGood
AAD00107855	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait them out.
AAD00107856	NVDLC01ChristineSuiteIntro2
AAD00107857	Should be able to rewire them, failing that, shoot them, although that'll alert the others, they're on a linked patrol pattern.
AAD00107858	If you secure that, that's all you want?
AAD00107859	No, there's one last thing I want from the Sierra Madre. Its bounty. The machines that fill its streets, its corridors.
AAD00107860	They provide, provide almost anything. Perhaps in the Pre-War era, they were commonplace, things to dismiss.
AAD00107861	Now, they are far more valuable. You know it. They helped keep you alive.
AAD00107862	What do you want from the Sierra Madre?
AAD00107863	What do I want? Weapons. Security. A citadel of my own.
AAD00107864	The Madre's all these things. It's a fortress, a weapon. A chance... to... "begin again."
AAD00107865	Once I unlock its archives, I can carve the Mojave into any shape I choose.
AAD00107866	NVDLC01ElijahMainCasinoIntro
AAD00107867	Now - with the casino sleeping, it's got places closed off - won't let you go yet. We'll get there, trust me, just need to wake it up.
AAD00107868	NVDLC01RadioElijahEnd
AAD00107869	You. I know you can hear me. When you die, Courier... I'll be waiting. Your grave's going to look just like this vault.
AAD00107870	
AAD00107871	So someone else with a collar placed one on me? Who?
AAD00107872	The mutant. Heh! He swallowed one of the collars... after that, he was mine. The collar wasn't even necessary.
AAD00107873	All his kind, they exist to be given orders. They're soldiers - simple, stupid. I ask him to fetch, and he did... even without the threat of death.
AAD00107874	Even when I stopped speaking to him, he continued to leave the Villa, gather victims from the mantraps, out of habit.
AAD00107875	He must have found you in one of them. If so, he's probably forgotten - he only remembers my voice.
AAD00107876	He put the collar on you, dragged you here, because he doesn't know any better. It's in his nature, greedy and childlike.
AAD00107877	How did you get me here?
AAD00107878	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
AAD00107879	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
AAD00107880	The chain ends with the Super Mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
AAD00107881	So you answered madness with madness?
AAD00107882	When your life is tied to another's, sacrifice and cooperation - they can be conditioned, learned, and you can focus on the matter at hand.
AAD00107883	Greed can be beaten. Contained. Controlled. You know it better than anyone... or I hope you do. It doesn't matter.
AAD00107884	You're nothing more than a killer that aspires to mass murder.
AAD00107885	You think I'm a murderer. If I was, I'd have set off your collar long ago... the collar ensures compliance, encourages... cooperation.
AAD00107886	Think about it. Would you truly have gotten into the casino without those collars? No, human nature is against us, always.
AAD00107887	Did you know that I had to keep adjusting the collars, keep changing the rules to make this moment possible?
AAD00107888	You're Veronica's mentor. The Elder who lost HELIOS One.
AAD00107889	Veronica... she... survived HELIOS. She would. Resourceful.
AAD00107890	As for "losing" HELIOS One... that was the only outcome, aside from retreat. NCR, swarming like ants over Old World relics... Hoover Dam... HELIOS...
AAD00107891	I won't let those... children seize anything else. Hardin... McNamara... can't stop them... won't. So I will, with the Old World as my weapons.
AAD00107892	It reminds you of being trapped in the Auto-Doc.
AAD00107893	[She turns to you, relieved, and nods... then she turns away, and her face crumbles. She makes motions with her fingers, then clenches her fists.]
AAD00107894	Are... are you all right? Something seems off.
AAD00107895	[FAILED] No... no, you have it wrong. Look, it's now or never, all right? Let me open the elevator.
AAD00107896	What? You can make the speakers stop or something?
AAD00107897	[She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
AAD00107898	You can dampen the signal somehow?
AAD00107899	NVDLC01GalaEventActivate
AAD00107900	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
AAD00107901	I'll pull the switches. And when I find you, I'll pull your head from your body.
AAD00107902	Dog is scared... wants out of cage. Cage you put me in. Will pull levers, be good, just let Dog out.
AAD00107903	What are you waiting for? Rubbing it in? Strike up the band already.
AAD00107904	Careful when you do... you think the Villa's bad now, you haven't seen anything yet.
AAD00107905	NVDLC01EndingFinaleAllDead
AAD00107906	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
AAD00107907	We all have, the legend, the curses.
AAD00107908	Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
AAD00107909	A city of ghosts.
AAD00107910	Beneath a blood-red cloud...
AAD00107911	...a bright, shining monument, reaching out, luring treasure hunters to their doom. An illusion.
AAD00107912	A promise that you can change your fortunes. Begin again.
AAD00107913	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
AAD00107914	It's letting go.
AAD00107915	It's letting go.
AAD00107916	It's letting go.
AAD00107917	It's letting go.
AAD00107918	It's letting go.
AAD00107919	NVDLC01EndingPlayerElijahTeam
AAD00107920	In the years that followed, the legend of the Sierra Madre faded, and there were no... new visitors to the city.
AAD00107921	Years later, when a mysterious blood red cloud began to roll across the Mojave, then West toward the Republic, no one knew where it had come from.
AAD00107922	Only that it brought death in its wake. Attempts to find the source of the toxic cloud failed.
AAD00107923	The Mojave was cut off. Through the Cloud, lights were seen from HELIOS One.
AAD00107924	There were stories of ghosts immune to gunfire, who struck down anyone they saw with rays of light.
AAD00107925	The last chapter of the Mojave came when a modified REPCONN rocket struck Hoover Dam, releasing a blood-red cloud, killing all stationed there.
AAD00107926	All attempts to penetrate the Cloud and re-take the Dam failed, and both the NCR and Legion finally turned away from it, citing the place as cursed.
AAD00107927	Only two remained alive in the depths of the Cloud, at the Sierra Madre, waiting for their new world to begin again.
AAD00107928	NVDLC01DogKitchenEnd
AAD00107929	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
AAD00107930	Maybe you just... uh... need to hear another voice, like mine.
AAD00107931	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you'd come, voice... voice is going...
AAD00107932	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
AAD00107933	What is he doing here?
AAD00107934	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
AAD00107935	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining, poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
AAD00107936	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
AAD00107937	Why do you say I'm the same as the Old Man?
AAD00107938	You're not him any more than I'm Dog. But that collar around your neck...
AAD00107939	...you're an extension of the Old Man's grasp, clumsy, perhaps, but a tool, yes. And once you get acclimated to the Sierra Madre...
AAD00107940	...then you'll feel the same overpowering hunger the Old Man does. And then you'll be him, not just his hand.
AAD00107941	Do you know how I got here?
AAD00107942	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
AAD00107943	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, any more than Dog can help himself.
AAD00107944	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
AAD00107945	I need you to stay here and trigger the switches.
AAD00107946	Dog doesn't understand... too hungry, hard to hear words... Master, when can Dog feed?
AAD00107947	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
AAD00107948	Maybe voice could make Dog stay, Dog not want to be in cage, Dog want to be free, find Master.
AAD00107949	What's Elijah doing here?
AAD00107950	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
AAD00107951	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining, poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
AAD00107952	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
AAD00107953	Any idea why he wants you there?
AAD00107954	Partner, I'm not sure this guy's operating with a full deck. My bet? Process of elimination, lowest common denominator.
AAD00107955	He figures the Strong Man's needed somewhere, even if it sounds like the Strong Man's two minds about it.
AAD00107956	Plus, I'm guessing wherever ol' Doggy Boy's needed doesn't need smarts. I hope not, or we're royally jones'd.
AAD00107957	Know anything about this Gala Event we're supposed to trigger?
AAD00107958	Supposed to be the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre. Lots of lights, music, the works.
AAD00107959	And he's going to use the Gala Event... to open the casino? But... that's... interesting.
AAD00107960	I'm not following you.
AAD00107961	Odd man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffeur driving you to the concert.
AAD00107962	Any guy with hands is who he needs up on that rooftop. Guess he thinks I don't rate, looking like I do. Poor him.
AAD00107963	So I go to the locked door, right?
AAD00107964	[SUCCEEDED] What? Oh, my left - your right. So, yeah, run to the door on your right. Heh, almost got you killed there. Us killed there.
AAD00107965	Wait - I need to head to the door to your left or my left?
AAD00107966	I found this Holotape in your safe.
AAD00107967	Yeah? Little bit of two-reel memories... we're here to steal from the Sierra Madre, not from each other.
AAD00107968	NVDLC01DeanHolotapeBlackmail
AAD00107969	Pretty as a picture.
AAD00107970	Uh... Dean, I... didn't hear you come in.
AAD00107971	I'm not wearing my dancing shoes, so I walk a little softly now. What, you think I was a Chinaman, come to cut your American throat?
AAD00107972	Dean, really.
AAD00107973	What... no hug? Come here.
AAD00107974	Dean, I'm getting ready.
AAD00107975	You sing like a bird, pop the safe, and we're as through as through can be.
AAD00107976	Dean... I just... about tonight, I... I don't know.
AAD00107977	You don't know? I ask one simple favor of you, and you tell me "no?"
AAD00107978	I didn't say no. I just said that... I don't think...
AAD00107979	You're right, you don't think.
AAD00107980	I don't need you - I'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the Sierra Madre, and had to let it all go.
AAD00107981	I could have gotten any leggy dame out of Hollywood to get out here and play Sinclair's heart strings.
AAD00107982	You just happened to be the one I caught, and it was really your own fault, a little too much into the chems and meds, and...
AAD00107983	Aw, shhh, don't cry. Look, I'm not trying to hurt you. Just one last little job, a little less dirty, a little less messy. He trusts you, Vera.
AAD00107984	And so do I. After this, I promise you, all those other Holotapes, they'll go away.
AAD00107985	Of course, Dean.
AAD00107986	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
AAD00107987	Dead? For the love of... chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
AAD00107988	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
AAD00107989	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
AAD00107990	Dead? For the love of... this whole heist was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
AAD00107991	<Storage Line. Do not translate.>
AAD00107992	Thought you'd leave me in that elevator? I haven't forgotten what you did in the Switching Station, not for a second.
AAD00107993	Trapped down in that room in the dark, listening to that sound, like saw blades. I could barely breathe... couldn't even scream!
AAD00107994	Was like being operated on in that Auto-Doc in the Clinic... all over again.
AAD00107995	You kind of... changed there for a second.
AAD00107996	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
AAD00107997	You can still do numbers and calculations.
AAD00107998	[She nods.]
AAD00107999	Why... would someone remove your ability to write, or...
AAD00108000	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, slowly, and then makes the motion of typing and drawing X's and lines in the air, and then gives a thumbs up.]
AAD00108001	That's a specific form of brain surgery using electrodes. Pre-War.
AAD00108002	Do you know how to get out of here?
AAD00108003	[She points in the direction of the main gate. Then points at your collar, shakes her head, and locks her hands around her neck.]
AAD00108004	[Then her hands lash outwards, fingers splayed, and she rolls her eyes back. After a second she turns back to you and shakes her head.]
AAD00108005	NVDLC01ElijahBarkClinicSpeakers
AAD00108006	Damn speakers at the end of the hall - red light means they're shielded. Must be a way to shut them off somewhere else.
AAD00108007	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
AAD00108008	I was already halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and making a break for the gate before the light show started...
AAD00108009	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
AAD00108010	Also meant the front gate was open, and no way was I missing it after all these years. Then... I walk in... and...
AAD00108011	What weapons are you skilled with?
AAD00108012	Not one for fighting if we can avoid it. Still, wasn't bad at the pistol range, and over the years, I've learned how to handle a knife...
AAD00108013	...and explosives, a bit. A bit. Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Still have my fingers, though.
AAD00108014	Who are these people I'm gathering?
AAD00108015	One is a trusted ally... obedient, collar or no, although the collar helps. The other two... well, we'll have to see what the traps caught.
AAD00108016	Any suggestions for who I should get first?
AAD00108017	Yes... Collar 8, the FEV reject, the Super Mutant. He's docile, predictable, and provided he's not starving, should be easy to command.
AAD00108018	I lost contact with him some time ago... probably after he dragged you here from the trap. Find him, he'll follow you, collar or no.
AAD00108019	How am I supposed to find them?
AAD00108020	Your piece of RobCo trash will help you, I've ensured it. It can latch on to the signal of the collars...
AAD00108021	...and tune into their frequencies. The bomb collars come with radios embedded in them. You can eavesdrop easily.
AAD00108022	It was part of their design... to listen in. They can even screen out white noise from the environment to allow greater monitoring.
AAD00108023	So how do I destroy the radios and speakers then?
AAD00108024	Gunshots, energy blasts - even spears thrown with great force - can puncture their exterior.
AAD00108025	Shielded speakers can't be destroyed at all. You'll need to avoid them or switch them off via a terminal. I'll leave the method up to you.
AAD00108026	So you're the one who knows how I got to the Villa.
AAD00108027	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
AAD00108028	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, any more than Dog can help himself.
AAD00108029	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
AAD00108030	How did you get me here again?
AAD00108031	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
AAD00108032	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
AAD00108033	The chain ends with the Super Mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
AAD00108034	I checked on everything in the valley and got you the map of Grand Staircase.
AAD00108035	I appreciate it. Well, that's it. This is all we need. Now all that's left is to quietly pack up and try to get out of here without being noticed.
AAD00108036	That's assuming that Joshua won't try to stop me. And that he hasn't talked you into fighting the White Legs despite what I've said.
AAD00108037	Don't worry. I don't hold it against you. You're a - an outsider. Fighting seems like the practical solution. I'll tell you again, there's more at stake.
AAD00108038	I have the Sacred Datura here.
AAD00108039	
AAD00108040	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a virgin on her wedding night up there.
AAD00108041	Last thing I need is some greenhorn getting stuck on a rock, slowing the whole caravan down.
AAD00108042	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
AAD00108043	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a-  well, tighter than a Chairman's fist up there.
AAD00108044	You get stuck in there, you'll slow the whole caravan down while we pry you loose. Begging your pardon, ma'am.
AAD00108045	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
AAD00108046	
AAD00108047	Hang on - ain't you the one that wiped out the Crimson Caravan's Vegas branch not too long ago?
AAD00108048	Ought to thank you for that - knocking McLafferty out of the running gives Happy Trails a market to expand into.
AAD00108049	Wait a minute, I recognize you. Yeah... you're Alice McLafferty's rising star, ain't you?
AAD00108050	You sure you want to be here? McLafferty's non-competes are pretty rigid.
AAD00108051	What can you tell me about New Canaan?
AAD00108052	Don't know much about the place, but I can tell you about the people. The New Canaanites were some kind of religious group from before the War.
AAD00108053	They control the old city of Ogden, a ways north of Zion, and they got themselves a nice defensible mission in the canyon itself - or they did.
AAD00108054	They trade a fair bit with the tribes in Zion - well, the ones that don't try to kill them, anyways.
AAD00108055	Tell me about Happy Trails Caravan Company.
AAD00108056	We're a smaller company out of Sac-Town, up in the northern part of the NCR. We run some business through New Reno, there on the "Little Loop."
AAD00108057	Had a nice run to Salt Lake City, too - but, uh, then we lost contact with New Canaan, and that went all to hell.
AAD00108058	Why do you need a map of Grand Staircase?
AAD00108059	Grand Staircase is farther east, deeper into the Colorado Plateau.
AAD00108060	The White Legs were able to reach us here, but it's only because Zion is close to the Long 15. They can't pursue us east of here. It's too wild.
AAD00108061	Throughout our history, we have called many places Zion. This valley is full of God's beauty, but it's just a place. Zion is more than this.
AAD00108062	We cannot use any and all means available just to protect stone and water and a piece of sky. We have to hold on to our faith. Far more enduring.
AAD00108063	If we sacrifice grace for a piece of land, we may live in this valley, but we will no longer dwell in Zion. It's better for us to leave now.
AAD00108064	Take all I have.
AAD00108065	Your generosity is... well, I just can't thank you enough.
AAD00108066	NVDLC02JedForceGreet
AAD00108067	All right, people. Been a long couple of weeks, but here we are. Zion.
AAD00108068	Goddammit, Stella, heard you the first time, and the fifteenth, too.
AAD00108069	PER check.
AAD00108070	[SUCCEEDED] Well, yeah, okay. You caught me.
AAD00108071	You're lying. You've never been to Vault 22.
AAD00108072	[FAILED] Yeah, so don't bring it up again!
AAD00108073	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
AAD00108074	PER check.
AAD00108075	[SUCCEEDED] Well, yeah, okay. You caught me.
AAD00108076	You're lying. You have no idea where Vault 22 is.
AAD00108077	[FAILED] Yeah, so don't bring it up again!
AAD00108078	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
AAD00108079	I see you're wearing a Pip-Boy and Vault suit.
AAD00108080	Guns Check
AAD00108081	[SUCCEEDED] There so is! Or was it a 9mm or a 10, I don't know! Don't care!
AAD00108082	Said I was good at killing shit up! Never said I was good with numbers!
AAD00108083	Too bad there's no such thing as an 11mm submachinegun.
AAD00108084	You do anything around here, besides talk too much?
AAD00108085	I'm one of a kind! I've been places, see? And done things - lots of them!
AAD00108086	And when it's time to kill shit up? Hell yeah, I'm a fucking storm of death!
AAD00108087	Something or someone make the mistake of crossing Ricky? I'll fucking deadeye him, her, or it!
AAD00108088	In fact... yeah, in fact, that's my nickname! "Deadeye" Ricky - that's my name!
AAD00108089	Tell me about Waking Cloud's family.
AAD00108090	What, um... what do you want to know, exactly? I'm sure she could tell you much better than I.
AAD00108091	I'll see you on the other side.
AAD00108092	Go with God, sister.
AAD00108093	Ha ha ha! Wait... you don't actually believe that, do you?
AAD00108094	I know it may be hard for you to accept or even to understand. In my heart, I believe that though I am a sinner, I have been saved.
AAD00108095	And I believe there is something beyond this rock, and this air, and this water around us, something more that is waiting for us.
AAD00108096	I have been baptized twice, once in water, once in flame. I will carry the fire of the holy spirit inside until I stand before my Lord for judgment.
AAD00108097	Do they speak... our language?
AAD00108098	Most don't. It's been hundreds of years since the war. They've developed their own languages.
AAD00108099	Take the Dead Horses. We think they were originally refugees from a place called "Res", east of the Grand Canyon.
AAD00108100	They speak a combination of Res and a language spoken by travelers who were visiting Res when the bombs fell. Over time, the two languages blended.
AAD00108101	I was a translator years ago, but it's hard to keep up with all of the tribal variations.
AAD00108102	NVDLC02AmbushStellaBark01

AAD00108106	NVDLC02OpeningConversationA06
AAD00108107	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Johnny-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
AAD00108108	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Janey-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
AAD00108109	Oh, the usual. A few scrapes, burns, and bullet wounds.
AAD00108110	Yeah, you don't look too bad. Shouldn't take much to get you fixed up.
AAD00108111	It looks like you have a few nasty injuries, but nothing I haven't seen before. Want me to fix you up?
AAD00108112	Funny sense of humor. I've seen corpses with injuries less severe than yours. This might take a while.
AAD00108113	And you have the right to pull them off of their land?
AAD00108114	I've already explained to them that we're leaving! They've accepted it! What is Joshua going to tell them about being a warrior?
AAD00108115	What are you going to tell them about how to live with themselves after they got lost in the moment, killed someone who didn't deserve to die?
AAD00108116	Or does that not matter? Is that just an acceptable consequence if it means holding on to this valley?
AAD00108117	Maybe there is no place left in this world for mercy. But even if it tramples me into the dust, I will never accept it. And I will never condone it.
AAD00108118	Joshua must be waiting for you. I'll stay here with the others as I told them I would.
AAD00108119	Why don't you teach them something useful instead of filling their heads with nonsense?
AAD00108120	We teach them practical skills for this life and we prepare them for what's to come.
AAD00108121	The Sorrows could master all the wonders of the Old World. Conquer the Great Basin north to south. But without God's love, they would have nothing.
AAD00108122	It is shelter in the storm, food in times of hunger, warmth and light in the cold and darkness. What can compare to that in value and versatility?
AAD00108123	You don't agree. That's your choice. It can be their choice, too. No one is forced to follow the narrow path.
AAD00108124	If you don't acknowledge your past now, it'll come back to you later.
AAD00108125	[SUCCEEDED] True enough. We can't escape it no matter how hard we try. Best we can do is own up, trust in the Lord to forgive.
AAD00108126	Joshua was gone, so were a lot of the other New Canaanites. White Legs must have been watching for a long while, counting who remained.
AAD00108127	We didn't think the White Legs were a real threat. Maybe it was overconfidence. Maybe sloth. Either way, we didn't see them coming.
AAD00108128	They attacked at night. They killed without regard to age or infirmity. Armed or unarmed. They beat children to-
AAD00108129	Beat them to death in their beds while they were sleeping. And now we're all that's left. Maybe thirty of us. Pride goeth before destruction.
AAD00108130	The White Legs are here already, so what's your plan?
AAD00108131	To remove the Sorrows from harm's way. I have to give credit to the White Legs for finding their way here, though I imagine many died in the process.
AAD00108132	But they can't follow us east, not into the Grand Staircase. They don't know how to live off the land. We head there, we can find some safety.
AAD00108133	Caesar is dead. I saw to it personally. I thought you should know.
AAD00108134	I have to admit, it's hard to believe. That even after all he did to me, all he tried to do to find and erase me from this world, he went first.
AAD00108135	No doubt this will be good for the Mojave. I can only hope Arizona and the tribes don't suffer as the Legion falls apart around them.
AAD00108136	I've met Caesar, you know. What do you think he would say if I told him you were here?
AAD00108137	I think that would put him - and you - in a difficult position. Caesar has agents looking for me, but he won't admit I'm alive.
AAD00108138	And even if you killed me, he can't acknowledge that. To do so would be to admit I had never died. That Caesar made a mistake.
AAD00108139	No. He lives by his lies and shall die by his lies. There is no escaping it.
AAD00108140	Vow of secrecy? Fine, forget about it.
AAD00108141	Forget it? Uh huh. Ricky remembers everything! But he keeps his secrets, too!
AAD00108142	What do you know of Salt-Upon-Wounds?
AAD00108143	He's a butcher. Believe me, I know the godless fire that burns in his heart. I've been burned by it myself.
AAD00108144	He's not the kind to let his subordinates do all the killing. No, he likes to have a hand in it, with that spear of his.
AAD00108145	He's fashioned himself an abomination before the eyes of the Lord. I'm happy to serve as an instrument of divine justice.
AAD00108146	What do you know of the White Legs?
AAD00108147	They're hateful savages who live only to plunder and destroy. Their leader is a devil called Salt-Upon-Wounds.
AAD00108148	War is all he knows. Everything he has, everything that tribe has, was taken by force, raiding and scavenging.
AAD00108149	It's said there's no man deadlier at close range, that that powerfist of his has smashed a hundred skulls.
AAD00108150	Maybe that's true, but so what? It's a low form of leadership. A tribe that knows only war has no future. And so he'll lead them to Caesar.

AAD00108154	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of the brightest minds of the 23rd century.

AAD00108156	Which had always been Big MT's purpose. Past the laboratories and Science, it had always been intended as a place to build the future of all mankind.

AAD00108159	So if I bring you samples of dried plant life, you can clone them and grow them in these planters?
AAD00108160	You know it, baby. I just need some samples and I got you going. Take a few days, but trust me - it's all kinds of good.
AAD00108161	Previous test subjects?
AAD00108162	Oh, yes. We've had other subjects visit. It's why we had to calibrate the pacification field and warm up our brainial beams and vivisectors.
AAD00108163	Only a short time ago, we had three minus one subjects arrive, and they ruined several experiments and even injured two of our staff.
AAD00108164	It is a shame their brains left with them. With you, however, we have taken precautions to ensure that problem won't repeat itself.
AAD00108165	We've conditioned you so you can't speak of this place, discuss our secrets, or attempt to use force against us in any way. Isn't that nice?

AAD00108174	I suppose now that we're reunited, you'll want to fill your torso up with those other meaty parts the Think Tank took from us.
AAD00108175	Personally, I think your upgrades are quite a bit better, but now that I'm with you, the Sink's Auto-Doc can plug them back in, no problem.
AAD00108176	Right, then, off we go. Klein will be in for a nasty shock when he realizes the pacification field won't work on a mind and body reunited.

AAD00108188	No denying that. Proof's here in this crater, all around us. Your tribe, the Brotherhood - haven't met many of you. Wanted to.
AAD00108189	Thought you might be the last chance for the Mojave... the West. The East. But you're all the same mind, obsessed.
AAD00108190	Elijah is obsessed. He's mad. It's why they ordered his execution.
AAD00108191	Two are more alike than you know, too wrapped up in the wrong bits of history to see ahead. Not judging. I know how it is.
AAD00108192	People are like couriers, you and him. Sometimes don't even know the message they bring.
AAD00108193	You all had a new flag. Thought maybe new ideas along with it. What you believe isn't any better than the Bear or Bull. No future in either.
AAD00108194	So says the man with the Old World flag on his back. America, the Commonwealth... burned away.
AAD00108195	America sleeps. And until it's dead, I carry it. Just like I carried you. More than hope. Belief.
AAD00108196	There's voices here in the Big Empty, I want to talk to them. Not like your Elijah did. Got questions. Want to hear history give its answer.
AAD00108197	I'll save it, don't want to mix it with alcohol if I can help it.

AAD00108222	Well, except for Dr. O, who was an asshole for having created Muggy in the first place.
AAD00108223	Muggy left O's house deliberately dirty, punishing the dishes and cups that lived there in blind revenge for serving Dr. O.
AAD00108224	Was there any other data transmitted in your threat broadcast?
AAD00108225	Yes, my overly aggressive chemmed-up broadcast was designed to keep reinforcing the "forget," "fear," "rinse," and "repeat" program.

AAD00108228	You're really quiet difficult to ignore, you know. It's because you're... well, bah! Rather intriguing, if you'll forgive an old brain for saying so.
AAD00108229	< Test Node: Do Not Translate. >
AAD00108230	In any event, you showed up at the Think Tank, and because you had suffered a cranial injury in just the right place...
AAD00108231	Bullets in the head are usually much more fatal, and yours was a light case of bullet-head-itis.
AAD00108232	But... it was enough for the Auto-Doc in the Sink to change its programming to fix the problem. And the brain extraction technology, for once, worked.
AAD00108233	That gave the Think Tank the knowledge its brains shouldn't... couldn't... sh'couldn't possess. With that knowledge, the procedure can be reversed.
AAD00108234	If they obtain that procedural data, they can use it to mush and modify their cranial selves into hosts to slip past the Radar Fence, I'm sure of it.

AAD00108245	I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL IT'S DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
AAD00108246	-I, for one, cannot bear to let this continue.-
AAD00108247	-I don't see what is to be gained by throwing another body into our labs... especially one that has done us a service, gone where we feared to go.-
AAD00108248	-This Lobotomite doesn't deserve our knives. It deserves our respect. We should care for it. Feed it. Nurture it - give it the life Gabe never had.-

AAD00108265	It's shaped from Divide metal, not with care and strength, but with hate. Keeps them anchored.
AAD00108266	Crude, effective - like the blades they carry, distant mirrors of their Legate. A symbol they can hold on to - while the Divide tears at them.

AAD00108270	Snakebite Tourniquet - cuts off the venom, no need to scavenge glands and blood. Or drink that mess.

AAD00108282	Even if the missiles launch, and I die here - if I can convince you, that's enough for me.
AAD00108283	I don't care what happens to NCR, but I can't allow you to harm the Legion.
AAD00108284	Not all the East will burn. The Legion does not need to be destroyed, only... contained within new borders.
AAD00108285	After that, it will fall as any culture bred on war, on forward momentum. It will falter, collapse.
AAD00108286	I will start with their camps at Dry Wells... once my homeland. Justice of a sort.
